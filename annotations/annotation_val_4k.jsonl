And so it looks a bit too casual and pedestrian. She's in this really non-specific shape here. It looks like she's kind of just putting her weight on a straight right leg. So again, when there's not any cushion or spring in the knees, it can make the movement look like low energy. And that's most likely because what's happening is she's resting on her joints rather than her muscles. So there frankly is lower energy there. The head movement here would be more effective if the elbows were out. She's kind of let her elbows collapse in a little bit here. So it makes it again look imprecise and weak. Quite imprecise and too small here as well. I'd love to see her exaggerate this more. She's sort of being kind of stiff with her arm movements and allowing she's doing this circular movement with her torso and the arms are sort of just Following that doesn't look intentional. It kind of looks stiff and awkward again Very weak base here. Her feet are too close together. Her knees are collapsing inwards She needs a little bit of a wider base to really move in a strong way This little section with these windmills with her arms, quite weak as well because it looks good for a moment as she's bringing the arms around, but then as soon as one arm comes in front of her face, she drops the windmill shape, and so she loses all the nice patterns that she had developed in the air. This movement also looks pretty stiff here, so what she's doing is bringing this arm around in front of her as her torso bends forward. The reason that it looks stiff, a couple of reasons. One is her knees are sort of collapsing inward, which is not a strong place to be dancing in. It'd be better if her feet were next to each other rather than in this front and back orientation. And also a bit further apart so she could have a nice strong base with a plie here and direct this movement from her pelvis. She's directing the movement from her chest and so that's partly why it looks stiff and weak because this is not a strong place to move from. If she was driving this movement with her pelvis it would look so much stronger. The arm looks good, nice straight elbow, very clear shape. The head gazing forward while the rest of the torso is bent makes this look quite awkward and stiff as well. She's doing a good job with the follow-through of this hand. She brought the hand in front of her face and has brought it all the way behind her head. So that's an example of good follow-through here. Again, lack of attack here. The music is very strong and it's also this particular section, this three counts here or three beats, three moments here are quite strong and sharp, but she's moving much more, she's technically on the beat, but she's using this sort of legato dynamic to what she's doing and so it really again looks more like someone who's sort of marking it rather than doing it full out. I'd love to see her exaggerate it and add more attack and more texture and dynamics to her movement. This is the most dynamic she has been so far in this choreography, so I'd encourage her to find ways to embrace the vibe of this little section and put that throughout the piece. She's got a lot of energy, she's moving her arms in a pretty clear and precise way that looks really well balanced by counterbalance by her leg movements. She's moving on the balls of her feet which is helping her to move quickly and smoothly, so this is a really nice little section for her. Again, lack of energy here. She's done this sort of ball change behind her. This could have been like even a little bit of a leap or something to just give this some interesting dynamics, but there's a lack of attack. And so again, not super interesting. Again, this movement is way too small, not exaggerated enough. I needed her to plie through this right leg more, leap onto the left foot as she's turning, keep this knee straight out, and also have the arms much more connected and in sync with the legs. The arms are a little bit behind. Because she didn't do any of those things, and also you can see she's quite weak through her, I don't know exactly which part of her body is weak, but her knees continue to collapse inward. And so that's not a strong place to be moving from. So this turn really doesn't come across very well. It's way too small and lacks follow through. She's doing a pretty good job here of isolating her ribcage. However, again, there's a lack of dynamics. There's a lack of attack There's a lack of energy And so it really again, it just doesn't look super interesting. It's giving this sort of a monotone Vibe and the low energy coming from her makes it just less interesting for her viewer Also, there's an imprecision and lack of clarity with the arms in this section as well This is good arm movements on both sides. She did a nice straight elbow and a nice arc to the front of her body and then slowly brought a graceful hand in front of her body and she did this consistently with good follow-through on both sides. Here she started the choreography. The main issue I have with her performance is that she doesn't exaggerate the movements and actually do them fully. She gives this vibe of like she's marking this, not that she's doing it full out. She doesn't exaggerate the movements enough to make them look crisp and performative. This is supposed to be a kick. She does a tiny little kick here, but she doesn't really get this knee straight. She has plenty of music to do it, but she doesn't attack it soon enough, so she can't fully get there. Also, that's reflected in her arm shape here. There's not a lot of energy coming from her core out through her arms. There's not a lot coming out through her facial expressions either. So what I'd like her to do is exaggerate her movements and attack them more. This series of turns is very weak and choppy and clunky and that's because she is using her hip as her pivot point rather than the balls of her feet. So what she's doing is planting one foot fully on the floor and then turning around that hip and then doing the opposite with the other side. So she's having to do four to five movements per turn instead of one to two movements and so she ends up kind of imprecisely moving across the floor in this sort of bumpy way. Also she's not really spotting her head and that would also help her to be a bit more precise and stay in one place as she turns. This is a really nice shape with these arms here, great elbows, great shoulders, really nice graceful wrists and hands. My problem is again the dynamics. She came up really slowly and then tipped her arms forward, so it's giving this sort of like wilting flower vibe that does not fit at all with this music. I think this would have been much more effective if she would have hit the shape quickly with attack again, attack, attack. There's not enough texture and dynamics in what she's doing here, and that's part of why. Also again, low energy through the lower half of the body. I would encourage her to think about what can she do to connect these two halves of her body and dance with her whole body the whole time. Here she's doing this turn where she swings the knee out and in front of her body. This is a really ineffective moment for her, again low energy. There's low energy in what she's doing, there's not a lot of strength, there's not any really major exaggeration, so it all looks kind of weak, wilting, and monotone. Also as she's turning here it's good that she's got her weight a little bit forward on the ball of her foot. You can see there's some space between her heel and the floor, that's good, that means that she's going to use the small pivot point of her ball of her foot to turn. She's not doing anything with her arms of interest, her arms are sort of reactionary. Here I'd love to see her either make a shape with the arms that reflects what's happening with the legs or do something with them to help her momentum in this turn. This leg is also not very precise, I'd love to see her choose a shape that looks a little bit more clear and intentional. Again, a good shape here with the arms and hands, but she doesn't attack it enough, so she runs out of music, so she can't hold the shape at all, so it doesn't read very well as a shape, and also again, lack of texture is making the whole piece sort of monotone. Here's a little transition moment that looks really weak. It's, she doesn't, she kind of stands here in a way for a moment. It's not really clear what she's about to do. Part of the reason that that doesn't, that it looks low energy in her lower half of her body, she doesn't keep a soft knee. This knee here is very, very straight. It's really hard to continue moving from a place of straight knee. It's, it's appropriate to have a straight knee from time to time, but when you don't have any spring in that joint, that's one reason that movement can look kind of bored. Like she's almost like she's bored or like she's marking and not doing a full out. Good job with this arm here. She's bringing, she brought it up in front of her chest with a bent elbow and is swinging it around with a nice straight elbow here. However, again, not a lot of energy is kind of hanging, her hand is sort of hanging there. There's not a lot of oomph into these steps that she's taking here. I'd love to see her attack this arm movement more, but keep this nice shape that she made.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

Yeah, it seems to be the ring finger or possibly the middle finger on the top notes that is not speaking clearly, which skews the rhythm. The hammer-on effect, via placing the finger down in between the plucking of the right hand, was very clean. The speed of the previous section compared to this slower section could have been exaggerated further by starting the slowdown earlier. It would have made for a less drastic ritardando and a smoother transition from one section to the other. Placement of fingertips on strings in relation to frets is very good. You can tell with the clarity of each note when plucking and switching between positions and chords. This is a correct use of this cord to easily switch between other cords when the other two fingers are required. The right hand plucking has deteriorated in its rhythmic integrity. Regardless of the rushing, musicians left hand is very precise and efficient at switching between the chords. Repetitious thumb notes, bum bum, tends to be a little on the rush side which causes the rest of the finger plucking to get faster. Musicians are also much faster now than they were at the beginning. Curvature of fingers is excellent. Placement of thumb stays consistent when shifting from position to position. Slight hesitation on the top couple of notes may have missed the note or a rhythmic choice made by the composer in the music. This is the first spot where clarity of notes was not clean. After the shift, position of finger on fret was suspect. Experiment with that shift and placement of those fingers to clear up sound. The musician is rushing here. I cannot tell if it's part of the music or if it is a personal choice for practicing. Last harmonic did not speak, consult finger placement and or approach from shift. Shifting was very smooth. You could tell that the hand and forearm was relaxed because the thumb came with the rest of the fingers of the same hand. Plucking of the right hand fingers is very rhythmic and does not rush.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So the climber must continue to apply pressure, especially onto the right hand grip since it's the one that is going to be furthest away from the climber. So he must squeeze on that pinch in order to pull himself back onto the wall. Once the climber gets close towards the wall, he will have to send one of the feet back onto the wall to stabilize the move. For more information, visit www.FEMA.gov Unfortunately the climber on losing the right hand grip, his center of gravity was thrown off and his left hand has also popped from the placement ending the climb. The climber continues to glance over to the hold at reach and is dropping his center of gravity. This one by extending the arms as the climber continues to glance over to the hold at reach, he will have to commit into dynamic move. The dynamic move means that the climber will perform a very quick pull into the wall as soon as he drops the weight and then will have to push forcefully onto the left foot to spring out of his position in order to get the hold at reach. It is important the climber always glances down at the feet, especially if performing a foot switch. The technique that he's applying is called the jump off jump on. So he jumps off the left foot where the heel was applied towards the surface of the hold before the right toe comes into place. Once the climber gets to place the foot, then he will have to create pressure to sustain the foot placement. This type of technique works especially in a large hold or medium-sized hold like this one, but it's often not accurate. This is because the climber might have to readjust the foot placement once the climber gets to place it, and it can take a fair bit of energy. As we can see the climber has sent the left hand over to the next hold at reach, placing the fingers into one side and the thumb onto the other. This is again a pinch grip so the climber must create pressure by squeezing onto the hold. For the climber on making the reach he had brought the right leg to be extended and pushes the foot forward towards the wall. This helps the climber to gain a stability as well as balance when going up for the move. The flag is also to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. The climber was able to reach the next hold that reached this one. The climber had committed a dyno. A dyno means that the climber had pushed forcefully onto the foot, coming out of place and hoping to have land the left hand grip as he has already done, placing the fingers behind the lip of the hold. And to apply extra pressure to the grip, the climber is placing the thumb over the outside to squeeze onto it. This is an immediate drop of his weight to the highest grip, so the climber must create a lot of pressure onto that left hand grip to sustain the swing. Eventually the climber will go out onto a swing. Since both of their feet are out in the air, this is called cutting feet. The moment that the climber had swapped the feet, kept the right leg extended. This is called flagging out, so he's able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. And at this time, the climber is glancing over to the next hold at reach. This one, the climber is keeping the left knee out to keep the hips square when performing the move. At this moment, the climber had brought the right toe to be pressed against the wall so that he's able to balance over the move as well as gaining a civility on his position. And had committed, as we can see, into a slight pull in. And at this moment, the climber has not gone up for it, so he hesitated for a slight second. This, keeping the arms engaged the whole time, can tire the arms, so the climber must move out of this position quickly. The climber secures the right hand grip and extends the arm right away. This is to transfer over the weight to the grip. Keeping the arm extended is ideal when climbing so the climber doesn't have to engage on the arm muscles giving it a moment for recovery. Now the climber is glancing down at the feet and he's performing a foot switch. This time the climber is bringing the left toe to come into place above the hold. Once creating pressure he's able to release the right foot from its place. The clamber making hand gestures is called visualizing. So he is shaping with his hands the way that he will sustain the hold, as well as throwing the hand from move to move to solve the sequence. As the climber was returning back onto the wall from the swing, he has engaged into the core. This to recover the move by sending the foot towards a hold on the wall in order to stabilize. But in doing so, when the climber was pulling himself in, his right hand has slipped off the hold. Now the climber is only having one point of contact, being the highest grip, which just came into place, potentially not being placed correctly as it was a one-shot, where the climber didn't have the time to adjust it, which is important. The climber applies a foot in order to reapply the left hand grip. In this case, it will be really hard for the climber to recover the move suddenly this happening, as this is one of his main points of contact in order to return to the wall. So the climber was able to make the next hold at reach, this one bringing the right hand at distance. So the climber once had created a foot switch, had brought the left leg to be extended. This is called flagging out, so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. And right before the climber went up for the move at reach, we can see how he had brought his right knee inwards. This is to keep the right side of the body close to the wall, helping the reach. For the climber to gain a stability on sustaining his center of gravity being in the core towards the wall has been done by the left foot being pushed against the wall. The clamber of creating small pull-ups is to release some of the pressure and readjust the grip as the clamber must create friction and accuracy on the placement by creating pressure, potentially placing the hand further in or finding a better spot for the grip to be squeezed on. The climbers is starting at a one-hold start where he places both of the hands onto the same hold. For the left hand is placed with the fingers flat at the above the hold and brings the palm forward to touch against the hold. This will increase the contact as well as pressure in closing the grip. For the right hand the climber places the fingers at the top and then places the thumb underneath. This will help the climber to squeeze onto the hold to transfer over the weight in creating pressure as well as the climber sustaining onto the pinch the climber must pull the elbow out compared to the left hand grip the climber must continue to bring the elbow also out to the left side and close to the wall when the climber gets to step off the mat. This type of a start the climber is doing a step up start and is placing the left heel behind the edge of the wall above the hold. This type of heel placement the climber then will secure with placing the outer edge of the heel towards the hold and that way the climber once creates pressure will help the climber to bring the hips up to a rise and then transfer over the weight to the placements. Once the climber gets to place the right foot towards the wall and is no longer standing on the mat then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So it really should be a level change here. Her head stays at the same plane as it was before when she was standing up. But this step ultimately should be lower. Her head should be further down in space because she's bending her right knee. She's looking towards the side, which is distracting. She should be looking straight forward and not turning her neck off of alignment with the rest of her back or spine, which is facing forward. The dancer does a good job of straightening both arms here. Both arms are in straight lines, which is really good arm extension. The dancer has really good force in her head when she's circling it here. She drops her chin downward and looks downward to start, and while she's circling her head now she's looking upward into space. So that's really good. She is circling or completing a full circle with her head. It's a really good range of motion there. The dancer also makes an audible noise with her mouth and grabs her pants with her hands, which while she's flustered or frustrated to hear that she forgets the dance, but it makes it more obvious that she forgets the dance by doing these motions. So she really should remain in character and not break character here. The dancer forgets a routine here, so she really needs to go over the steps so that she does not forget the sequence. The dancer is doing a good job here being on her toes with her heels lifted off the ground, both her right heel and her left heel, which is allowing her to execute this twisting motion and both her knees and her hips going side to side because her heels being lifted off the ground gives her that mobility. The dancer is now making her steps smaller. The side basic step that she just did right and left took up a lot less space than the rest of her steps, so she should make all her steps equal. All should be large, none should be smaller than the others. She might or want to or should lower her left arm that's in front of her slightly downward because as we see here she can see her hand so it's blocking her face a bit so she might or should lower her arm to be slightly lower and this in turn would also allow her to lower her shoulders a bit so that her neckline is longer. The dancer is pointing her foot at her ankle joint, which is good, but she's not finishing the line with her toes Her toes are pointed outward even though her ankles pointed downward so her toes should continue aligned with her ankle pointing downward", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

You could also crack it on the edge of the bowl or the countertop, but cracking it with the spoon above the bowl eliminates any egg getting on your countertop or workspace. I believe also that in mixing this omelet or this egg mixture, using a fork or a whisk would have been more appropriate tool than a spoon. Using a fork or a whisk incorporates air into the mixture so you produce a fluffier omelet with that egg. At this point, the omelet is completely cooked on both sides. However, he flips it 10 or 20 more times in rapid succession. This indicates to me that he doesn't have a very strong knowledge of how to cook an omelet. You really only need to flip it one time, cooking on the underside and then flipping it to complete cooking of any raw ingredients on the other side. For a one egg omelet, I would recommend only up to a fourth of a teaspoon of salt. Whenever you're chopping an onion with or any vegetable with an exterior skin, prior to chopping it or slicing it, you want to remove the skin and throw it in the garbage or remove it from your cutting surface, so that there's not an opportunity for that skin to get mixed into the chopped vegetables that you're going to use for the recipe. Here you can see that he is starting to slice his onion that he's going to use for the recipe. But here is all of the skin still sitting on the cutting board. You can tell in his movements that because he's already got the pan on and the oil heating, he feels like he is rushing around to get all of the ingredients now. This is why I always suggest to have all of your ingredients either grabbed or mixed together before you start the heat of the pan. This is a misstep in my opinion. He should wait to start the heat after he's either already gathered his tools and ingredients or finished mixing his omelet mixture. And as you can see, he's trying to pick around the skin that he should have thrown away in order to transfer his actual onion to the mixing bowl. Similarly, he slices his onion in half lengthwise and then begins to chop half of it with the skin still on. You can see that he hasn't taken the skin off here. This flipping and pressing over and over is a very unnecessary step and indicates to me that he isn't efficient with this particular task. He flips the omelet here successfully with very little splatter and then allows it to cook for a few seconds on this side. He seems to be really struggling with getting the entire omelet underneath to be on the flat spatula so that he can flip it. I believe that this is because there is a concentration of heavy and wet ingredients in the center of the omelet. After completely slicing the pepper, he plans to move it into the bowl, but as you can see, he puts his hand directly under the blade of the knife. This is a major mistake, in my opinion. He should have gathered the chopped peppers to the side and then transferred them to the bowl. I'm not exactly sure. This knife is very dull, but this indicates a lack of knowledge of how to appropriately use the tools in this recipe. He does grab a flat spatula, which is an appropriate tool to use. In making this, he adds his omelet mixture or egg mixture into the pan on top of the oil. Step one in making an omelet is gathering all the tools that you will need for this recipe. Here he gathers what is there equivalent to a frying pan. It's a flat surface. It looks to be cast iron. It would be appropriate at this step, as he's mixing his egg mixture to form the omelet, to now put on the heat on the pan. He seasons with half a teaspoon of salt. He has chosen a pepper. It looks like this is a small serrano and then also a red onion. You can see immediately the outside of the omelet is almost cooked while the inside where the egg mixture is thicker and the vegetables are sitting is still raw. This is happening because his mixture is uneven and he didn't spread it out and also because his pan was very hot prior to him adding the egg mixture. This is why I always recommend cutting on the pan after you've assembled or mixed all of your ingredients. Here he is adding to the pan what appears to be a cooking oil, two tablespoons to be exact, and I think that's an appropriate amount for this particular recipe. However, he's adding the oil and cutting on the pan too soon. However, he begins to light the flame before gathering any of the other tools or the ingredients necessary to produce this omelette.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

The climber then gets a left foot up into the second hand in the sequence. And locking this right hand down, the climber is able to snake this left hand up into this undercling pocket here, which I think is quite good. It's only two fingers, but I think it goes pretty deep into the wall. So here, climber started on this hold down here, perched over a really good foot, darted left hand into this jug. Here they are with their feet switched, right foot's on now, and looking up into the wall, proceeding. Kyra then attempts to do a rollout into this crimp here after matching this big orange hold and I just think is too tired and loses. Just is not able to tag that hold. Climber was then able to build their feet off of this undercling jug pocket and roll out into this right-hand jug here.

Snaps that wrist down. Guide hand is not in his shot. Bring that elbow in of the guide arm. And again, you could see how the right leg gets kicked out in front of him. And a lot of his lift and upward motion is coming from the push off of that left foot. Let's balance it out here. My recommendation is maybe moving in closer so you can really work on the feet, getting his feet under him and landing with a more balanced landing. Again, you can see all the weight again falls on that left foot. I like that his feet are apart, but his landing is really that weight's kind of falling back on that left foot. And here again, he kind of short arms it, pulls that follow through back. You can see the bending of the elbow. Let's extend that elbow and keep it out there. And then you can see the landing. He kind of again lands solely on that left foot. I'd love to see more of a balanced landing if you will and hold that follow-through with that right arm. Same thing here, let's extend this elbow shooting hand. Much better job here with the guide hand. Again, when he lands, he's kind of straight up with his weight kind of back a little bit. We love for him to go up and come straight down in the same spot. Again, a lot of his push-off is on the left foot. You can see the right leg go up. And then he lands on his foot as well. So again, just kind of maybe a little casual in his approach here. Would love to see a more stronger, aggressive takeoff and landing. But, you know, he's got a really nice touch. He's got some really good form shooting here. Again, when he lands, he kind of lands straight up. We'd love to see more knee bend, more him getting lower. He's kind of just standing straight up, falling back on his left foot. Here, the shooter is shooting a 15-footer from the foul line area. In the ego view, you can see a beautiful extension of the shooting arm, which is the right arm. You've got an extended elbow. You've got a breaking of the wrist. You can start to see those fingers pointing down. The guide hand, not too bad. I'd like to see that elbow come in a little bit and get more parallel, the forearm parallel to the floor. You don't want the elbow sticking out, but not bad. He's got great lift and elevation. I would like to see him maybe get off the floor a little bit more. He does a lot of his takeoff off the left foot. The right foot is just kind of up in the air, but a lot of his lifting and push-off is coming from just one foot, the left foot, and also on the landing. The beautiful extension here of the arms. Again, you know, take off the left foot, landing on the left foot, his center of gravity is back. You can see him kind of fading here. Let's really hold this follow-through and extend that right elbow. Pretty good breaking of the wrists there on that follow-through. Again, you can just see the push-off of the left foot. Not a lot of push-off here of the right foot. Would love that to be more equally distributed. But beautiful extension here. Let's get that guide hand with a palm facing in more and get that elbow in. But this is nice. He's got a pretty good, you know, releases the ball at the height of his jump. Again, you could see him, he just pushes off that left foot. He doesn't get a lot of push off with the right. So again, I'd love to see more of us being ready and stepping into this pass left, right, and equally distributing your weight on both feet to go up off the air. But again, pretty good extension here, may have short armed it just a tad here by pulling that elbow back, but beautiful breaking of the wrist on the follow through.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He's going off the right foot or the correct foot with the left foot and he's extending high with his right hand. It's great. I'd give him a nine. He missed one.

He's got a shooting hand behind the ball. The guide hand comes off, but it's still there. See it in the picture. And again, it's just offering a line of protection between the ball and a potential defender. That defender is gonna have to come across him to get the ball. And that's tough to do without fouling. So great job there. Look how he steps on that left foot, uses it to square, he's starting to square his hips and body to the basket. Lifts it with two hands, with the shooting hand behind, the guide hand on the side. That guide hand starts to come off. Eyes and head are up. Nice job. Again, lands with his knees bent on two feet, more balance, stability here. His eyes and head, he's still seeing the ball into the basket. Again, great push off of the left foot, right knee raises. You know, he's in a really good position here. Look how he's got that guide hand, that left hand, just on the side for support as he raises it from the ground up to where he wants to release it. Beautiful push off of the left foot. That's the correct foot for this drill. Lifting of that right knee, which powers and extends the body up. Great look here with two hands. That guide hand is there. Just some token pressure, but it comes off as you prepare to release it from your right hand. Good landing, staggered stance, knees are bent, head and eyes are up. Great use of the backboard. Look how he squares his body. You know, that left foot, the footwork has so much to do with getting your body ready. So the left foot pushes off, the right knee goes up, comes down, arm bars up, beautiful extension of the shooting arm. And there's the lift of the right knee. But look how that left foot helps him pivot and square his body. He still has two hands on the ball. That guide hand or non-shooting hand is on the left. He's got his shooting hand behind the ball. Eyes and head are up. Look at this stride here. He's covering distance. Big old step, stepping off that left foot. That left foot then is gonna almost become a pivot foot where it helps square his whole body to the basket. Two hands on the ball, better control. It's just a strong basketball position. Again, his shoulders are square, his body, he's not shooting sideways, he uses his feet to help square his body so that he's facing his target. Nice job there. Look at the look at the ball come off those finger tips. Nice job. Great look here at a reverse right hand layup. Love the push off of the left foot on that right side. The pulling of the right leg and knee up as you extend your body to shoot it. I love how he's got two hands on the ball. That right hand shooting hand is behind it. His guide hand is on the side. In this picture you can start to see the guide hand come off as he prepares for the shot. His eyes and head are up. His body is in a really good relationship to the backboard so that he can use it to finish the shot. Here it is. You know, I would probably bring the ball in a little bit tighter. He took that dribble and he's kind of stuck it out here. Again, a defender could steal that. So let's, you know, dribble. Let's keep it in a little bit tighter to our body. But great footwork, good distance between the feet as he pulls the right leg in. Great footwork, spacing, that move sets up this shot, eyes and head are up, two hands on the ball, he knows where he is because he's looking up. There's the release. Beautiful extension here of the right shooting arm, snapping of the wrist. His target is the top of that square. Beautiful extension here. Push off looks really, really good. I love how he used this one dribble move. He dribbled it with his right hand right out in front of him, quickly lets it take him to the basket. So now he's ready to, off this right hand dribble, to step with this left foot. Look how he's looking up. He's got two hands on the ball. He knows what he wants, where he needs to go. Again, here's a great look in the same shot of that guide hand coming off. But look how it's still there. It's at 90 degree. There's a defender. He's got his body between the defense and the basketball. You can see it right there. Great job.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

It should actually be, I want to say, in opposition there. So the dancer is moving the body back to the front, rocking it with the arms. It should actually be in opposition of one another there in that movement. The dancer needs a lot more isolation here between the lower part of the body and the upper part. Again, controlling those arms would be nice for the dancer's movement. Placing the elbow out a little bit away from the body would also be more clear. And again, we wanna see a little bit more dimensionality, more variety between the lower part of the body here and the upper part of the body where they meet in the waist and the hips in that area. The dancer does a good job in terms of the sequen-tionality or the sequence of the movement and is aware of the choreography, but it's the execution where we want to see more consistency with the movement, more energy, more fluidity in moving throughout the dance, throughout the whole body. That should be more strong. There should be stronger intentionality behind that. So that step with that shift in the ankle and that step out on the right, the dancer's got to step out far more to start that movement with that energy. Okay, and the dancer's arm really should be more strongly extended from the shoulder. Dancer is losing a lot of energy. The movement is fizzling down a bit here. The dancer loses a little bit of energy here, so we want to see energy consistent and throughout. The dancer's movement there with that body roll should really be initiated more with the head and then goes into the neck, the rest of the body. The dancer does attempt to achieve this and ends up doing it twice almost because it was so fast because it was just the top part of the body which stopped here.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And to have more energy throughout. Start out with great energy. Be consistent with the energy. The dancer does a great job coordinating the steps to the left and the right, but I believe the movement is for the dancer to push out with the hand on both sides, and the dancer is giving more of a cupping of the hands towards the sky. So that's beautifully executed, but I'm not sure if that's supposed to be the choreography or the pressing out with the hands. Dancer does a great job bringing those arms around.

Assuming that it wasn't used in assisting him to actually shoot the ball. As you can see he kind of shot off of his left ring and pinky finger which shows inconsistencies whereas he shot the ball early off his pointed finger and his middle finger. So just being consistent on which finger the ball actually rolled off of will help you tremendously in being able to make shots over and over. Right here, it says statue is straight up, follow through is down there, the other follow through is down there. We want to make sure that follow through stays up and that guy hand is short, the shooting hand is long. Right here, first thing I see is covering up the target. You want to make sure that ball is either shifted to the right or coming over the top, seeing as if he's potentially a right-hand shooter. Right here I could see that he does not have shoulder width apart spacing and if it's free throw normally one foot would slightly be ahead of the other. Assuming he's a lefty, that left foot is probably designed to be ahead of the right just a tad versus both feet being side by side and closely aligned. Yeah, right here it shows these two fingers are pointing towards the ball. The offhand is here. So assuming he's lefty, but then again, he's covering up his vision, which indicates that he can shift it to the right or brought over the top on the left.

Not sure if that was in the Written in the music but Being able to clear the sound before the shift would be good there to avoid a glissando Even though the glissando was pleasing to hear The musician continues to play with really nice placement of fingers to get a clear sound. Not a clean shift for that melody note here. really fluid fingers here. Every note is speaking very clearly and that means he's got a good acquisition of all notes on the fret. This bar in that first finger is really hard to get clear for all of those notes there and it's really good. Right hand does a really good job plucking with evenness and equal weight between the fingers so that not one finger sounds louder or stronger than the other. It's very pleasing to listen to. The correct fingering was played here for that second finger as opposed to the first time. Didn't speak here because his finger wasn't pushed down enough by the time he got to the note. His left hand is well practiced. Very few notes are missed and the curvature of his fingers stays very consistent throughout every single stroke and chord change. This is a well-practiced musician. Masterful use of lower bass notes playing quickly while other fingers sneak across to play a melody note on top. Very highly skilled. Really nice improvisation moment for this musician to play through that melody with all the added extra notes There's really good moments of consistent rhythm. But we miss it sometimes when there's a slightly more difficult scale pattern or run that gets in the way of the other main groove. I want to feel that groove the whole time, even if it's a displaced part of the groove. I still want to feel like I'm able to move to the groove the whole time and I'm not getting that here. I feel like the fast notes in this movement are fast just for the sake of being fast without much direction. I'm not sure how they connect to the chordal sections. I just feel that there could be a little bit more direction within those fast notes to progress us through the next set of chords that he's going to play for us. harmonics weren't as clearly spoken as they could have been here. Another example of using a first finger instead of a second finger for that scale down. He makes it work, but it's not the best fingering. Another first finger choice here instead of a second finger. A little bit of rubato here, I'm losing sense of tempo. Position also looks really good. Classical style of positioning with the foot pedal on the left foot and instrument at a pretty steep angle up the body, allowing for the fingers and hands to be in a really good position. My one suggestion so far is I'm not hearing a lot of dynamic changes. It's just a lot of the same kind of a sound. And I'm not sure what direction the melody is supposed to be going. Are we increasing to a climax? Or are we getting away from a climax? I just like to hear more direction in the phrasing. Much better use of that third fret second fret shift to second first fret without a glissando there. I like that one much better I actually thought that was a lot more convincing here. I could actually hear rubato and follow it, even though I lost the groove. He was able to bring the close of the phrase better because he measured it a little bit more clearly. We're getting a little bit of a Zing at the end of a note because he's lifting the finger up Too early from the fingerboard which causes the string to rattle against the fretboard Much better tempo here compared to the last time he played this section. I chose to play a first finger on the second fret rather than a second finger, maybe because this finger is stretched out all the way, curving this one in isn't as effective, but I would still advise the student practice getting that second finger there instead of the first finger. much better with the tempo and the groove. Really good placement and chord switching here with fingers going close to the frets and the fingers being agile enough to switch between chords quickly.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This is a great attempt at attack Annie. I would encourage the dancer to send those hips back pressing Pressing the top of the body the torso more down to the ground and bending those legs even further So they have a smaller Smaller area they needed to work from from their distance of their basically their head to the ground There they would have less distance They would have to cover which would make the attack Annie easier to accomplish It's hard to accomplish an attack Annie when you're standing up Very very straight and the back is erect So this would improve the overall technique of this movement That spin was really good. I would encourage them to spot while they spin a little bit quicker, but also to make sure that throughout the entire dance, they have a little bit more precision. So thinking about where their feet should be, where their hips should be, how far they should be bent over, what should they be doing with their legs, especially what should they be doing with the shoulders because they tend, this dancer in all their videos tends to hunch over a little bit, and thinking about the placement of the neck and the head. And all of these qualities working together, the precision and articulation of each of the body parts would improve the overall proficiency of this choreography dramatically. I would encourage the dancers to have more hustle and attack here so they can stay on the rhythm. And overall they can improve the overall energetic quality and dynamic quality of the dance. I would encourage the dancers to roll their shoulders up back and out because they're kind of hunched over right now. So it would give them more presence and dynamic quality throughout the dance. Here I repeat my comments about being off of the beat and making sure they do that homework to learn the rhythm. Through this whole section when the dancer kind of bounces back and forth throughout the floor is a moment if they were more grounded they could use their hips to be able to more effectively sway back and forth, which would improve the technique of the dance. Because they're doing a shim-sham-shimmy for this, they should definitely be on the balls of their feet and send their weight down and open up their legs so they can kind of pivot, kind of swing on this pendulum back and forth for the shim-sham-shimmy. And then they can be able to more efficiently kick that leg over. Do you like my diagram? They'll be able to kick that leg over. So they'll go moving those hips back and forth for the shim-sham-shimmy on the balls of the feet and then be able to more efficiently have a great range of motion to be able to kick that leg over.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She's able to apply that pressure down straight through that foothold. And now the left foot is kind of smearing into the wall, staying tensioned. And that's going to let her kind of push herself up to the hold. Again, it does a good job walking the feet through, but again, this non-tensioned foot is just loose and flopping around. It's actually kind of pulling her away from the wall. She's trying to do these moves. So overall staring off pretty good, keeping the arms nice and straight, kind of staying opposite pose, but has a tendency to kind of let their other foot drop off the wall. So like she's towing it with her left foot really good, but this right foot is kind of just hanging loosely off. That's actually kind of pulling her hips away from the wall. So ideally she could kind of tighten that in, flag it, put it on another hold, smear it into the wall, and let that kind of assist her drive upwards. Again, we can see that just how, you know, she drops that right foot again and just is flopping out so far from the wall. And it's just really getting her hips up from the wall and having her kind of compensate with the upper body. Here we can see just how far it's pulling her out. It's just yanking her hips off the wall. So she doesn't have to fight all that to bring herself into the wall again.

So the dancer starts with a salsa just stepping forward and back. She's coming in with a really nice energy, just getting her body moving and getting ready for the step. Her knees are bent and she is stepping forward on that leg and rotating her arms around and her eyes are looking forward and out to the audience.

Um, unfortunately I don't know what hand is next because he doesn't make it to it. Now here it's maybe he's supposed to do a different move because he attempts to kind of use the top part of this hold which kind of has a slope and down edge so he's not able to grab it so he tries to match it which is kind of putting his hands on top of his hands already. So it looks like maybe he's not quite sure or confident in what the next moves are going to be and where he should go and what he should be doing. So maybe this was his flash burn and as he gets more tries in deep he'll kind of figure out the moves a little bit better. He has a fairly good starting position, arms are nice and straight, kind of engaged. Especially on this right arm where it's a little bit more pinchy. He's a little bit more bent and a little bit more actively gripping on this as he's going to move up with his left hand first. So overall, nice starting position, maintains some good power and tension through it. Doesn't really relax on the one arm because I think he needs to be a little bit more actively engaged to really engage with that pinch and pull through that pinch. So you can see he's in the process of kind of maybe swapping the feet but he does bring his left foot up high Which is kind of a problem because his left hand is below so he's kind of in a barn door position He's gonna have to move his right hand first. So when he does that he's gonna kind of be His whole body's gonna kind of want to rotate out So maybe not the most ideal situation but you can kind of swap it and do a backflip to put right foot on kind of get this kind of tension foot out here Should kind of make it easier to do the next couple moves And here for this move he kind of comes up he hits this kind of Waco style hold That looks pretty positive he kind of Changes his grip around on it, but it settles on this kind of open hand grip You can see once he kind of finds that kind of optimal spot He then straightens his arms his arm is nice and straight and he kind of shifts his whole body To the left to kind of be hanging underneath it and not to fight it And then once he's in this position he kind of goes to readjust and keep tension on his feet", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The bowl is pretty small, so for her to whisk and get some air in there, it would be difficult, especially since she's using a spoon. If she were using a fork, this might be a little easier. Here she adds a little bit more oil to the edges. It's not necessary, but if it makes her feel better, I guess it's fine. It's something you should oil correctly the first go around. and taking her spoon to crack her egg. She moves to an alternative burner to get her stove back lit, but her pan was well heated because you can hear it still cooking as it's set to the side. Now she drizzles a little bit of oil in there. Because the pan is larger in diameter than the amount of eggs, she doesn't get a nice circle, but she is spreading out the egg that's uncooked. It's sitting on top with the back of her spoon. She's adding another spice which could be a curry or a masala blend. Now she's making cross cuts there to make sure that it's the same cut size as the onion. Here she's beginning to test the edges of her omelet with her spatula just to make sure they're not sticking. And you can see from these white areas that her egg wasn't fully incorporated because that would be egg white specific cooking. And this is cooking quickly, which is normal for warm pans. And we're almost ready. She's lighting the stove on her gas stove top. She's added that onion to the bowl with her spices. Now she's making smaller cuts to result in a small dice. She's adding some oil to her pan now. She's adding some turmeric to her small bowl. Her pepper's been added to her bowl with onion and spices. Her omelet's quite thin, she has to be pretty careful. And now she has a long metal spatula. She's having to more stir it and move it. And adding a pan, it looks to be a cast iron, flat bottom with very low slope sides. And you can see it does break a little as she flips it.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He's kind of hooking it, if you will, and you can kind of see how he shoots over his body instead of getting that shooting hand behind the ball and having more of a direct path here. But not bad. He definitely has his eyes and head up and he's aiming for that square. Lands on two feet, seems really balanced, maybe bend the knees and drop the hips a little bit. But again, it kind of shoots around and you can see that shooting elbow out. We'd like it to be in and under the ball, but the ball does come off these fingers, which is really good here. Again, I would square this right shoulder up a little bit. You can see here barely, but he's kind of hooking it. So he's got a really long distance to go here. Instead of squaring that right shoulder up and getting that shooting hand a little bit more behind the ball. And have it shoot it more in front of you instead of out from you.  Here he then follows with the left step, again gathers it off the dribble, puts it in two hands, eyes and head are up. Again, I really feel like his movement, that dribble, those steps, could definitely be more aggressive so that he could explode and lift his body up into his shot. You know, just be more aggressive overall. I think he really has the skill level to do that. He lands softly on the... when he comes down. Not a lot of room to come down, but he does do a good job of seeing the ball into the basket. Eyes and head are up. Here, again, good footwork. He does end up on his left foot, gonna bring his right leg up, eyes and head are up, two hands on the ball as he lifts it up for the shot. Great footwork. Again, would love for these steps to be just more direct and more aggressive so that he can really lift his body up. Nothing wrong with what he's doing, but in a game situation, you've got to be really strong and aggressive, and all your movements need to be explosive. Here, again, he's, you know, I love that he would square this right shoulder here and shoot more out in front of him. He's kind of hooking it up. You could see the arm going out, the elbow out. But I like how he, you know, his release, it's come, he's got his fingers spread. He's definitely got control of the ball. So nothing terrible with that. Just to be more accurate, you want to bring it in a little tighter. Love the lift and elevation. Way to keep that arm bar up there. Nice job. Again, here he's kind of hooking it up. But again, nice lift here in elevation. He's just a natural athlete, but I think he could explode even more up if that dribble would take him to the basket more aggressively. Here you can see the follow through. He does kind of bring it around, if you will. I love the arm to be a little bit more straighter and direct. You know, he probably kind of hooked it up there, if you will. But great extension of the body, great placement of the ball on the backboard. Again, would love for him to be, you know, attack this basket more aggressively. Let's get the elbow in, have more of a follow-through extended elbow. Here the elbow's out because he's kind of hooking it up to the backboard. He's making the shot, which is good, but to take it to another level, to be more consistent, and to keep it, your body between the defender and the ball, you've got to put your body there. Here, the shooter's attempting a reverse right-hand layup, uses the dribble to set up the movement from left to right. Beautiful stride here, nice long step on the left foot. You can start to see that the foot kind of pivot in as it lands to face more of the basket. Here you start to see the right leg and knee follow. And I love how his eyes and head are up and off the dribble he puts two hands on the ball to try to bring it up to the point of release. Again, same thing here. Kind of got his hand under the ball. Let's square this right shoulder up more. But love, he's got some lift here. That's a lot better. And good arm bar bent there to act as a barrier between the ball and the defender. Again, let's be more explosive, really push off that left foot and lift the body up. He's in a really good angle here to use the backboard, eyes and head are up, two hands on the ball, and you can start to see that guide hand come off, which is what you want to see happen. And again, great footwork, great lifting of the right knee. The guide hand comes off and now it becomes, I call it an arm bar. If that's a defender, he's got his body between the defender and the ball. Great lifting of the ball for the shot. Again, love this movement here. Nice big step with the left foot followed by the right. I like the spacing he has underneath his feet. Let's get this ball up quickly. He does bring his left hand guide hand here on the ball. And I love that he knows where he is on the court. He knows where he is in relation to the basket because his eyes and head are up on the basket. uses a dribble to get himself to the basket. You know, the thing I would say with this young man is, let's have a more of explosive one dribble move. And it's okay, and I probably would be dribbling with my left hand, that dribble to my, here you've got more defenders here, but it's okay. I mean, if he feels more comfortable with his right hand, I probably would dribble it out with my left hand. And you want that dribble to be out in front of you, and he's kind of dribbling it right here beside him. So he's stepping right, and then possibly stepping left here. I love that he's not looking at the ball when he dribbles, his eyes and head are up. Here, great footwork, take off of the left foot, pulling the right knee up. He lifts the ball to his point of release with both hands and his eyes and head are on the ball.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I would encourage this dancer to really have more power through their arms and let it emulate from the back all the way to the fingertips. I would encourage the dancer to roll their shoulders forward, up and back. That makes them look more relaxed and kind of gives this element of cool to this advanced choreography. This dancer is moving super fast, so I would encourage them to spot everywhere they go so they are landing very precise. I repeat my previous comments about making sure those hips are engaged. I would encourage the dancer to move their rib cage as well as their hips their entire dance so it doesn't look like they're just moving more robotically because right now it just looks like they're moving their arms and their legs really really fast and their head really really fast but by engaging the core and the hips and the torso it creates fluidity throughout the movement.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He is able to kind of minimize that movement in his upper body and bring clarity to the arm choreography, as well as move his legs quickly and efficiently in a way that helps him embody the rhythm. As the dancer begins with a basic salsa step, step touching his feet side to side. He's got a very small movement happening in his feet and lower body and quite a lot of movement happening, particularly in the shoulders and through the arms. While I appreciate that he's able to incorporate arm choreography as well as leg choreography, his energy feels unevenly dispersed here. He needs to minimize the energy that he's putting into his upper body and bring that down to his lower body so that he is able to evenly embody the rhythm and pay attention to his movement dynamic here. As the dancer moves through a series of turns, he effectively uses his head to spot the front, which helps him to move quickly and efficiently, and he also maintains a nice bend in his knees as he's making this pivot turn happen, which helps him to stay grounded and move through the turn quickly and efficiently. As the dancer continues in this movement, he's able to locomote a little bit more through the room with clarity, particularly in his lower body. However, his upper body is still moving in a way that's distracting and throwing him off the rhythm. His shoulders have this kind of up-and-down bouncing quality to them, which doesn't quite align with the tempo or the rhythm of the music, and he's moving his arms in a fairly big manner, which is also throwing him off from the fast tempo of the music. If you were to minimize and refine the movement in his upper body, he would improve his performance.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And that's because he was keeping a firm frame between fingers 1 and 3, and then he was using his wrist and arm to then press that frame down onto the keys, and so that made it very consistent and balanced. That's well done. We need to hear all those notes in the arpeggio that was just played with both hands coming up, so just making sure that you're fully depressing the key as you're going up for every single note. Definitely some slow practice or perhaps performing at a slightly slower tempo so you have time to really get every note down. We're missing in between, in the right hand, in between these thirds that are being played, the single note in between the thirds we're not quite hearing. So just has to make sure that we don't skip over that cause that is really important both harmonically, but also for the rhythm to get the character of the rhythm. So just make sure that those notes speak. These repeated notes, the repeated D's that were just played first with finger 2 and now with finger 4, we're just not hearing them as separate notes, so we need to just have a little bit larger of a finger movement so that the key really has space to go up and down so we can really hear them. We need a little bit of a decrescendo on that descending line on the right hand. So the highest note should be the loudest, and it should decrease in volume to the lower note. We need a lot more right hand here, especially when you're competing with playing forte on low notes on the piano like he is on the left hand. We really need these high notes up here to be longer and louder, because they just don't have the same resonance as the low notes. We can see here that the pianist has completely outstretched fingers and a completely flat hand, and we can see that his fingers are basically touching the headboard of the piano. This is one of the reasons why we're not hearing enough of the right hand here, because when you're playing that far up on a black key, the lever is at its most tense point and it's hard to press down. So if he would curl his fingers a bit more and let them hang from his hand, he would then inherently be further down the black key where he would get more power out of each stroke and then we would hear more of the right hand here. Good dynamic balance between the hands right here. It's not too loud overall, which is good for a ballad like this, but we can really hear both hands clearly dynamic-wise, so it's well done. We need more clarity on these notes here, even though the pedal is down. Don't stay on the notes quite as long and give us a little bit more of a snappier finger action so we can really hear these notes. Otherwise it just ends up being what we just heard, which was just kind of a muddy sound. We need to hear more of the right hand here. Pernice is doing a great job of bringing out the higher notes in this melody in the right hand. They're kind of, musically they're sort of accented and he's accentuating that by playing them louder, so that's a nice choice. It's well done. We're hearing that the left hand is coming out very clear and very consistent and with great rhythm here. And that's because he's playing with a really nice curve to these fingers, a little bit of bend in the wrist, but generally a straight wrist. And that's allowing him to be very nimble and very controlling in that area of the piano. So that's really well done. A big lack of clarity in that riff coming from the top of the piano down to the bottom of the piano. A lot of that was because the fingers weren't curved enough, but it was also just partially coordination and not having up to speed. So we really need to hear all those notes in that fast lick. Really great soft touch here. We're hearing all the melodic notes in the right hand come with the same articulation and the same volume, so it's really well done. Left hand is really overpowering the right hand here in terms of volume, so the left hand volume is actually appropriate, we just need the right hand to be stronger here, so a little bit heavier of a touch. Excellent rhythm in this, especially right here, but for about the past minute, the rhythm has been very stable, and he's keeping the groove alive very well. So that's great. That's well done. We need a little bit less left hand here. It's overpowering the melody in the right hand On these quick and repeating B flats being played with the right hand and the second finger, we're not quite hearing all of those notes. You can tell by looking at the right hand what the rhythm is supposed to be, but we don't actually hear all of those B flats speak. Because they're quick, we need to actually have a slightly larger motion so that we can allow the key to come all the way back up, so we can press it back down all the way. What's happening is he's not allowing the key to come fully up, so he's not able to press it back down again. So a larger motion and a little bit more from the wrist would help with this, or an alternating two and three fingering on that B flat will help get us the clarity and actually hear all the notes in this rhythm. In this figure being played with fingers 2, 3, 4, we're not really hearing the note being played with finger 3, so we just need to make sure that that has a little bit snappier of a finger action so that we can really hear that 3-note gesture. We hear in these last two measures both times that the left hand has to shift from around here to further down on the piano. We have a small break in the rhythm because the pianist is not trusting his shift. So he either has to play this at a slower tempo where he can make that shift without halting the pulse of the music, or he needs to just commit to that shift and get his hand down there quicker so that we don't lose the rhythm. We lost that rhythm a little bit in the right hand. This is because there's some tension in the right hand. We can really see that through these tendons that are popping up here. And that tension makes it more difficult for the fingers to move, therefore more difficult for the fingers to be controlled. So actually having a looser right hand will allow the pianist to play faster and more controlled. In the left hand we need to hear more of the higher octave in this alternating octave pattern. If we don't hear enough of that high octave, we can't quite feel the character and the structure of this rhythm. So it just needs to bring out that first finger in the left hand a little bit more.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Big distance between the feet here. It's going to have a knock-on effect to the balance in the next touch. And then just to touch on the stance, we can see the hop here, the foot is planted heavy, causing the momentum to go forward in the upper body here. You can see the head, completely horizontal, spine very bent over, standing leg kind of straight. So again this is caused by the jump in the plant, leg coming out straight here to try to scoop the ball in before it gets beyond its target here. So what we would want to see would be the head somewhere along here, spine pretty much straight up, and then we want to see standing leg nice and bent in close to the ball, and then our right leg coming out, also with a little bit of a bend in it, and we're taking that touch in this direction, and it's followed up by just some short quick steps. One, two, three, ball is over here, and then it's just the opposite of this, where the left foot is out a little bit wider, and we're down nice and low with the knees, trying to keep our body upright so we can see what's out in front, not looking down too much, focusing on the ball and not seeing what's ahead. And again getting to this point it can look like it was pretty fluid Whatever the weave was it was I knew the other direction So it came up here and around Again can look pretty fluid but if we slow it down and we watch where the steps are being taken and The habits between the steps we can see that the technique here is Not very great Fundamentally just incorrect off balance a lot of jumping and shuffling and Needs to be fixed up a little bit Player takes a small hop on this left foot. Ideally again left foot comes across and lands here. We allow the ball to get into this area. Right foot takes a touch on the outside and both feet are stood here. So not getting this foot into the right positions with the right methods. We are jumping too much, planting too much, not light on the feet. Again it should be three steps and we go with the opposite. So right foot touch, we go left, right, left foot step and then we go with the opposite side. Here again, just seeing airborne players hovering this direction. Again, talking about three steps. Let's just simply get to this point to follow the ball while being nice and light and agile on the feet to get the touch on the ball here, to bring it through here. Same idea, three steps, hit or touch, coming across this way, one, two, three steps, right foot comes out here, and we're around. This player seems to be mixing it up. Couple of jumps here, couple of plants, couple of shuffles, couple of skips, maybe two steps. So we're just after seeing a quick shuffle of feet here and here, which can see the player allowing the ball to get past this point to this area where we want it to go. And they get an okay touch with the inside of the left foot across into this space. But what we're going to see next is this foot kind of staying planted in the ground and a big stretch of the right foot and a big stance. We're going to see this distance between both feet. It's quite a big stance where maybe what we could have seen would have been this foot being planted, a quick step with the right foot here, a quick step with the left foot here and then the right foot getting close to the ball where now we have a stance this distance apart. And it would have been because of the extra one, two, three steps here. So again, just following up from the last point, talking about the inside foot not being able to move forward until the ball has come past this line so they can step forward without kicking the ball. We see here that the player has actually taken a bit of a hop here. They wanted to bring this leg and foot forward, but they've hesitated because this ball has not moved fast enough in this direction and they can't bring this foot forward. So they're taking a hop which is affecting their balance and their stance and they're going to get stuck in the mud before their next touch where they can't really get across. So if the ball is going to end up here, they can't really get their left foot across to this point to then maneuver their right foot into this position and take a touch this way. So again, standing foot position, much closer to the ball before it is being moved across the standing foot. From here, player moving much more fluid, taking two steps because after the first touch, they are bringing their standing foot much closer to the ball to get it across here. Once again, they get it across here. Right foot will come inside a little bit. We'll get a left foot over here, taking a touch to stop the ball. Right foot then gets closer and left foot comes through here. So again, just the standing foot is the key here, getting that close to the ball to be able to kind of create an axis to lean over on. Again, once the standing foot is here, we're creating that axis to lean on again and move side to side, not being overstretched and off balance. So here again just an example of a touch and a plant. Right foot has touched the ball and planted heavy after the touch and we'll see the knock-on effect this will have. Here just a case in point, the player has actually stepped heavy with the left. They've jumped up. We can see airborne this foot in the air. Player up in the air. They're jumping across this direction to try to be planted somewhere here with their left foot to take the touch with their right foot. They're trying to redirect that ball in this direction. Instead of the jump up here to here, maybe being off balance, they will get there and they'll be able to take that touch. We talk about three steps in between. They could have taken the touch towards here. Left foot comes down, right foot comes down, left foot comes down and then right foot takes a touch in this direction. Instead of this jump here where we're airborne, putting a lot of energy into the jump, planting in this spot, we should be going one, two, three steps, touch. And then it's the same thing if we're continuing to move forward. This one is a turn so it's going to be some sort of a hook around the corner, whatever the preference is. And again just another example here of hovering in the air to try to get over to make contact with the ball before it's too late, caused again by a planted step right after a touch. And it's this action of this foot coming across To step closer to the ball That's going to cause the next touch To be good. So again, we talk about Bringing the feet closer. It always comes back to bringing the feet close If it's touchstep dribbling ahead, it's getting the foot in close to the ball So we can set our body up with good balance if it's weaving left to right It's getting our foot close to the ball before we take our touch so common theme stepping in close to the ball To again set our balance straight or to slightly lean into the touch depending on what direction we wanted to go Here we just see how the balance is going to affect our touches in the future. So the ball is being touched with the left foot as we can see here. And here, notice how far over the centre of the screen is. So the player is looking almost back towards the ball. And if we look here, foot planted, head here. So our balance way off. Out in front. And as we see in the next touch, the player is going to end up stepping on the ball to try to stabilise themselves. Again, caused from habits of not taking small steps between touches and trying to be agile. So without the player probably noticing this, they actually took 3 steps here So it's one step here, another step here and then the right foot stepped here after The touch that was in this direction and as we can see The ball is in a better position to be touched Through in this direction here I think they follow up here with another 3 steps also And they manage to navigate the ball pretty smoothly Between these areas here using many more light steps in between And having a little bit more patience whilst following the ball So we see the effects that over stretching can have here. The ball kind of gets stuck because of the width of the stance. Left foot here, right foot here, extremely wide. When the touch comes towards the ball, weight also comes down on the ball. So we can see this leg here is slanted, putting force down on the ball, ultimately causing the ball to get stuck under the foot and to cause a bit of a stumble. If again this foot comes all the way over here and is somewhere along here, that weight is leaning across this axis here and this touch is much more smooth. So here again we see the right foot planted in this space here, this space here. Zero steps between the touch from the right foot and this touch here that is happening with the left foot. So generally if I'm doing this exercise with a player I will always tell them to take three steps in between. So we will go one touch with the right. The left foot would be stepping, the right foot would come across the left foot. And now the left foot will go back outside to take a touch somewhere just across this line to move the ball in this direction. So when the left foot is touching the ball here, the right foot is close by. From there we would go right foot down, left foot here, right foot taking a touch. Around here with the left foot close by. So we now have that kind of pivot point for our body to swing over. Take that touch with the right and then we bring the right foot across. And the trend develops that way. So three steps in between. This player here is taking zero steps in between two touches. And sometimes we're going to see maybe one, two steps in between where it's not getting the body set up to get a balanced touch through to the other side. Again starting off with a one touch Planted foot here and this left foot coming around to meet the ball Without any other steps being taken in between both touches. So again balance is off Not set up to move across in this direction on this next touch in the right way So again player just needs to take more steps in between So here, just again to show the off-balance habits that are creating these issues. Bulk of the weight here, head here, so it's a big lean forward, ball getting stuck under the feet, very heavy plant, and kind of a higher center of gravity. So again we want to see the center of gravity pulled back, lowered a little bit here, and us standing slightly behind the ball but close to it, legs slightly bent, body upright, head tilted not as low, we're here, we can lean in that direction and take a touch through the ball over here. In this exercise here we are looking at dribbling. It looks like the player is dribbling in a manner which is seeing them weave in and out through the cones and assuming back this way and back around at the top. So we will look at the same things as usual, how fluid the ball is moving through these cones, the different surfaces that the player is using of their foot, the technique involved, the stance they are using, the step in, centre of gravity, stuff like that. The speed of the ball, tempo of the touches, repetitive and challenging sequences if there are any, steps between the touches, how the steps are being taken, the distance that is being covered per second and then any creativity that the player may be exhibiting in this video. And again here, just the player again airborne. See the leg up here, this one kind of slanted back underneath. And the player's hovering across to try get themselves in the right position to use the inside of the foot through the gap. So just extra steps needed in between the touches. Not sure whether it's experience or habit, bit of both, lack of experience maybe, not sure. So this is one that I do with players and it's always touch, three steps in between minimum, touch, three steps in between minimum and the player staying close to the ball and eventually they get very controlled with this one. So this foot should kind of be here already. So right foot which is about here should be here when this touch is taken. This left foot can come across and in front and land somewhere here. Then right foot can come back to about this position. Left foot takes another step standing here and the right foot swings around to meet the ball somewhere around here. We take that touch there and it's through. But again feet just not being set in the right position. And if we're wondering why it looks more fluid and Looks like the player is a better dribbler When they're actually taking two touches either side So we've got two touches here two here Two here to get through and then this is our second touch here to bring it through this direction Why is this a successful touch? We look at the standing foot We can see ball touching foot Standing foot behind here. The player is leaning in this direction and Then they're following it up With probably an over stretched foot to stop the ball in this area But what is going to happen is if this is a right foot and they stop the ball with the impact They bring the left foot over here Kind of creating that line this axis here on which they're then leaning across and they're taking a second touch with the right foot in this direction while leaning over and Again the idea we talked about three steps is to get the feet closer together to take these touches to lean into them And That is why it looks better all of a sudden, but there are more touches being taken So it's obviously easier to do when we take more touches so more touches lower level and But also setting themselves up for success Just with the position of the feet being much closer Again, just following up from the last one, we can see the foot still planted from that last touch which took the ball over here. What would have helped again this player would have been if this right foot here had taken a quick shuffle step here, plant the left foot in front while lifting the right foot to then bring the right foot here to take that touch across. See, when we look at this exercise in 1x speed or above, we might think that the ball is moving pretty fluidly through, which there's an argument that it is, but then if you actually slow it down to 0.5 or 0.25, you will notice more how many inconsistencies there are with the technique here, and the stepping, the shuffling, the balance being off, and just many different types of jumps and off-balance touches that are behind the movement of that ball. So, you could again argue this ball is moving through fluidly, but talk about overall dribbling ability here, it's not quite a sustainable style of dribbling, a lot of erratic jumping just to get to the right positions, without kind of having the right foundation or fundamentals in the stepping, and why we are getting from one place to another, what manner, what way, what shape do we want to be in when we get there. And now that foot has come down, it's quite planted here. So that's the one that was bearing all the weight. We see the ball has not really cleared past this point yet. We want to get it into this space somewhere. So we can take that touch, clear the cone diagonally. It's not getting past, but the player has had to ground their feet. Their right foot, because they are off balance. They are stuck in the mud back here. Weight is now moving towards this way. They have had to ground prematurely because they are not moving their feet fast enough. And they are electing to use always the foot that is closer to the outside of the centre line. So they are using the left foot when it's on the left, and then they are using the right foot when it's on the right. So on the last weave We've kind of had the player resorting to taking two touches on each side Not sure if it's because they're Unsure of how to get over there on time Don't quite know the answer to get across which is just taking shorter faster steps whether there or whether they are lower on energy not sure but Yeah, not not as fluid and not as high quality Quality probably dropping if anything So early on, based on getting from here down to here and back and we're up to this point here we see that the player is electing to use the inside of their foot the most. We're seeing inside of the foot or on this side, inside here. The player is using that to move the ball kind of forward and or across. Maybe a touch forward, maybe a touch across with the inside. The obstacles that are going to get in the way here being the outside foot, not the outside of the foot, but the outside foot. So they're always using, if this is our right and this is our left, they're always using the outside foot to push across the body. When it gets here, we're going to inside foot, outside foot would be the right foot this time. They're using the right foot to get across the body here. What the obstacle is here is this foot wants to move and take a step, but they have to wait until the ball gets past this point before they can take that step forward, which is going to cause the player to have to pause in their stepping and potentially plant their feet and it's going to affect the fluidity in the ball, the speed. The stance, the balance, many things will be affected if they keep trying to use the inside of the foot and kind of remain in such an upright stance with no lowering of the center of gravity, no bending the hips here, no bending the knee. So we'll see how it plays out, but early signs of this one is going to be a bit sticky.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Seems very quick and easy. Well practiced. Great coordination between the hands. Really nice rubato moment and then good control over the dynamics to create more emphasis on the return of the melody here. It was really nice. I think overall the tempo is just a little too fast. The song efficacy kind of misses just a little bit, and I would love to hear more phrasing of the pop tune than he's capable at this speed. A little bit of weird rushing going on here. When he restarts the phrase, it's back to the normal tempo and he speeds up throughout the entire thing. Does a good job keeping his fingers curved and not collapsing. Still a really good tempo throughout. I'm getting a clear idea of the melodies that he is creating and Harmony is far enough apart. It's easy to just easy to distinguish Pretty solid tempo throughout. Nice stretch between the thumb and the first finger here and motion forward and back on the keys allows him to access the black and the white keys pretty effectively. The sitting position looks pretty good. Spine is nice and tall and the legs look like they're at a good angle to the floor. Excellent glissando down to an immediate chord. That was really impressive. Really nice come down phrasing wise really really intense and then it comes down really nicely here. He did a good job measuring that Pretty good tune, plays it pretty well, it's just a little too fast and convoluted between the two hands at times. managing very easily to get from the chords they need up here down to the bottom over here. You can just see the the fingernails are very prominent here that means he's playing with a pretty flat finger.

This is improper technique in the left hand over here. What we see is that the wrist is very dropped and we can see that the top of the palm is actually touching the keys. We never want that to happen. Even if we're playing notes that are seemingly easy, we wanna be prepared for anything. And so keeping our wrist straight with our arm is gonna be preferable there. And then also that's gonna give us the most control over the articulation, the sound of these notes. So bring that wrist up a little bit and that's gonna help a lot. A little bit more crescendo in the bass line here, the notes being played with the fifth finger of the left hand. A little bit more of a crescendo and decrescendo in this last gesture that was played in the right hand just for musical expression to make it more exciting. In the left hand, we have to hear a little bit more of the third that's being played of the three notes, so the middle note that's being played, just a little bit more so we can really get the harmony here. This figure that was just played, this slightly ornamental figure that was just played with the right hand, can be brought out a bit more. It has to be a bit more of an accented feeling as opposed to one long melodic line. So just bring that out a tad bit more. This is great positioning of the right hand. We see that the top of the hand is in line with the forearm. The fingers are naturally hanging down from the hand and there's plenty of room underneath the hand for the thumb to cross underneath it. So that's great positioning. Great technique. A little bit more decrescendo in the past five beats would be most musically appropriate. We need a little bit more articulation here So a little bit heavier of a touch But a little bit shorter of a note length if possible in the left hand just so the left hand doesn't ring and overpower the right The pianist is doing a really good job of keeping a stable pulse, even at a slow tempo with a melody that is rhythmically sparse. They're doing a very good job of keeping the pulse. It's well done. One great thing that we noticed with the left hand and these last couple beats that were played is that the left hand is barely coming off of the piano. It's staying very close to the piano. And this is what is allowing the pianist to play this difficult passage where there's a shift in every beat very smoothly because they're being very efficient about their movement. So it's very well done. Excellent balance between the right and left hand here. Also excellent sensitivity to touch here. She is getting a very warm and round sound out of the piano. It's very well done. We're hearing a little bit of a lack of coordination between fingers 1 and 3 in the left hand. We're hearing the finger 1 play the note slightly sooner than finger 3. So we just need to make sure that the frame that we have set up to play that chord is accurately set up so that both notes go down at the same time. This section right here that she's just beginning should be a lot softer. It's the same dynamic as the section that she just finished. We should make a contrasting musical statement here, so a little bit softer here. We like to see a little bit in the past three beats of the piano played, a little bit more of a crescendo just to bring out that moving bass line. The wearer is sitting slightly too far back from the piano. We see that the arm only has a little bit of bend in it here. We'd like to see just a tad bit more bend because in this position, if the pianist had to move to the top end or the bottom end of the piano, it would be pretty difficult because their arms would be very outstretched. So sit a little bit more leaning forward, a little bit more forward on the seat, a little bit more bend in the arm, and that's going to make a lot more of the piano available to you. Very well done with that lowest note just played with the left hand here. Excellent sensitive touch, just a very ethereal feeling created by that light touch of this low note. Well done. In the right hand here, we have a little bit of uncoordination in these thirds being played. We're missing a little bit of the bottom note of those thirds. So bring that out just a tiny bit so we can really hear the full harmony. Nice balance here between the left hand and the right hand. The right hand has the melody and the wearer is bringing that out and letting the left hand accompany. So that's well done.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here we have the Climber 1 move in on this boulder, and you can get a pretty good look at what this hold is like. It's basically shaped like a telephone, so it's like this. You can get all the way around it. This is the wall, which is kind of cool. It's also pretty fat, so you do have to pinch it. It's an interesting hold.

This is called flagging out and it transfers over the weight to the left foot being in place. However, when the climber pushes into that left foot towards the hold, not only gave him direction, but also when being pressed, it sends the climber's center of gravity away from the wall. So right now the climber is glancing down at the feet to perform a foot switch. The climber performs the next move by sending the right hand over the left hand, both with the hands on the same holder. This is called matching and places the hand not only above but mostly to try to pinch the inside of the hold, left side part of the lip. So the climber is using his thumb that's placed on the outside and the fingers on the inside to pinch onto the lip. While keeping the left foot out of space and towards the wall, not placing any footholds and instead has pressed down onto the right foot so that he can try to keep his center of gravity underneath his left hand grip to make it an easy transition out left. The climbers right foot had slipped off from the hold while adjusting the grip. This is potentially due to a lack of accuracy on the foot placement and a mix of the climber potentially not applying sufficient pressure onto the right foot when releasing some pressure of the grip to adjust it. If he was to attempt this again he needs to make sure that he keeps the flag forcefully to help with the pressure of the right foot being in place. As the climber had made the right foot placement, he is adjusting the right hand grip, jumping over the hand placement, his right foot has come out of place. This obviously will compromise the grips by overloading them and will be really hard for him to recover at this move. The climbers are starting at a two-hand hold start. For the right hand, he's applying a pinch grip as he places the fingers onto one side and the thumb onto the other. And for the application for it, he would have to squeeze onto the hold and pull it back. For the left hand and the other hand, he is sustaining to a very small hold, placing the finger pads over the hold. This is type of a knob-like that is shallow, so he is actually using the thumb onto the one side to close the grip. This type of grip is called a crimp, and in this case, this would be an open crimp because he places the finger onto the side. And in order to create pressure in sustaining it, the climber must keep the elbow close to the wall. The climbers are starting at a sit start, so he is placing right now the right foot at a higher stance, and as soon as he gets himself positioned to transfer over the weight to the feet and to the grips, he will then lift the left foot from the mat, and then the climb will start. The clamberhack lands down at the feet and applies a foot switching technique that's called the jump off jump on where he jumps off the left foot while the right foot is hovering over it and then jumps the right toe to be placed over the hold. This method of foot switching works but is also not the most accurate as it takes a fair bit of energy and if that foothold is small it would be hard to do this and this is a medium-sized hold. Before the climb we're glancing over to the next hold at reach. He has brought the left foot to be placed over the orange hold left side. He will use this to push it over to bring him over to the left side when performing the reach. The climbers first move out of the start as into this large pocket. As we can see, the climber places only a few fingers over the edge of the hold. As there is a hole inside of the hold that is sharp, the climber must place the fingers behind the edge of the hold. That's the only way that it seems to be positive. It was a good idea of the climber to keep the right hand on the hold as this one is a pinch and the climber can bring the elbow out comparatively from the crimp. That is a very limited hold to sustain. As we can see the climber's form, he had press on the right foot that gave him height. For balance, the move was done by the left foot which was out in space and brought towards the wall with the leg extended. This type of form is called flagging out. When the climber was going out for the reach, the climber sends the left foot over to the right side. This is to balance over his main areas of support and to bring the center of gravity close to the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The climber attempts to go up to this green pinch, but as the climber grabs it, they start to accelerate to the left. So in a sense, this pinch sort of takes the climber, is how we would say it, and they're just unable to control this.

If they were indeed turning in partner, they would have to have strength through their core and throughout their arm to be able to whip their partner around. Sometimes what dancers do is they actually just hold onto the finger while this imaginary person kind of twirls around them. But in order to do that, the partner has to have, or the stationary partner has to have, or the partner that's not turning has to have strength and power to be able to twirl the partner. So I would encourage them to really kind of be statuesque in their upper body while they're moving side to side in their lower body. I would encourage this dancer to have more attack in their movement. This would help them stay on the rhythm. Right now they're kind of lightly stepping while they're touching. Like it's like step, step, step, touch, step, step, step, touch. If they had more attack, it would allow them to stay on the rhythm, right? Because they can't get lost in the ebb and flow of the melody. They would have to be forced to be on the beat. That step, step, step, touch, step, step, step, touch. Really having attack in their movement and precision. Here I will repeat all my previous comments for this last chunk. I would encourage the dancer to study the music. Right now they're off of the rhythm, and which is causing them to not appear to have musicality. So really taking the time to study the rhythm and making sure they're on the beat is super important. I would encourage the dancer to think about what part of their foot they're turning on. Is it the ball of the foot? Is it the whole foot? Is it the heel of the foot? I'm going to assume it's the ball of the foot. So really stepping, like grinding into that ball of the foot to be able to turn on this axis is really important and will create a more seamless, smooth transition. I would encourage the dancer to stabilize their upper body. So thinking about splitting their body in half, right, from the crown of their head all the way down to their tailbone, splitting it and really holding space and holding that upper body torso still while they solidified the feet. And then as they get more advanced, they can start to incorporate the torso. Right now everything is kind of loosey-goosey and kind of just vibing while the feet are on the beat. And it messes up the musicality of this movement. So really holding stable and as they practice and get better at attacking and having musicality and being on beat in the feet, then they can slowly add in the shoulders and the head and the ribcage and then the hips. At this moment, the dancer has musicality and rhythm in their feet, like they're on the beat for the step, step, step, touch, step, step, step, touch, or step, touch, step, touch, right? But their shoulders and their head and their hips are not, or their arms are not on the beat. So having musicality from the tippy top of your head all the way to the soles of your feet are important. And just takes it to that, gives it more dynamic quality and really covers the basics of this salsa step.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The head sometimes is wandering this way or that way. And the dancer really could be looking out or at their partner. If the dancer had a partner in front of them and they were in unison and dancing in sync, they would be wanting to look at the partner in front of them. Greater clarity on where the steps are going for the dancer would be very helpful. And again, it almost seems like the dancer is wandering where the dancer's head is shifting here and back again. It's unclear what the dancer's choreography or their movement is specifically. Right here, you can see the dancer has the body going this way versus this way. So there needs to be a little bit more break and release in the hips and less breaking in the neck and the head. The head should be a little bit more connected to the shoulders here. Also, the dancer can step together. So if they step right, left, right, and they take that step way over left, right, left. So it feels like there's two sets of three steps, right, left, right, left, right, left, right. So right, left, right, left, right, left, versus them just stepping, stepping, stepping, stepping. We don't see a variation when the dancer goes from the right to the left. So we want to see isolation here in the waist and the hips, the feet and the upper body. We don't want to see this connected as one piece moving the same way. So if the dancer has the ability to isolate that rib cage and that upper torso, move it independently of the waist so we could see the hips versus the legs moving the hips, it should be the hips moving themselves and the waist moving itself.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And when his hips are the closest to the wall, then focus on jumping up and to the right. So it looks like he's got the height, jumping in properly, that if he combines the proper position with this power, he should be able to hit it.

I would encourage this dancer to keep practicing and really think about moving with more quickness so it can look at an advanced choreography level. Notice how their arms are moving as bicycles.

This was because the climber had engaged the right foot prematurely at the jump, destroying his center of gravity away from the wall. Here the climber is now committed and is executing the jump. He does this by pressing hard on the foot that was against the wall. And as we can see the leg is now extended because it's no longer touching the wall. The climber had to sprint out of this leg and soon placing weight onto the highest foot. As the climber is gaining height, once the chest meets the same height of where the hands are, the climber will have to commit into a forceful pull. This so that the climber can bring the chest towards the wall. That will help the climber to stay close to the wall and going in the direction where the hold is at reach. As we can see the climber continues to look at the hold to aim exactly at where he would go for the reach. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start. As we can see, they're both rounded, so with a hole inside, this is called a donut. And the climber places the hand in the inside of the hole and presses the thumb on the outside to create more force on the grip. As the climber has secured the grip, he then leans back on the holds and the climb will start until the climber places the feet on the wall, which he's already on that stance. The left foot is pressed against the wall and the right foot is placed on a hold that the climber is able to place the front, the toe box sole area against the surface of the hold as it sticks out and the climber is able to press comfortably on it. As we can see, the climber is glancing over to a hold that is at distance. This, the climber will have to commit to a dynamic move where he needs to jump in order to achieve it. This is called the dino. The climber needs to make sure that he brings his chest as close as he can to the wall when making the jump. This will help the climber bring his center of gravity close to the wall, which lays in the core and on the hips area. And once the climber needs to commit on pushing on the right foot, then he will be able to boost that with not pushing himself away from the wall. So the engagement of the boost on the right foot is important that it's done at the right time and not done prematurely. As we can see, it took the climber's center of gravity away from the wall and did not let the climber apply any gripping power when making the dyno. As the climber was gaining height, the climber then pressed on the right foot to boost the jump. And as pressing the foot, the climber now has pushed it earlier. As we can see, the climber's center of gravity is being taken away from the wall when at the reach. The climber was able to make the hand placement, and on this one, he's able to hold it on as a jug, where he's going for a pinch at the lip. By placing the thumb at the bottom of the hold, and the fingers are placed above. This is important that the climber, once reaching the hold, he creates a lot of pressure by pinching it. And as we can see, the climber is also sending the left hand to create more support when at the grip. As we can see, the climber is swinging left to right. This is so that the climber is able to build momentum right before committing to the jump. So, it's important that the climber during this time is continuing to look at the hold to make sure that he doesn't miss the area where he aims to make the placement of the hand when making the reach.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Players aim, it looks like it should be towards this corner, however the contact point on the foot is on the inside here. You can see the angle in which the ball is taken.

They could just slightly speed it up a little bit more so both the strings sound better. There's more resistance in the bow since they're playing two strings. The violist often plays at the tip for a lot of these sections. Sometimes it's appropriate, but during this section I feel like they could use more of their lower amount of bow closer to the frog. The reason I feel like they're not doing this is because they're not utilizing their upper arm. They can bring it closer to their body to help get closer to the frog. Again, whenever the violist is lifting up their fingers, they're getting really far away from the fingerboard. They can lift them up but still be closer without actually having them touch. This pulsating stroke that they're doing to the bow, they're doing a good job of using their first finger to kind of flex the stick so they're getting this pulse in the string without actually leaving the string. The violins could use their upper arm to bring closer to their body so that they could play more at the frog of the bow. The violins perform a trill where they are rapidly going between two notes in the left hand. These notes that they're playing are a bit out of tune. They can try playing with a tuner, or they can play these notes and play it with an open string to get more context about the intonation. Again, this section would sound a little bit better if they were closer to the frog. They would have more control from their hand and their arm. The violinist plays two strings at once to play this chord. These single notes that the spineless is playing could be a little bit more compact using less bow for them to stick out a little bit more. The violinist is using a lot of bow and playing this really nice legato stroke. The violinist is playing some more string crossings. I feel like they could be even more efficient and have clear string crossings if they make more use of opening up their elbow. So the string crossings come from just opening up the elbow as they're playing. Again, you can see how far the fingers are going away from the fingerboard. It's best, even if they're not playing them, to try to keep it as close as possible to be as efficient as possible. The violins is playing out in the tip of the bow for this section to get a lighter sound. To get more articulation out of each note though, they can pronate more with their right hand, putting more weight into their first finger into the bow. Again, this is another example where the violence is not utilizing this part of the bow. They're not bringing in their upper arm enough to be able to get close to that section. The violinist is performing some slurs where they're playing two notes in a row in the same bow. Again, their left hand, whenever they have a finger down, the lower finger is also always up. This will create more tension in the hand. It's best to have a more efficient hand that the fingers are always closer to the fingerboard. In the violinist's bow hold, you can see that their thumb is very straight here. They should overall have a very curved thumb with a very soft touch contact with the frog. These repeated notes that they're playing on the bow sound pretty good, but I think it could be better if they were just a little bit further down to the frog. Again, they're doing this trill in the left hand with repeated fast notes between two fingers. The violins perform some string crossings very well, moving from one string to another. The violinist is using a small amount of bow and not much weight to create this very light sound. The violinist is getting some really nice clarity in the left hand because they're playing with their fingertip and using a nice amount of speed to get into the string. When playing with their left hand, you can see that their fingers are getting really high up off the string. To be the most efficient, they should try to keep them as close to the string as possible.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It's aggressive, it's explosive. Not little teeny little steps. Great vision here. Two hands on the ball as he pulls the shot up. Again, same thing here, big step here with the left foot. He actually is not dribbling at all. He's just choosing, and this is how I would really want people to learn how to shoot. It's just no dribble. Just have the ball in your hands, two hands, take a big step with that left foot and pull that right knee up. See this, two hands, eyes are up, one big step with the left foot, pull the right knee forward and up. Here's the continuation, just lets that ball flick right off those fingertips, does a great job of lifting off the ground, keeping his eye on his target, love the arm bar out extended, helping the guard against any defenders coming across his body to get the ball. Here he, there's no dribble, but does a good job of planning that left, chooses to bring the right leg up and power it up off two feet. Again, he kind of shoots it over his right shoulder, but for his size, I call this a baby hook. Look at the flick of the wrist here. And, you know, the ball's right on target to hit the top of the square, go through the net. Here's the lift, his eyes stay up, great push off here, he's starting to pull that right leg and knee, see how he takes it up here with two hands, nice job. Here's the baby hook, just beautiful extension here, good control, lift off that left foot, pulling that right leg up and squaring his body. Nice look. Here he chooses, this is nice, I wanted to show you this. He's not using the backboard, but here's a guy with his size and length and strength and skill. You know, he's just laying that thing right over the rim. Not a lot of people can do that. Beautiful lift, powering it up. Beautiful extension of the body. It's vertical, it's not falling right, left, or backwards. Look how the ball comes off those fingers. Nice job over the rim. Takes a big old step with that left foot, following with the right knee. Eyes are on target. Look how he's got two hands on the ball to give it really good support and control as you lift it into your shot. But he's stepping where he needs to step to push off and get the angle to use the backboard. This is a really nice look here. Very athletic, skilled. He's got some lift, really pulling that right knee up, using that left foot to push off and square his body. Love how he's got his arm bar up. If there's a defender on this side, he's got this arm between the ball and the defender. Great vision, great lift and extension here. Nice job. Here the shooter is going from the left side to the right side to shoot a reverse right hand layup. Great job getting it off the dribble here, getting the ball in two hands. That right hand is behind the ball, that off left guide non-shooting hand comes up to help lift the ball up. Beautiful step here with the left foot where he's gonna really do a great job of pushing off here. Here, here he's beginning to lift it, but see how there's two hands on the ball. Much better control. It's a strong basketball move. Pushing off that left foot. See that right knee come up. Nice job. Again, push off the left, right knee pulled up, but then he lands square to the baseline to the basket. Beautiful extension here of the right shooting arm. Look at the fingers. Nice job. Here's the finish. Comes down with a good staggered stance. Ball's coming off the backboard. His eyes and head are up. If that ball comes off, he's in a position here to get the rebound. Here's this big step, pulling that right knee, two hands on the basketball. Again, beautiful push off of the left foot. He's pulling that right knee up. Going back, he's using this left foot to move his body and to get it more facing the baseline or the basket. But look at this offhand. It's at 90 degree. He's got his shooting hand here behind the ball. Great length here. Very much of a great example of body control and skill. Here's the push-off on the left foot and the drawing of the right knee. He uses that left foot to plant, to push off, to lift, to elevate, but also to square his body to the baseline or to the basket. He's a big guy, so he kind of shoots what I call a little baby hook shot. It's not a full hook shot, but he has such great size, length, skill that he can just kind of shoot it up over, you know, like a, it's almost like a hook shot, but it's a little semi hook shot.

Correct thing to do, just place the bow on the string silently, gently, then add the weight in, then move the bow. We hear a stuttering in the sound at the beginning of this note. That's because the violist came down from too high when placing the hair on the string and didn't have control of the bow, so then the bow bounced against the string. The correct thing to do would be to lightly place the bow on the string in a way where it's not going to have any vertical bounce or horizontal motion so that we don't get any sound until we intentionally pull the first note. We hear a bit of an airy and scratchy sound on these shorter notes that were played in the upper third of the bow. This is because there was not a correct amount of weight. There was too little weight in the bow, and so the scratching came from gliding on top of the string as well as the bow moving up and down, meaning toward the fingerboard and toward the bridge. Ideally, we would want to have enough weight in to where we had great contact with the string, and that great contact would also prevent the bow from leaving that groove that it's in, and then we would just get clear tone. So what the violists should do here is just add in a little bit of weight through their first finger, so the weight of the arm going into the first finger, and then that will transfer it up into this section of the bow and we'll get a clearer sound.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It should be in a straight line, but instead it's curved with her fingertips pointing straight ahead and not on the diagonal. The dancer could be crossing her foot further behind and have help with that if she was to bend her left knee. Bending that leg would help her move it behind her right foot. What you should do instead was rotate the turn a little bit further So that her whole body is facing the front of the room right now. She's still on a slight diagonal Which is why the camera is in view And so if she would have rotated her turn a bit more clockwise to face the front Then when she extended her left leg out It would have been to a true down a true horizontal and then her both right and left left leg would have been on the same plane as each other The reason why her left foot is behind her right foot is because she under rotates her turn And brings her left foot out a bit too soon The dancer is doing a good job of moving her arms to an extreme, both up and down. However, that's the extent of it. It's just the extremities of her limbs moving. And instead, she should also be moving her shoulders, so that her arms are moving as a result of her shoulders moving, and they're moving together, not just her arms independently.

You add some sugar to the milk. and he pours the water and milk mixture into a saucepan. and is pouring it in a coffee mug. And here he has two tea bags that are chai tea bags. So they're already fully mixed with the spices and the tea that's needed to complete this task. Now he places it over the heat. and pours the chai tea. and adds those to the saucepan as well. And you can see here he lifts it off the heat because it is starting to come up to the edge of the pan. So he's turned on his stove already. He's got a flat electric stove top. And every so often he's just moving those tea bags around just to kind of help the process of steeping. sort of manipulates his tea bags here with a fork and his water. Probably at this point the milk and water aren't warm enough to really do any work. So it's a little early for any kind of movement. He adds a couple more squirts of water to the cup. And he presses into the side of the pan to make sure that he doesn't have tea bags about to flop into his cup. He adds some water to the coffee mug as well. He's gotten some milk out of the refrigerator.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

From this moment, looking at the previous movement of the dancer, I think they could even engage their hips and move their hips even more in this moment and really tap that foot and use that ball of the foot to help swivel those hips even bigger. This would again create a more dynamic quality that takes it to that professional level. I just want to point out the great details in this moment. Think about all the way the movement of the hand and the flick of the wrist, all the way throughout their fingertips, and the rolling of the shoulders, and the rolling of the elbows all the way up, while you're having this foot articulation, and this slight hip lift, hip thrust, while they tap their feet. So they're having multiple body rhythms, or holding several movements in their body at once, or several rhythms in their body at once, which is a difficult thing to do. I really appreciate this dancer's engagement with their head. They incorporate every part of their body all the way from their feet to their head. Even their arms and hands are moving in this position. And you can see what we call an undulation, or basically a body roll from the top of the head all the way down through the tailbone. So this is a great example of an undulation in this basic salsa. I would encourage this dancer to think about focus, where is their head, and being intentional about where their head is going. Again, keeping that energy consistent throughout, thinking about how to have more plie in their movement and sending those hips back to have greater range of motion. To improve this movement, the dancers doing a great job of using their arms as an anchor. But to again improve this movement, I would snap that head around even faster. I would spot even faster to be able to turn even quicker and with more precision. I think that this dancer can take even bigger steps to create a more dramatic, dynamic quality and really move on this pendulum with their hips. And they would do that, of course, by bending their legs or having more plie and sending that this tailbone back. And then of course, engaging those arms through the back to make the sweeping motion. So all these things working together basically creates not only just a more dynamic quality, a more dramatic look and feel. So this dance, but also takes it to that professional level.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As you can see him placing it right by his hand. So he's hand matching this and that's going to let him use all of his leg power to pull straight down through the hold. And it will free up his right arm to do what he needs to do. So it's going to take all that tension of his right arm and really take all the body weight and let him move up through it. So still kind of getting all bunched up and doing this foot swap while hand foot matching here when he could be doing it a little bit lower. This would kind of just save him from having to get so bunched up. He could kind of stay closer to the wall and not have to fight it so much in his core. And he's almost kind of back-legging, but he's still got the helican. This left foot's kind of hanging out down below, staying nice and rigid, keeping them balanced. So that way he can kind of match on this pinch and with his left hand out to the sloper. Now this time he kind of just matches on this right side and goes immediately up to the pinch, the bad pinch. So he kind of skips this intermediate on the left side so it looks like the sequence might feel a little bit better. And it kind of keeps him a little bit higher, like on a little bit better hold that he can pull straight down on.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

One hand long, one hand short. Right here, land on both feet at the same time, that way you can eliminate any type of freakish injury. So after the shot, he landed off, off, off cycle kind of like, with one foot clearly in front of the other.

You want to be able to keep that flexion in your knees. That way you can be mobile to be able to transition into the next position. Right here, the ball seems to be off his guy hand a little bit soon. You may want to keep it on there a tad bit longer. The follow through is going straight up.

However, the climber had let go of the right hand to go up further in the reach and in this case he wasn't able to engage a powerful enough move to step up over the right foot. So the climber instead of going with the hand up, had tried to cut himself by holding again to the hold that is matching with the foot. It's important that the climber glances over where the foot positioning is, especially if he's making a foot swap. So the climber in this time is holding on tightly to the jug. This being a positive one, the climber can comfortably rely on the grip while extending the arms to have a better view of the foot positioning. It's important that the climber does the foot hop in and hop out to place the right part of the foot, and this one being the toe to the foot chip below. And place it securely as he would need it to move up onto the next hold. Here we can see the clamber bringing the right foot next to the left hand, both being in the same hold. This is called a match, when both limbs are in the same hold. Here we can see the climber how he has immediately send the hand down to go back into the same position but the right heel did not create enough pressure for the stance and instead has it slipped off from the edge. Trying to release a heel hook usually can be hard to recover as when coming off because the heel hooks need to be released intentionally for any climber and so him using already the foot which is one of the main parts for the base of support has the climber at this moment not be able to sustain the fall. Here we can see the climber rocking himself back and forth. This so that the climber can gain momentum in the moment he needs to step up over the right heel. That is the one being in place next to the hand that right hand has been placed. Now in this moment where the climber was going to go and stand up over the heel, he didn't bring himself to a pull powerful enough and instead of going up for the hold above, he has missed going out for the reach. In this moment he is peeling off the wall due to only having two points of contact on the wall but mostly because he wasn't able to apply the weight over the foot that is placed the highest. Here we can see the climber palming down, meaning walking down, the right hand to the left side of the hold. This to give space for the foot to take placement next to the hand. This is called matching when both hand and foot are placed on the same hold. Now as we can see, the right foot has gone up with the heel being placed on top of the hold, where the climber will rock the heel inside of behind the edge. This is called a heel hook. So the climber will be rolling their heel from the outside to the back of the heel to get it stuck behind the hold. And then the toe will be going up to secure the position of the heel hook behind the edge. Here we can see the climber starting at a two hold start. This one, each hand having its own hold, are bow jugs. In this case the right hand as we can see is placed with the hold being slightly sideways with the entryway on to the left side of that hold. Due to this twist Now that the climber has moved out left to the pinch, he has before then pivoted his left toe to go onto the outer edge of that toe box and brought the left leg with the knee pointing inwards, this to help the climber to keep the left side close to the wall to help with the reach out left. Now that the climber was able to secure that right foot, the climber then lets go of the left foot. This then step up on the right foot that's being placed the highest to drive the hips and to gain leverage. As soon as the climber brings their center of gravity at a higher stance, the climber then can quickly remove the left hand to make a placement out to join the hand above. Here the climbers are starting at a two-hold start, each hand holding onto a jug, which the top one is slightly placed sideways, where the climber will have to engage the outer part of the palm to create pressure. It has a positive grip, meaning that a hole behind it and the climber has comfortably wrapped a hand around the edge, helps the climber to endure this grip for quite some time and lean comfortably back by placing force onto that grip. Now the climber with the other hand, being the left one, is also a jug, but this time is opening is onto the side and so the climber wraps the hands from the outside in. So the climber must pull on that hold slightly upwards and inwards. As the climber holds onto the holds tight, must bring the feet up onto the wall and the hips then will have to be, the weight that is carried on from the hips, the climber then will transfer it down to the foot that are positioned below. When the climber is off the mat, then the climber starts.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Her knees are bent and she's just kind of in the groove of the music, which looks great. So here I feel like her energy finally kind of picked up with that movement that she just did across the space So I think she definitely could have elevated the energy throughout At the level that she is at now So here she brings her arms around. She definitely kind of cuts off the last one a little bit and doesn't fully go around. So again, making sure to do those steps full out. So here she does all of these steps in this space. Her feet fell a little flat, so definitely want to get up on the toes, keep the knees bent throughout the movements, and then that'll help her to move around a little bit easier. Same thing with the arms. I think that felt a little rush as she pushed her, brushed her hand over her arm, over her head. So definitely take your time with that also. So here, I spin around, she kind of got a little bit caught up, so definitely want to just add more energy and that would definitely help her to spin around without feeling the need to stop or kind of push yourself a little more midway. So here when she brings the arms up, she definitely takes her time on that part. And you see her kind of flick her wrist out. So that was a nice job there. So here she steps forward. I want to make sure you get on the balls of the feet. The knees can be straight or bent, just depending on how comfortable you feel in either position. And definitely can twist the hips a little bit more as she steps forward. So from the beginning, the dancer starts, she does all the steps on beat. Her energy feels a little low, so definitely want to, in that first kick, really kick a little harder and just really get the energy up a little bit higher. So overall, really good job. This is a pretty difficult dance, and she was able to do all of the steps, but just want to make sure that she does them all full out and not really cut any arms off in their movement. So again, great job up to here. Don't really have any more notes, more just staying more on the balls of the feet, so that way the movements stay a little bit lighter. So in this position, she can definitely, well the right knee is bent correctly, but this left leg can definitely extend out a little bit straighter into more of a lunge to the side so then she can really scoop and brush her arm down. I felt like that was really rushed, so she's definitely going to take in more time in this movement. So here as she kicked her right leg around and in this position both feet are flat on the floor, I definitely think she can lean back on this right leg a little bit more, so most of the weight's on the right leg as she does the body roll. So here with the arm that comes around, she kind of just dropped it down really quick. So definitely want to let it fall and take a little more time to fall down and around.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

I think this dancer can definitely move their rib cage even further to the side, which would over accentuate the movement and create a greater dynamic. I will also repeat my previous comments about having power and strength throughout the arms. I would encourage the dancer to be more grounded. Notice how this leg is very straight and this one is very bent. I would encourage them both to be bent and then maybe one leg could be more bent than the other. Also to send those hips back so they have more range of motion. I repeat comments I made in previous video about spotting and making sure you whip that head around quickly. Here I'll repeat my previous comments about grounding, but also making sure to have that hip articulation. I would encourage this dancer to really think about this arm here.

It just feels really like she's breathing and she's taking her time and really connecting with the like lyrical flow of the music. So really nice job just keeping the movements very mellow and simple but still accurate. So here she steps forward. She's kind of sliding her feet on the floor so I definitely think she can go more on the balls of her feet to step out and do the twist so it's very clear step step step as well as twisting her knees out to the side when she twists and walks. So here she does a bit of a body roll. I think she can definitely open her legs out a bit more just to be a little more grounded in the movement as well as bending her knees more so that way the roll is coming from the bottom up and not just her upper body doing all the work. And through to the end, same thing as before, just really nice fluid movements and really finding the lyrical notes of the music and connecting with that. So really beautiful work. So here, watching her body is just really nice and wavy as she does this step. So really beautiful work there. So here with the arms, definitely want to extend those arms out as they go around so they're not bent or being cut off in the movement. So in the first couple counts, she does a really great job hitting every step, keeping her movements nice and light, keeping her knees bent throughout the movements, as well as using the space well. So really nice job in the opening. So here, just a stance concern, I think she can open her legs out a bit more, again, to have a bit more groundedness to her movement. So if her feet are out, then her knees will be a little more bent, and then she can really roll that head all the way around, down and up below her shoulders. So here I felt like this part was a bit rushed in the step into this like lunging moment with the leg extended out and then her left arm reaching down and around. I think if she took her time up like take a half a second maybe a whole count more it really could have allowed her to really brush the floor with her arm for a little bit longer. So here as she turned around in each direction, I really like that her movements are really smooth and consistent in their energy level so she's not forcing anything, but she's able to hit each step correctly and on the correct beat and all of the accents.

It's kind of going across the basket instead of to the basket. Let's get that follow through, following the ball to the backboard. Great elevation of the left arm, much better follow through here with that arm, that shooting left hand arm following the ball to the basket. Great lifting of the hips, elevation off the balls of the feet. Again, keep that ball up high. I love that it ends up in two hands. As you get balanced and gather yourself to go back up again, knees are bent. Again, would benefit be more effective if it was more of a step through, a one-two step and up. This person's just choosing to go from side to side with a two-foot takeoff. But again, as he transitions from the right, the left side, lets the ball come out of the rim and drop, becomes very vulnerable. This drill is meant to be a rebound and drill, keeping those hands and eyes up. But love how he bends his knees as he prepares to go up. But let's keep this ball up high. You're going to be definitely more effective and more successful. Here he lets it drop really a little bit too low, but love that he's been in his knees ready to jump, eyes and head are up. Again, drops that left shoulder, therefore drops the ball. Let's keep it up high. But I love the fact that he never loses sight of where he wants to go with the basketball.

That guide hand is bent, comes off to add some support there and kind of be between the ball and the defense. Nice job. Again, not real good footwork here. It's effective, I will say. I mean, it's not the, probably the way the micin' is meant to be. It's more of a step through and elevate off one foot, but some people find it as they're learning to go off two feet, but great positioning here with that shooting hand behind the ball. The guide hand is adding support. You can see it here as the person attempts to shot that left hand guide hands. They are to offer a little token pressure, but will come off for the shot. Here the shooter is shooting, doing the Mike and drill going from right to left side. He is choosing to go off two feet and just kind of move side to side, if you will, is effective that way, shooting with the correct hand on both sides. The extension of the left hand on the shooting side might work on the spacing a little bit here, maybe a little bit too close to the rim, but nice job. Again, great lift and extension here. I love the guide hand here on the side. Great extension of the right arm as the shot leaves the hand. Again, love the lift, extension of the body, great positioning and angle here. That ball's leaving the left hand. We got a little space here in cushioning, the ball's sitting on the pads of the fingers. I love that the arm bar is bent at 90 degree, eyes and head are up. This is a really good look here. Again, kind of short arms adhere instead of extending that shooting right elbow to the rim. Would love to see some lift and elevation here. I love that his arm bar is bent and there to add protection from the defense. Love that his arms and hands are up as he makes his way to the left from the left to the right side but again would be definitely be more effective in this drill if he would time his movement by stepping through and lifting and elevating.

So that means their back, their torso, their hips, all of that movement and making sure they breathe throughout that movement. Another thing I would encourage the dancer to think about is texturing of the movement. So what movement should be soft versus what movement should be hard, especially because this is labeled advanced choreography. Right? Not all movements should look exactly the same. The dancer does a really good job of doing these staccato movements. I would again encourage them to think about their hip articulation throughout it and how can they incorporate their head in the movement to keep the flow and energy and overall dynamic quality engaged without it looking awkward. I would encourage the dancer to engage their shoulders and use their torso as an extension of their arms to create more fluidity throughout the movement. I think the dancer should also think about making sure that they are grounded throughout their movement. So sending, making sure they plie, but also sending those hips back a bit creates more range of motion. So they're not trying to, the dancer is not trying to push through a small axis to work through while they're dancing. Instead, if they're in this kind of bended motion, they have a greater range of motion to be able to circle their hips or move their legs or rotate their arm or circulate that torso. When you're working from a straight kind of pencil like movement, it's hard to be able to articulate and have that same type of flow. I would encourage a dancer to be more grounded in their movement and to really think about flow and musicality because some of their movement can sometimes look awkward.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I would also encourage a dancer to not only just use their hips, but also isolate their ribcage more, so they have full embodiment of the rhythm.

However, if these steps were not choreographed, one should be able to still go through movement if the leading dancer is able to utilize their role in an effective way where they are directing the dancer, where the turns are and what the steps are. As long as you know the basic steps, a dance could look just like this, whether it's choreographed or not. The timing is very nice with these two dancers. When they go to shift and change hands, the dancers have steps in between and they begin and end them at the same time, not losing connection with the dancer. Musicality wise, like based on the music, they do let go hands, but if they were holding hands, it would have looked the same, the way that they were both in sync with one another and they were on the right count and the right step with the feet. The dancer that's leading does a great job to indicate when the dancer who's following should turn. I could see the thrust in the right side of the body from the lead.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This is a good example right here. I really like the players striking technique here, taking a longer run up as a longer final step with the left foot. Arms are out for balance, this longer step has helped bring the non-kicking foot next to the ball and then the striking foot swinging from a further distance to come through the ball in this area. The player has struck the ball straight down the middle of the goal. This would be saved by the goalkeeper. We want to be aiming for these side window pockets here as this gives the best chance of scoring. The player has also struck the ball with very little power due to not having a large run up and not attempting to put any power into the shot. Good use of the arms for balance by the player. There's a good body shape, I like that. Players taking a very short and quick run up into the ball. This isn't conducive to having a proper strike and generating power. We would instead want them to step two or three steps back so they could actually run up and into the ball to strike it. The player has made good contact with the inside of the foot, follow through has gone through the line of the ball. This helps with the power and accuracy. The player's approach to the ball would be better with a bigger distance. This allows him to step into the ball, create more power so that when the shot is taken he has a better chance of beating the goalkeeper. The player's non-kicking foot is too close to the ball. Positioning-wise, it could be a little further forward, but this is okay. We certainly would want the ball to be more in this region here, as that would mean his right foot, the striking foot, can swing through the ball and not have to swing really close to his left knee. The player has not created enough power on the shot and so that would have been saved by the goalkeeper. The accuracy is also not in the corner. This is too close to the centre of the goal. Goalkeeper would save it. Body shape, leaning away, arms really out there for balance, non-kicking foot, knees bent, all these are good at keeping the player balanced. Contact point with the laces, his heel is up, toe is down, ankle locked, and striking through the ball. I really like the player's angle of approach. It helps to allow the striking leg to swing through the ball. I like the non-kicking foot placement. And the player's body shape could be a little bit lower, a little bit more bent in the knee to help with the balance, but he isn't moving at that great of a speed. So balance isn't that important to him at this moment. Good accuracy, put the ball in the side net in, see where we want the ball to go. However, it needs to go there with more power. The player can generate more power by actually placing the ball down, having a set run up and making sure that they go through the mechanics. Right now the player is just rushing through each shot, which is not conducive to improving this specific technique. Mae'n bwysig iawn. Ball yn y gwrn o'r golwg, yn y ffyrdd, lle rhaid i ni ei wneud. Yr unig welliant yw bod yn rhaid i'w gyrraedd gyda mwy o fwy. Rwy'n hoffi fyned y chwaraewyr yma, defnyddio'r arau i'w gydbwys. Gallwch weld eu bod nhw'n allan o'r siwr.

Really good follow through from the player. So as his right leg crosses over his left, the left leg comes up in the air, so he can move that left leg back out to a normal anatomical position, which will help him regain his balance quickly.

So, this is good placement of the ball on the backboard, but when we hit this portion of the backboard, we have to make sure that the side spin that we use is a slight amount of side spin or no side spin at all. Because if we put too much side spin on the ball, as it hits this portion of the backboard, it can spin off and end up hitting the left side of the rim, and then that's how we end up missing this layup. In this case, he put too much side spin on the ball, and it bounced off the backboard and hit the left side of the rim. After making the layup, he does a good job of catching the ball. However, he allows the ball to drop down to his waist area. When we're doing the Mike and Drill, we want to keep the ball high near our upper chest or neck area and never allow the ball to drop down to our waist level. The player here shows the proper footwork for doing a right hand layup on the right side of the basket when we're doing the Miken drill. And we're doing the Miken drill where we're jumping off of one foot. So you see he is jumping off of his left foot. Now when we're jumping off of our left foot, we want to try to get as high up into the air as we possibly can. In order to do that, we have to make sure that this right knee is raised up to the level of our hips. As you can see, his knee is far below the level of his waist so he didn't give maximum effort or anywhere near the maximum effort to jump as high as possible in order to finish the layup and release the ball at the highest possible point. Let's take a look at the placement of the ball on the backboard. You can see it's well outside of the square on the backboard and it's also above the top portion of the square on the backboard. You can see from this view, it's a better view and you can see just how much higher from the top of the square the ball actually hit the backboard. So as it's placed outside of the square and the height at which the ball hit the backboard is also very good. However, from this position, we need to make sure that we put enough side spin on the ball so the ball can spin off of the backboard and go directly into the basket from this position on the backboard. With this shot attempt, the player didn't put enough side spin on the ball so it hit this portion of the backboard and then it dropped down and fell short of the rim. he correctly catches the ball out of the net and then he's as he's catching the ball out of the net he steps with his right foot to the left side of the basket catches it and then jumps off of his left foot in order to shoot the layup in his left hand on the left side of the basket. As you can see again now on this side his left knee is low and we want that left knee to be up towards his knee level, towards his hip level in order to explode on the jump and reach the highest possible point of his jump so he can release the ball instead of releasing the ball here if he jumps higher he can release the ball here and the higher the release point the more difficult it is for the defense to block the shot Go to www.Flydreamers.com for all of your free flyer training!", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She's bending her knee effectively while straightening that back leg that's crossing behind the supporting leg. She could use a little bit refinement in the positioning of her arm, particularly her hands. She's also kind of overextending her elbow here, so some additional clarity in the shaping of the arms, particularly the one that's reaching above her head, but also the one that's crossing in front specifically with the shaping of her hands. As the dancer performs some quicker footwork, crossing this right leg over the left leg in a small jump or a pattern of small jumps, she demonstrates that she's able to move very quickly and efficiently and maintain the appropriate kind of size of movement to move so quickly while maintaining that rhythmic embodiment. She would again benefit from some additional movement in her pelvis and perhaps a more complex engagement of her upper body, including her arms. However, she's able to stay on the rhythm and on tempo as she performs these quicker, more advanced steps. As the dancer performs this basic salsa step, moving backwards and forwards in the space, she demonstrates that she has a fair understanding of the movement vocabulary, as well as the rhythmic embodiment required for this movement. She would benefit from grounding a bit more, dropping that pelvis back and bending the knees, as well as some additional clarity in her arm choreography, and some additional motion happening particularly in her pelvis and the engagement of the upper body. As the dancer performs this ball change moving backwards into the space, she's able to effectively and clearly engage her arms choreographically, as well as maintain a nice slight bend in the knees and a nice and appropriate range of motion in the pelvis. Overall, she appears confident in this step and she's even able to engage the arms in a way that's dynamically interesting. As the dancer performs this small shimmying or bouncing of her shoulders, she's got a nice clear positioning with her arms choreographically, as well as a nice slight bend in her knees. She's able to move her shoulders on rhythm here, which shows that she's able to deeply embody the rhythm and add some interesting movement dynamics as well. As the dancer performs a series of small step touches, she demonstrates that she has stronger control over her rhythmic embodiment, particularly in her lower body. She's able to play with different rhythms in the music, as well as maintains clarity in her upper body, in her arms, her torso, and her head.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So you want to make sure that your form is correct and just very strong, especially in this front arm, because if it doesn't, then it looks kind of cartoonish and kind of like you're playing around and not really being serious in the moment. So definitely want to have really strong arms. But I do like that both eyes are facing the side. They're facing the same direction, and they're moving together. So here they are standing side by side. His left arm is at his shoulder and then his right arm is down close to the lower of his back but they are crossed together and they are stepping forward and back with a little chasse forward and ball change step and then chasse back. So really nice job here staying together and also using the outside leg at the same time. So again still that same mirror effect that they're doing. Here they're just taking some steps forward and back. Again, I think if they were much better to be on the correct beat of the music it would just look a little bit better but because they're so off it's just hard to kind of follow and really connect if they're so off the music. So here they did a little body change and movement with each other. They're a bit off. They're just not quite doing the exact same thing, so I'm not sure what the choreography is meant to be. We have a nice little different movement in the arm. So they have this full circle to keep themselves connected. And they're both facing the opposite direction and stepping around. So really nice job making that transition very seamless from the last formation. So here's a good space where they both, they're doing different things, but they're actually complimenting each other as he's pulling him through and around. So that looks nice. I definitely think they can both bend their knees a little bit more and try to step a little bit lighter on their feet. So here they're just doing some like small chasse to the side and a ball change. There are some moments where they are matching each other's movements, but most times they are not. So that just kind of brings down the step. So here the dancers are stepping forward and back. I like that they are doing the opposite legs. So he's using his right leg and he's using his left. So it's almost like a mirror to each other. So here when they, after they switch places and go around, they're still connected by the hand correctly, but they are kind of leaning their body back as they step out of the connection. And he doesn't need to lean back that far. I think you still want to kind of keep your body as straight as possible, just straight up and down and less pulling back. Cause it looks like you're actually pulling each other. So here's a walk around. I definitely think they can either disconnect hands or at least just kind of pick up their energy a little bit more and pick up their feet so it's not so heavy to the floor. So here they're doing some jump kicks forward. They're not quite as in sync for this one, so they are a little bit off the... They're definitely off the music as a whole, but also with each other. They're not together. But the jumps are really good. They're keeping their movements nice and light as they move through the jumps.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

They're a little too focused on the hands Which is why we see the foot kind of pop off the first move before they begin setting up Ideally they can make the first few moves static by coming underneath into this undercling and then reaching up to the hold But the way there's charging up anticipates that they just want to commit to making this a bigger move, which is Potentially doable but much higher risk. It's such a large move that if they make a mistake attempting it It's gonna invalidate the attempt. They'll just fall So you see a climber releasing way too early, their foot's almost on the ground as their hand is reaching towards the hold, so there's just no chance they're going to be able to hit it from this position. It's probably doable as a dyno to jump across that way, but for the way they're climbing it, they're just not going to hit the move this way and it causes them to fall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

As we can see when the climber went up for the reach she had kept the right knee to come inwards and that helped for the climber to keep her right side of the body towards the wall when performing the reach. The climber was able to send the left hand quickly to the next hole at reach, this one being a jug, where the climber is able to secure the hand placement. However, it's all about the body position. This one, because the left leg was out and extended as a flag, the climber only areas of support were onto the right side. So to avoid herself from doing a barn door, which is like, think of a hinge that opens up, the climber folds the left leg behind the right leg. This to add, with the left foot pointing out to the right, is to give more support to the right side and twists the body over to the left to bring her center of gravity close to the wall when performing the reach. The climber continues into a close pull up to lock the move. And this is because right now the climber is staring at the next hold at reach. This is because if the climber was to extend the arms right now, she will be dropping the weight too low, being really hard to pull in if she wanted to come back. The climber was able to recover the move by bringing the left foot to come into place over the start hold and she continues to glance down at the feet to perform a foot switch by bringing the right toe to come into place over the edge of the hold to release the left foot from its place. The climber performing this type of foot switch technique is the most accurate one. This is because it's more energy efficient and the climber can transfer the load easily from one foot to the other coming into place. The climber once securing the toe placement we can see how she has brought the knee to come inwards towards the wall so that she was able to transfer over the weight to the right foot. In doing so the climber quickly releases the right hand to bring it over to a match at the hold above. The climber was able to place the left hand grip into a solid hand grip. This one because the climber is sustaining to the lip of the hold being a rail and is able to place the fingers behind the lip of the hold. Once the climber gets to secure the grip, then the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the highest grip. The climber right now is glancing at a hold at reach. This one the climber will have to perform a dynamic move. Reason why she has lower her center of gravity and extended the arms in order to gain energy over the jump. As we can see the left leg being extended. This is called flagging out and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. Now the right foot when being pressed for going up for the dynamic move will help the climber to gain height. And the left toe tapped against the wall will help the climber to gain direction on the reach as well as bringing her center of gravity close to the wall when performing the stance. In this case, before the climber was able to perform the next move at reach, she is bringing the right toe to come out of match at the foot hold. And this is so the climber is performing a foot switch where she is placing the outer edge of the toe towards the hold. And as soon as the climber releases the left toe from its place, the climber then will roll in the toe above the hold. The climber on the lock position sends quickly the left hand out for the reach, this one being a positive grip as the climber is able to wrap the hand over the hold. The climber was able to gain a stability over the movement by sending the right leg to be extended behind the left foot. This again back flagging so the climber can gain a stability over the move and quickly once it's stabilized the climber sends the left hand over to the jug to come into a match where the right hand is. The climber at first was struggling on making a foot placement for the left toe but brings it quickly into a high foot placement to bring it behind the hold securing the toe placement. As soon as the climber applied pressure onto the foothold, the climber's right toe has come out of place from the hold. Right now the climber is sustaining onto the grips for a slight swing due to the wall being overhung. It's important the climber always glances down at the feet, especially when making a new foot placement. In this case, the climber is bringing the left toe to come into a high foot placement over the foot hold. This one sticks out and makes it possible for the climber to place a good chunk area of the toe over the hold. Once the climber gets secured the foot placement, then the climber can move on to the next hold at reach. Due to the opening of the left hand grip being slightly onto the left side, the climber must drop the weight by leaning back to the right. And now the climber is twisting the body completely at a 180 to bring the right side of the body towards the wall in order to bring the left foot to a high foot placement. The climber starts at a one hold start. As we can see, both of the hands are placed into the same hold. This is called matching. And as we can see, the climber is placing the hands as open grips where she places the fingers over the edge of the hold. However, the climber must create pressure, the reason why the climber is leaning over to the left side due to the entry being onto the right side of the hold. The climber had performed a step up start, so once the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall, then the climb will start. And had positioned the left foot onto a foot hold. And bringing the knee in, so the climber can keep the left side of the body towards the wall. Now, when the climber had stepped up, the right leg has gone extended. This is called flagging out, so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. And keeping the leg on a flag when the climber performs the move will help the climber to gain balance and stability over the move. The climber had repositioned the right hand grip, this one to hook it behind the hold as the hold is a horn so the climber can continue to have a closed grip. In this case, the climber in releasing some of the pressure on the hand to readjust the grip she has kept the left leg to be extended. This is called flagging out so the climber was able to continue to apply pressure onto the right foot being in place. As we can see, the climber is sending the right knee over to the right to keep the hips square as the climber is pressing the right toe towards the lip of the hold onto the right side. Now the climber is glancing over to the next hold at reach. Due to the dynamic move, the climber has lost pressure at the right foot placement and now both of the feet in the air, the climber must sustain tight onto the grips to control the swing. And in able to bring the foot back into place onto the wall, the climber must engage body tension to tighten up the core to pick up the feet to replace the foot back onto the wall. When the feet are out in the air, this is called cutting feet. The climber at this moment is spending a considerable amount of time to look for a foot placement on the left foot and Right now the climber is sustaining to a positive grip above which the climber can sustain over for some time however Doing this for a while it can tire the grips The climber after positioning the toe over the foothold then she quickly releases the right hand that was underneath the left hand to send it over to the next hold at reach. This type of hold that she is sustaining, she is able to place the hand over the lip of the hold being a jug and once securing the grip the climber can extend the arm to drop the weight onto the grip. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet when performing a foot placement or a foot switch. In this case, the climber has brought the right foot that was out on the flag to bring the toe to come into place at a foothold. It's important that the climber is accurate with the placement on positioning exactly on a certain spot of the foothold as well as positioning the right area of the foot to create pressure. As we can see on this view, also the right hand was sustaining into a positive hold as the climber was able to wrap around the hand behind the lip of the hold. The climber now engages into a pull-up to bring the right hand over to a match at the last hold. This, the climber must demonstrate control and stability over the match as well as her body position in order to complete the climb. The climber is about to perform the next move at reach, sending the left hand up. So the climber in this moment is tapping the right toe towards the wall, this to engage more power over the reach as the climber will send the heart over the left foot and the tap will help the climber to drive force onto the stance.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

We'd like to see when that leg comes around, that standing leg a little bit more stable so that the dancer can pivot off of that back leg and bring that leg around a little bit more and that standing leg goes into a bended leg so that we can get more mobility and action out of that left leg that comes around when the dancer hits the foot.

They have a really clear, defined spot to be in and it makes his turns look a lot cleaner because they are leveled at his chest and just in a nice place. So really nice job on the turns. So here he crosses over in front right now with his left leg. He draws his arm to cross over his head, which is a nice improvised movement, and change the arms. I do think he could have maybe used the space a little bit more on the cross and rotate his body to face the side as he crossed over, just to give a bit of a different dynamic since he's facing front for the entire time. Here the dancer starts stepping in place. He does a really good job picking his feet up off the floor slightly. His knees are nicely bent and he has a good rotation in his arms, shoulders, and back. Here as he taps forward, nice job keeping the knees nicely bent, tapping out, and then also changing the arms a little bit so they're also tapping with the foot, as well as moving a little bit of hips and shoulder movements as well. Here he steps out to the side. I think this heel could come off the floor just a little bit, but he does do a good job getting a nice space between the legs, keeping the knees nicely bent, and again, keeping the upper body moving around.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They have a lot of clarity, particularly in their footwork. They're incorporating their arms in a way that's clear, though it's a bit stiff and lacking connection to the rhythm and movement dynamics. And overall, they're really suffering from not grounding. They need to bend their knees deeper, drop their pelvis, and activate a sense of polyrhythm or movement dynamic within their pelvis and upper body in general. As a dancer begins with a basic stationary salsa step, they appear to be familiar with the movement vocabulary and comfortable executing the movement. They are including their arms choreographically in a way that makes sense and is appropriate for the movement technique, and are maintaining a steady connection to the rhythm, particularly through the use of their feet and incorporating some slight movement through the head. However, they appear quite stiff from their pelvis through their upper body to their shoulders. If they were to bend their knees a bit more, drop the pelvis back, be more grounded, loose and natural, and a bit more weighted in their movement, they would appear to execute the movement with more clarity, efficiency, and connection to the rhythm and the music. As the dancer performs a series of turns, he falls off the tempo demands of the music, which disconnects him from his rhythmic embodiment, particularly because he doesn't consistently spot his head, which is making him move through these turns more slowly than the music is demanding and thus throwing him off from the rhythmic embodiment. As the dancer begins a basic salsa step where they're stepping one foot out meeting the feet back in the middle and then alternating sides They find a bit more clarity and connection to the rhythm particularly through this nice bend in their knees and a slight dropping back of the pelvis They also are continuing to incorporate their arms in a way that's choreographically appropriate However, because their upper body in general is quite stiff from the lack of grounding in their performance Their arms are also coming off a bit stiff as well keeping them from deeply connecting to the rhythm", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The dancer's left arm here is bent and instead he should be extending it completely in a straight line. The dancer has to be careful here in how, in which he's raising his shoulders. His shoulder blades are raised very high, which eliminates his neckline and makes him look tense in his upper body area. So this is not a part of the dance choreography, but instead the dancer is freestyling and doing movements of his own choosing as a way to feel the music and mentally and physically prepare for the dance routine, as well as get into his body and his own artistry and interpretation. So it's really good that he is moving like this prior to the start of the dance routine. The dancer is turning on a flat foot with his entire foot on the ground, his toes, the ball of his foot, meaning the middle of his foot, and his heels. Instead, when the dancer hits his ending pose in which he was raising his arms out towards his left side, he should hold that pose, remain frozen and still, so that it is clear that the dance is ending and that he finishes in a neat position. Especially since it's the very last movement of the dance routine, it's important that it's done meticulously and with care. The dancer is looking downward on his turn. The floor is in his view, as well as his head and neck are tilted downward. The dancer exits his ending pose very quickly, and so it's not very clear as to what it is because it happens so fast, and it's not done in a way that the audience's eye can take it in as a strong finish. Instead, the dancer should be pressing his shoulder blades down. It's okay that his elbows are pointing outward. Also they should be pointing outward on the same angle, one is higher than the other. But in general, it's okay that his elbows are pointing outward, he just needs to also simultaneously press his shoulder blades down so his neckline remains elongated. Instead, the dancer should raise his focus and look straight ahead with his chin parallel to the floor, which would help him not get dizzy as he does a revolution or rotation in this turn.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As the dancer continues through the choreography, she quite clearly doesn't remember the choreography and is struggling to reenact it. She is really almost consistently looking off camera over her left shoulder, perhaps to another dancer or instructor in the room, and overall just appears a little bit confused in the choreography and therefore is not able to execute it. As the dancer begins his choreography, right off the bat she's thrown off from the music and appears a bit confused about her starting timing. You can see here she's looking over her left shoulder quite significantly, perhaps to someone or something off camera, and overall appears a bit hesitant as she begins his choreography. As the dancer continues through the choreography, she starts to appear quite confident, engaging a greater range of motion in her pelvis, her upper body, and her shoulders. She continues to consistently incorporate her arms as well as find some consistent clarity in her footwork as well. As the dancer gets back into the choreography and starts to find her place within the movement again, she right away is able to connect again to the rhythm of the music and has a strong incorporation of her arms choreographically in a way that's clear, precise, and appropriate. She also has similar clarity in her footwork and is able to incorporate movement in her pelvis and through her upper body.

Looking at the player's release from his right-handed reverse layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice that the player does really well at jumping with full maximum effort, allowing his body's momentum, carrying him forward closer towards the target. The player also does really well extending his follow-through above his shoulders, allowing the ball to gain more arc to get above the rim. Thanks for watching! Looking at the player going into his jump on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player does really well locating his eyes on his target before going into his release, allowing a much easier finish. Also does really well jumping off his left foot, allowing his body's momentum to carry and guide him towards the right side of the rim. Thanks for watching! Looking at the player's release on his right-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice that the player does really well at getting his shoulders square towards the back of the rim after the release, allowing the ball a better angle of being directed accurately towards the target area. The player also does a good job getting his fall through extended above his shoulder, allowing the ball to create a higher release to get above the rim, going as we look on the left side of the frame, directly towards our target point, allowing it to create the proper angle it needs of dropping inside the rim, resulting in a completed layup attempt. Looking at the player's release on his right-handed reverse layup attempt on the left frame, we can notice that the player does really well getting his follow-through and wrist snapping towards the direction of the rim in our target area, allowing the ball to create the proper spin and rotation and arc it needs to get above the rim, hitting our target area, which is going to be the top right corner of the box on the backboard, allowing it to develop the proper angle it needs, dropping inside the rim. Looking at the player going into his jumping motion, on his right hand at reverse layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice that the player does really well jumping forward with full maximum effort, allowing the ball to gain enough momentum, power, and art to get above the rim.

As we look on the left frame, we can tell and notice that the ball hits our target point, which is going to be the top right corner of the box on the backboard, allowing it to develop the proper angle it needs to drop inside the rim. A slight improvement the player can make to avoid potential turnovers in a game-like scenario as we look on the right side of the frame is bringing his ball placement position above his shoulders, creating separation from opposing defenders. In a game-like scenario, having easy access of stripping, taking, or stealing the ball. This also helps the player create more ball control and security going into his finish as well as creating a closer gap of releasing the ball quicker towards our target area. Another benefit that helps the player from his body placement position being lower in the athletic stance as we look on the right frame helps prevent opposing defenders in a game-like scenario being able to easily knock the offensive player off his position by initiating contact.

And that'll just help again with the timing because she's been off for the entire time. And then also getting the three steps for the triple steps between the rocks a little cleaner. So here she's changing the direction of her rock step triple step. She's now going forward and back instead of side to side. She's getting a bit mixed up in her feet so I think when stepping forward really planting that foot down and kind of lunging with that knee forward and then really stepping back. But again staying light on your toes as well would definitely help for the transition between going side to side and front and back. So here the dancer is doing a rock step triple step. Just a few notes, definitely bending the knees a little bit more, getting up on her toes a bit more just to have a little more lightness and bouncing her steps. And then also don't forget your upper body. There should be some level of just like being relaxed in that upper body, cause right now it's really stiff. So it's affecting her entire performance. She has the basics of a rock step triple step, like she's able to do it, but there still has to be some lightness to the movement. So bending those knees and getting around those toes would help a lot. Yeah, so here she's losing her balance a little bit. I think just because she's sitting back more on her heels and less on her toes, so her weight should kind of be a bit more forward and straight and less back and leaning back. So here, yeah, she's putting her heel down when she steps forward. And I think it should be the toe and then like stepping with the toe and bending that foot kind of into a lunge when she steps forward on the triple step. And I think that would just help with the flow of stepping front, then stepping back to triple step and then stepping back to rock step because when she steps back, she's stepping on her toes. So she should do the same coming forward just for the weight shift to look a little smoother. And I'll say the way that she's dancing now is something I tell my students, like kind of get out of your head and get more into your body. So I think if she, I know she's talking it out, but I think if she kind of let her body just do the movement and really connect with the music, it would just make the movements flow a little bit better.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This is so that the climber is able to maintain balance as he will need to force by shifting his weight onto the highest foot. Also when climber makes the move, it will help the climber to keep the hips square and to keep himself close to the wall. Here, in order for the climber to release the right toe out of place, he has brought the left toe to be placed on top of the matching hold that he had instead. This to release the right foot out of place. The climber continually needs to pull on the grips while making this foot switch. If the climber was going to try this again, it's important that the climber uses the resource of the left pinch. There's many forms in which a climber can achieve a series of moves to attain the goal. In this case, the right foot was way too high for the climber and made it very uncomfortable for him to shift the weight over to the highest foot. The outer side of the foot was what was placed onto that edge and it seemed promising that the climber's foot was going to remain in such place. However, what drove the climber's center of gravity away from the wall was the moment that he released his right hand. This due to the left foot not being placed on any hold down below, only relying on two points of contact at that moment. So it's important to the climber if he was going to attempt this again that he scans down at other areas where he can place his feet in order to release his right hand. When the climber released the left hand carefully from going underneath the foot and as soon as he places the elbow outside the leg, you can see how the climber was losing control of keeping himself in control to make the next move. Notice followed by the right foot coming out of place. The climber starts at a two hand hold start. As we can see the right hand is placed with the fingers above and the climber in order to create pressure has to lean underneath that hold. On the other hand, you can see how the climber's hold is upside down. This is a jug and in order to create friction the climber will have to place the palm upwards and slide the fingers behind the hold. Now in order for the climber to create pressure, we'll need to pull the hold towards him. As we can see the climb will start until the feet are off the mat, which he's already doing. The left foot right now is being placed on the foot chip down below. The right foot is coming into position to match where the left hand is. As the climber have reached the left hand to the pinch, we can see the climber sending the right foot that was out on the flag to be placed to match where his right hand grip is. The type of hold that the climber is holding onto and has placed the foot on, it's a ledge that sticks out so the climber can bring the right foot and apply sufficient pressure onto that edge with the outer side of the foot. This is an unusual placement as most likely he might potentially use this as a heel hook in the future if he continues to keep the foot on place. Now the climber is a bit crunched up to the right side and needs to release the right hand. In order to add force to the foot that's placed the highest, the climber has let go of the left foot placement down below. This to apply more force onto the right foot being placed which he will use almost like a third hand since this will keep the climber to keep himself pulled into the wall. Since the right foot has come into a stance, the climber quickly releases the left hand that was on the undercling so that he gets to bring it to a match where the right hand is. This one is a big hold so the climber is able to comfortably fit both of the hands by wrapping the fingers behind it and comfortably leaning on the hold. The climber places the toe above the hold as he pulls on the hold down below. This is called matching and it's important that the climber keeps pressure at the foot against the hold in order to sustain himself when pulling on the grips above. This because the climber is placing the entire leg in front of him. Now the climber will need to think about making the next movement.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Because the climber hasn't placed any foot placements onto the wall, he is right now engaging onto a pull-up in order to move on. This is called campusing. The climber, once sustaining the positive grip above being the edge, he is able to then lean back to place the weight onto the grip. As we can see, he's pivoting over his foot because he's sending the ankle outwards in order to smear the foot against the hold as he needs to continually have contact with the hold to not lose the foot placement. So it's like dragging the sole of the shoe to be repositioned where he can't face the wall this time. The climber performing campusing doesn't only involve fully on a pull-up, it also involves body movement and swinging to gain momentum. So when the climber is having the momentum of the swing, whenever he goes out for example to the right, he will engage that right arm on a pull-up to release the left hand. Whenever the climber is ready to engage of the left hand for example, then he will swing over the body over to the left in order to release the right hand. At this view we can see how the climber is sustaining to a jug hold and the good thing about jugs is that they can be held in any direction so the climber must squeeze into the hold forcefully in order to sustain the grip as he right now is going out on the swing almost as a pendulum totally on 180 at this moment so it's important that the climber eventually tightens up the core and engages on the pull up so that he's able to slow down the swing This is the ideal closeness that should be committed on this type of jump. As a climber, as we can see, the chest was brought forward and then the core, being the center of gravity, will follow as the climber starts gaining height. The left hand is still continuing to be on the hand placement and instead of pulling himself in, he's also pushing down onto that hand placement. But at this point, it's just a placement as the climber already is launched onto the air and eventually he will push down onto the right foot to boost the move. The right hand is already pretty close at distance since he has already removed it from the start hold. It's about a matter of time for the climber to bring the right hand to come into a slap above the hold. The climber is gaining momentum right now by swinging and also when doing so, the climber was constantly adjusting the grips. This is important. The climber secures the grips before committing onto the dynamic move. As the climber brings his center of gravity low, he's aiming at the hold of distance by making eye contact. It's important that he does so while building up on the momentum of the swing. This is because the climber will have to launch himself over to the hold and needs to make sure he gets to select which area of the hold he will make the hand placement as well. When the climber is ready, he will engage into a forceful pull and push down on the feet to bring his center of gravity close to the wall by bringing the chest forward against the wall. Now the climber pushing on the left foot will help him gain direction to stay underneath the hold and over going slightly to the right side. And eventually when the climber is gaining height, he will push onto the right foot in order to boost the jump. As we can see the climber was able to stabilize himself from swinging continuing to tighten up his body and at this moment the climber is glancing over to hold that distance since it's very difficult to do when the climber is swinging and it's important that he brings his center of gravity underneath his area of support before making the next move. In this case, the climber now's center of gravity is past the area of support. He has to send the left hand to bring himself to recover the move. So it's important that the climber continues to force the core to be tightened and try to pull himself in as he will continue to swing out. The climber is able to send the left hand up for a match at the jug. He is looking away so that he is able to gain more reach over the left hand placement. The climber must demonstrate control and stability over his body positioning as well as matching the hold. If the climber is able to do this, then the climb is completed. Here the climber was able to sustain onto that underhand onto the lip of the hold and has brought his center of gravity close to the wall, this one being on the core. And underhand placements are really strong as the climber is able to place the hand above him when his center of gravity was low by pulling away on the wall and it gets stronger when the climber gains height as he's able to pull the elbow close to his core once making a solid foot placement. Now the climber is sending the right hand over to the hole that reach, placing the hand over the corner top of the hold. The climber will be going out on the swing due to the right foot being engaged, pushing his center of gravity away from the wall. However, the climber was able to secure the right hand placement by wrapping the fingers around the thick edge of the hold and must create friction to catch by closing the grip. It's good that the climber secures the hand placement before he drops the weight. Dropping the weight will come into place once the climber gets to line up his center of gravity underneath his right hand placement. As he's going onto the swing, the climber is also bringing the left hand to bring it over to match the dining hold, which will help the climber support the swing by pulling in. Once the climber's center of gravity starts being pushed away, it's important that he tries to keep a body tension, mostly on the upper body, engaging in a slight pull up to pull himself in and tightening up the core so he doesn't get to swing out completely. The climber brought the right hand over too much at the same lip where the left hand is and The climber is now making an adjustment of the left hand to come as an under hand over the top edge of the hold This is preparing himself ahead of time For when making the right foot placement too soon once the climber makes that right foot placement He will gain height and at that point having both hands onto the same edge will be difficult to sustain as When the climber is just singing to the bottom edge She will have to be below the hold but in this case if he's going to be gaining height after making the height foot position then ideally would be that the climber sustains to the top area of the hold The climbers hand placement starts at a two hole start. This one each hand has its own hold and both of them are rounded with a hole in the inside of the hold. These ones are called donuts so the climbers able to slide the fingers all the way at the inside of the hold. This one as is with a groove in that area the climber can place the fingertips and squeeze onto the hold as he's able to place the thumbs on the outside of the hold in order to secure the grip. The climber once does it he will be able to lean back trusting on the grips in order to transfer over the weight. Also the climber has brought the feet onto placement the left foot is on a small foot hold and the right foot is on a larger hold where the climber is able to surface the front area of his shoe towards the flat surface of the hold. Since the climber is no longer in the mat and the climb will start. Because the climber was able to bring both of the hands at a match, he sensed the left foot to come into place at the large hold. Now the climber is pushing away from the hold in order to keep his center of gravity below his aerial reach. As the climber needed to gain height in this instance, he has pushed away in the hold as well as pulled himself tightly trying to lock the move. In this instance to send the left hand over to the next hold. This one is a promising hold as the climber has a deep area where the climber can place the fingertips behind the edge of the hold and can sustain it also by pressing on the thumb to secure the grip. As for his body positioning, we can see how his right leg has been extended. This is called flagging out and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place as well as keeping his right side towards the wall to keep his center of gravity underneath the top area of support. For performing the canvassing movement, it's not only that the climber engages in the pull-up, but also he takes advantage of the momentum on his body moving. So in this case, when the climber's body is moving out to the right, he is able to engage in a pull so he can transfer over the left hand to come into a match. Once the climber is airborne, there is going to be a fraction of a second where he's no longer in contact with the wall. This is the moment where he jumps, all of the limbs leave the holds and his right hand is about to come into placement at the hold. In this case, the climber must force the contact of the right hand onto the Dine Hold when having this moment. This moment the climber made a right foot placement and this one being high up the climber then now needs to continue to apply force to the top left hand placement. This one not only he is pulling down on his right hand but this time he is actually pulling away from the wall with the left hand. This one pulling the hold in two different directions so that he's able to secure his movement as he gains height. The next hold is the one distance in which the climber will have to gain sufficient height by fully standing up in order to transition the right hand later on to come into a match at the hold or potentially going up for the reach. The left hand grip the one that is up over underhand this one will need to be sustained when gaining height with the elbow close to the core in order to apply gripping power. At this moment the climber is at mid-jump and we can see how he has pulled himself in, trying to bring the chest as close as he can to the wall, and already has pushed away the left foot from its foothold, sending him already at that direction to stay underneath the hold. As the climber was swinging, he kept adjusting his hand placements. It's important that the climber focuses on making those placements secure before committing onto the dino jump. In this case, the climber is already had swung and right now he's extending his arms to lower his center of gravity and keep the feet above him as he will have to spring out of the move in order to make the hold that reach. As the climber needs to make the hold that reach, it's important that he stares at the hold at distance when positioning his body and while making the swing. The swing was so that the climber is able to gain momentum for when he's ready. He will pull himself forward, bringing the chest towards the wall and he will be pushing down on the feet. The left foot will be used to spring him out over to that direction to stay underneath the hold and then eventually the right foot will be engaged to boost the jump.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So in general he's being very efficient about keeping certain fingers down when he doesn't have to lift them. So that finger independence and that control shows some really good left hand technique. To play this arpeggio pattern, his hand had to shift down the fretboard that direction, and he reached the note accurately, and his finger was in the right spot. As he's playing these arpeggios up and down the fingerboard, he's changing hand positions accurately. However, there are a few notes that he doesn't have the finger pressed down hard enough, so there's a few kind of muted sounds in between some of the notes, but it's not super noticeable. If you look at his left hand here, his fingers are really close to the strings and he's not letting go of his fingers very tall. He's keeping them very close to the strings so he's able to move from note to note with general ease. His left hand shape looks really good. He's using the tips of his fingers, his knuckles are curved, and he's using the right amount of weight to make each note sound clear. He's now playing these chordal patterns in a step-by-step scale motion, and he's playing them with accurate hand shapes, and the strumming pattern sounds really nice as he's playing multiple strings at a time. There's a very noodley quality to the playing that he's doing. The tempo kind of tends to fluctuate. It's not clear if he's trying to play these arpeggios with a really steady beat or if he's trying to just be very casual about whizzing through them. He played all the accurate notes of this scale going up and down the fretboard very easily without making many mistakes changing between different hand positions. Not every note can be heard at the same volume as he's playing these arpeggios. It'd be nicer to hear a more even sound across every single note. As he gets higher, the notes get a little quieter and his fingers aren't quite as coordinated to get that clearer sound as he's going faster. He's using the tips of his fingers to be very precise with each note, and with this finger right here, he actually vibrated it a little bit and wiggled his finger there to warm up the sound at the end, which is nice to hear. As you watch him pick with his right hand, he's alternating. So when he's on the same string, he goes down, up, down, up. And so sometimes he has to change strings, but he keeps that pattern throughout. So every separated note is very distinct and evenly played.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Okay, this is the Mike and drill. It's a drill used for inside players mostly, post players to work on their touch around the basket. In this video, you're going to see the participants start on the right side and then move underneath the basket to the left side. He's shooting with the correct foot, off the correct foot, on the left side using the left hand. He's going to cross over to the right side here. Again, he's going off two feet. You'd like for him to drive off that left foot, kick the right knee up. Again, great touch with the right hand on using the backboard. Definitely better footwork on this drill. You wanna, when you're stepping over to the left side, you wanna step on the right foot and take off that right foot, pulling the left leg up, shooting with the left hand. So on this shot, this frame, the ball goes in the basket, high on the backboard, top of the square, great touch with the left hand, but you'd like to see a little bit more knee lift with that left knee pulling up and elevating on the shot. He's gonna cross. He's looking like he's shooting more of a hook shot, however. I'd like to see that right shoulder square up to the basket a little bit more. So it's more face on shooting where he's got the right arm in facing the basket. Like both shoulders need to be facing that backboard. He's definitely shooting a hook shot. Some people do the Mike and drill that way. I've taught it more as a shot where you're both shoulders square to the backboard. Again, more aggressiveness, more intensity when crossing over from side to side. He's kind of just walking through it, going off two feet. You want to see more of a one-foot takeoff with elevation and pulling of that knee up on the same side as the hand that's shooting the basketball.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So I would encourage them to think about is it like a gliding waltz or is it more of a rhythmic kind of internal bounce like a jig that's happening. So getting a one and chord with this dynamic quality will also help the partners cut across and ease through space. This arm connection here is super important. That, again, we talk about pressure of the pushing and pulling. By flicking their wrists or pressing their wrists out one way, it tells the dancer which way to go. So it's really important that the dancer executes this power and dynamic quality in order to guide their partner around the space. I would encourage the dancers to make sure that they have a stronger frame. Notice how their arms are down. So really to lift those arms and have this kind of wide frame and base to work from. So they create kind of a trapezoid or a parallelogram with their arms and kind of have this strong base with arms connected up top. Or it would be more like this, connected through the top. Right now by having the arms so low, we don't know which way they're going and it's hard for a partner to guide the other person on which way to step. Overall, I would encourage these partners to really think about weight shifting and the pushing and pulling of two opposite sides of a pendulum, kind of like a seesaw, right? And how that moving together, pushing out and then coming in and pushing out again, creates momentum of movement. So if they were to go out to each side versus when they come in close, like how they are now, how can they do that by using resistance and weight shifts and also by engaging that core and taking very precise and big steps. I would encourage dancers, they're pretty grounded right now, but I would encourage the dancer to really engage their core and rotate those shoulders forward, up and back in order to have more precision and power throughout their movement. Notice how the dancer's arm is kind of low here. What they need to do is lift that elbow up. And even though it can still, arm could still be under the armpit here, but this arm should be, this dancer's arm should be resting on top of the dancer's arm in the green shorts. So one arm is underneath the other. So one arm is underneath the other. So if this is the person's body, right? And this is the other person's body, the arm should be underneath the other arm. And then that arm should rest on top. So it kind of lifts both arms up and they create this kind of box shape that I was talking about a little bit earlier. So then they can have power and strength to be able to push and pull and guide. Right now, it's hard for the dancer, the shorter dancer to know where they're being guided to because they don't have any pressure telling them where to go. And it should be a respectful pressure. It should be a strategic technical dance pressure that they feel on their body, not a painful pressure.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So she is in this nice balanced position, you know, both hands are on this hold, but she needs to stay sucked under the wall. Cause now you can see her body's coming out away from the wall, which is causing her to pull up. You can see her arms are quite engaged, but the further left she gets, this sloping hold, it's going to be harder to stay on. Whereas if she's kind of below it and sucked underneath it, her arms are straight and she's kind of pulling straight through it and her body position's creating a lot more friction for her to stay on. So again on this attempt, she looks strong starting it. She hits it again left-handed. And she is able to get her left hand on it as well. So she is able to match it briefly. So I like this back leg so she's right hand, right foot on. Instead of bringing the left hand up, she does this back leg so that toe is kind of digging and keeping tension and it's keeping her balanced. So now she's kind of got this kind of wide stance, this big triangle as a base. And that's going to let her bounce out. Doing that back leg is going to let her bounce out so she can get that left hand up. And this is especially valuable on a hold like this because it's so flat. She wants as much of her body below the hold because the further away from the wall she is, the more she's going to pull in. And with these flat holds, there's not a whole lot of grip so you kind of want to let the friction and let your body position aid as much as possible.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So just making sure you're hitting the bag boy high and soft in order to be able to give yourself a better chance at making the layup. And also there's no dribbling. There's no rhythm in the attempt of trying to make the layup. So this is also causing her to be off track. It's causing her to not have that type of fluency into the motion of going to make the layup. The first issue is what's the concept? Is she trying to make a layup? Is she trying to make a reverse layup? So just understanding the concept of what she's attempting to do first and foremost. I think need to be established on this first initial clipboard. I think this angle here just shows right trying to make a layup from straight on is really tough Her posture is going straight forward. She has no angle at coming in To make that layup neither does she have any English on the spin and this is gonna make it even tougher Almost like a zero zero chance at making it The angle she's also taking is super flat. She wanted to be able to come down from a high angle to give herself a better chance at making this layup. And also just understanding if you're going to come off two feet, be able to have that flexion and try to release it at the peak of your jump. She's hitting the backboard really, really hard and obviously she's hitting it outside of the white box, which means she's going to have less of a chance at making the shot. So take a little bit off. You want the ball to hit the backboard as it's going down, not as it's going up.

So he's going to want his arm bent and really engaged. That way he can kind of pull into it, get his left hand on there as well. Because that's just going to help him hold the swing. So I can't say maybe he has a first step down and that's, you know, hitting the hold. Second step would be holding the hold. A little better. Maybe getting the left hand on.

The player has executed a double scissor, scissor in right, scissor in left, but at the end does not change direction at all. So we would like the player to scissor right to get the defender to go right, scissor left to get the defender to go left, and then when the defender is off balance change direction and head in the opposite direction to the defender is leaning. The player has maintained close control of the ball throughout this last sequence. You can see the ball is in frame in at least this arc at all times. This helps them manipulate the ball better than if the ball was further away in this type of arc. Players executed a little L turn where the ball goes behind the standing leg and out the other way. We'd want the touch now though to be with the outside of the left foot and to continue on in this direction for the next dribbling section. The player has begun a roll over action. I like the distance that they've got here. Really balanced on the right leg. Reaching for the ball with the left foot as far as they can. This adds a lot more deception in the actual moment within the game. The player is trying to execute a little Cruyff type action, however he's made contact with the ball, the ball hasn't really gone anywhere, the ball contact needs to be hard enough so that it pushes the ball back out of his body so that he can then load up the left leg and push away. Players use the inside of their foot instead of the outside. This inside touch has actually brought the ball more narrow when because he was using the alternative beat an opponent we would want him to be going away from that opponent and not back into him. Players dribble has taken three or four or five touches in this area. Every time the ball has stayed close to the body and he's never had to reach for it. Keeping the ball this close helps the player continue to make actions and in a game makes it more difficult for the ball to be stolen from him by a defender. The player is trying to execute a little L-turn with the inside of his right foot. He's moved his left foot too quickly. The ball needed to be rolling a little bit faster so that it cleared this left foot before it moved back. Because the ball hasn't been hit with enough pace and the left foot has moved too quickly, the outcome is this little back heel contact that the player doesn't want. That's going to send the ball behind him and ultimately lose possession. The player has now been able to go into an inside Cruyff, so reversing the ball back across their body, linking the rollover and this action together is impressive for this player. This is a good action. The ball's rolling across the player's body. He's shifted his body weight to the right, loading up his right leg, and is now unloading and pushing his body weight to the right. These two body feints would give the defender really an issue, something to think about, because the fake makes it look like they're going either right or left. Players execute a scissor with their right foot. This is good timing here. Balls rolling at a good speed and the timing of their action to bring their right foot around the ball and plant us was really good. The player has selected a roll over action with the right foot in this moment. However, he's rolling the ball into the corner, an area of less space, and therefore is reducing his time and making the situation more difficult for himself. The scissor action was good but there was no change of direction at the end. We would want the player after the final action of leaning to the left to push the ball away with the outside of their right foot and change speeds to get away from their opponent. So as he's rolled the ball with the left foot, he's managed to plant the left foot quickly. At the same time as the left foot was planting, his right leg moves in behind him. So he maintains the kind of natural left-right, left-right gait. Now the player is loaded up on the left leg, the ball is still rolled across and is now in the perfect position for him to take the ball away with the right foot, really like this. The ball has got stuck under the players feet, you can see how both feet, legs and knees are together. This isn't good for balance and it certainly doesn't allow him to change direction with any speed or explosive power. The ball is really stuck under the body, so in order to move forward the player is going to get the ball out before they can continue on with the dribbling action. Players execute with a small L turn, put their right foot on top of the ball, drag it behind their standing left leg, and then in the same touch, move the ball back across that standing left leg so they can continue the action. They've done this in good control of the ball, eyes on the ball, it's a good action.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

You'll see his arm is quite aggressively Being used and it's on this kind of slopey pinch guy So it's gonna be extra hard to kind of make the move with just the arm So here we can see him setting this heel hook and that's gonna let him just kind of take a little bit more of the weight to his hands, but I think in order to make the heel hook effective is first grabbing it this this pinch on the left side because now The only open spot is on the left side so he's gonna have to cross it kind of under with his right arm pinch To then move up to the left So it's gonna make the sequence a little bit harder and harder to kind of share that hold and pull from that hold But overall the heel looks a nice idea because it's gonna Let him kind of pull straight down through the hold and it's gonna free up that right arm to do whatever it needs to do Okay, so here he's starting pretty straight armed, but his feet are kind of bunched up so he could kind of flag the right foot out a little bit to provide some counterbalance for when he reaches up with his left hand. So that would kind of look the opposite of what his left hand is doing since he's kind of pulling down with the right arm, toeing down to the left with the left foot. So he's nice and opposite opposed and isn't fighting the position too much. Then he attempts to kind of resituate his grip on this pinch, but just is unable to do so. And then just even to just kind of gasses himself out. I think he then attempts to set a heel hook, which is a good move as well. So by staying opposite of pose, you can kind of stay square to the wall, balance out, keep a little tension, and then bump that left hand up to that pinch. He does a nice little foot swap on this foot, kind of going up the right foot to it first instead of just cutting feet. He gets his one foot up so he can keep tension, then matches the foot, flicks the other foot up to kind of get this left-handed hold again.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Again, I think that he should be using a measuring spoon so he is not over or under seasoning his dish. Here you can see that he is swirling the oil across the entire surface of the pan so that there are no parts of the pan that haven't been touched by the oil. This is again so that he can be certain that the egg does not stick. He successfully flips the omelette over in about a minute and a half after cooking on the first side. The remaining side should only cook for about 30 seconds more for the omelette to be fully cooked through. Next step is to prepare his pan and here he is cutting the electric stove on medium-high heat. He has selected a small omelet pan or skillet to use for this recipe. Once his vegetables are chopped, he does stand up and lift his cutting board off of the table and walks it over to the bowl of eggs that have already been mixed and efficiently he is moving the cut vegetables from the cutting board to the mixing bowl with his knife while his left hand holds the cutting board at a 45 degree angle. He takes a handful of pre-sliced onion, I don't know if this was sliced prior to the video or if it was purchased this way, and begins to dice it. His next step is whisking the eggs together, which he does with this with the same fork. This is an appropriate tool for this particular task. You could also use a wire whisk. He stirs it all to combine and he sprinkles it with what I believe to be a little bit of salt. Obviously I would recommend he use a measuring spoon here so he knows exactly how much seasoning he is adding to his dish. He grabs a very small pepper from this bag, produce bag, and begins to thinly slice it after sitting back down. I do think that one of the challenges that he's having with using his knife is because he is seated instead of standing. He does fold the omelet in half, which is actually a classic way of serving the omelet. At this point the omelet is cooked though, so he should remove it from the pan and put it on his serving plate. Using this thin curved spatula, otherwise known as a fish spatula, he is going around the outside of the omelette to make sure that the edges are not sticking. Here you can see he gives it a little bit of a shake. This is to ensure that the edges are not sticking and to try to get the omelette in a single even layer so that it cooks evenly. And this pressing motion that he's doing is not actually really cutting, he's just randomly chopping away at the onions in order to try to get them into smaller pieces. He puts his hand directly over the pan's surface so that he can tell if it's hot enough. He could also do this by sprinkling a little bit of water from the tap into the pan and if it sizzles that means that it is ready. The first step in cooking an omelette is to gather all of your ingredients and the tools that you will need to complete the recipe from start to finish. You can see here that he has a mixing bowl set aside, a cutting board, and a knife back here at his workspace. He adds about a tablespoon of canola oil directly to the pan. Again, he should be measuring this. However, he could use any type of oil, butter, or pan spray. This is in an effort to ensure that when he adds the omelet to the pan, it does not stick to the bottom. I can't be certain what that last seasoning was, but again, he should be measuring these ingredients instead of just eyeballing it. The last step is to transfer the omelette from his skillet into onto the serving platter, which he does here with relative ease. You can see here that his knife skills are below average. He doesn't have a very clear understanding of the most efficient or effective technique to do this task. He has his index finger out on the blade of the knife to balance it, I guess. You should always hold the handle of the knife like you would just a normal handle, not with your finger out. And then also his left hand, he has all of his fingers out trying to guide the onion towards the knife. He is obviously putting himself in danger of injury if the knife should slip. He adds his omelet mixture directly to the pan when he feels that it is hot enough. Once that task is complete, he is ready to prep his vegetables. It is strange that he is sitting down while doing this task. It would be preferable to be standing at a countertop or a different workspace, not seated in a chair. He flips it one or two more times. I don't know if this is just for color or if it's because he is unsure of actually when the omelet is done, but it's fully cooked now. He cracks open a single egg with the edge of a fork and with his two thumbs spreads the egg directly into the mixing bowl.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

So here we have a start position matched on this rail hold that's also a pinch. High left foot. Looks like the right foot is on something down here on the kicker. You'll see the climber is actually half crimping the left hand, utilizing the thumb actually on the surface of the hold, as well as a pinch with the right. So the pinch is going to allow for optimal control of this hold and is the primary grip for this start position, whereas this half crimp is going to allow the climber to pull diagonally and progress up and left on this boulder. And matching feet again, you see the climber coming up to this lateral pinch, which looks very slopey, quite difficult. You can even just see the grimace on the climber's face here. This super low foot requiring a ton of tension and making the climber have to put a ton of weight into this right hand as well, because this left hand seems pretty useless.

So really thinking about when is a good moment to use that, right? Especially when they're moving a little bit slower and flowing from their torso into their fingertips. Notice how the dancer is more grounded so they are able to create to move through very quickly all of this advanced choreography and these steps to the side. I would encourage the dancer to think about engaging that core because they're doing a lot of great work in their legs and in their arms and even in their head. But engaging that core would give them even more stability as they move. I would encourage the dancer to one, immediately not look at the floor, to not break up their alignment, to look forward, to look forward and raise their chin. I would encourage the dancers to think about their fingertips. So often they have, again, power through their arms, but sometimes the detail is lost in the fingertips as we're trying to move really quickly. I would encourage the dancer to breathe and have breath even though this movement is really, really fast, creating moments of suspension as opposed to moments of always staccato, staccato, staccato or hit, hit, hit, hit, hit creates a more dynamic quality.

He should be extending it with more energy. His arm should be straight at some point and have energy through his fingers. His fingers are a bit dead here. There's not energy radiating outward. So if he is gonna accentuate his arm like that and emphasize it by extending forward, he really does then need to fully engage and use his energy to extend his arm forward. The way in which his chin is placed here now when he's looking straight forward is much better. Now his spine is vertically aligned with his head upright. He barely sees the floor in the screen. He sees much more of the rest of the room including the curtain and higher. This is where his eye focus should be. The dancer has a moment in which he gazes downward here. He sees a bunch of the floor in the screen. His head should be upright, his chin should be picked up, and he should be focusing straight forward. This is another opportunity here when the dancer is doing these steps in place for him to be engaging his hips and moving them sideways. It is okay for the dancer to extend his arm forward here in this punch position when he's stepping Forward right before he does a revolution around It's just once he finishes that turn. He shouldn't be then extending continue to extend his arm in this up punching position The dancer extends his right arm forward here a bit of a punch position, which is awkward. It's not necessary His arms shouldn't be extended forward like this. They should be bent inward And alternating one higher and lower not extended forward like this The dancer isn't really lifting his feet here. He's barely picking them off the floor, sometimes not picking them off the floor at all, so he should articulate his footwork more here by picking his feet off the floor. He doesn't need to be marching by any means, but his feet should be lifted and then placed back onto the floor. This is really good shoulder movement here, how he's accentuating his shoulder with each foot tap he does forward. It'd be wonderful if he continued to engage his shoulders like this and even more movement because this mobility here is very good. He does this once again now, looking downward instead of straight outward. This is a habit he has whenever he's extending his leg out to the side. That first step of the sequence of three steps when he steps out to the side, then to the center, and then cross. That very first step, stepping out to the side, he has this habit of looking downwards during. He should make sure to keep his chin at level and looking straight forward. The dancer also doesn't move his hips or engage his hips here. He should be moving his hips horizontally right and left with each step that he takes.

Now in this case climber generated so much power and coordination from down below where once generated the power the climber had a huge swing. This is a bit difficult as the climber you know if there is a big swing then the climber will not be able to hold on to the hold above. So it's important to know how much of power the climber is generating before getting on to the hold. As this is a dynamic movement the climber needs to make an efficient movement and also make it less physical or taxing. In this case this made climber potentially not being able to grip the hold enough due to the power generated on the swing. Here we can see the climber rocking back and forth and this so that the climber can secure the feet and also generate power when making the movement up from the pull up to the next move up. Now the climber right now when rocks back and forth is transferring weight first to the right foot that is placed the highest and then when the climber is down below it uses the left foot and then once the climber gets to stand up and create a dynamic move up to the next hold the climber will be pressing down on the left foot first and then bringing his hips over the highest foot being the right then to move up their hand as they stand up on the right foot. Here's a point of the climber to visualize the wall before starting the climb. Now we can see the climber performing some hand gestures, which this will help the climber have an idea of what the sequence of his hands movements will be when on the wall. Here we can see the climber going up for a dyno. This is where the climber needs to really make a commitment on knowing exactly where the hold is going to be held. This one in this case the climber thought of the right hand going up and exactly wanting to place the hand where he has it. Now the dynamic move comes out with a lot of force as the climber was squatting transferring the weight from the foot left to right and once the climber was ready by doing a sprint up to the hold the climber once gets to stick the hand onto the hold then the body will dynamically want to pendulum out of the wall due to the force. So the climber in order to sustain the grip will must to is not only create pressure generated from the open hand grip that the climber has in this moment but it would also need to bring their chest forward and try to use your core to bring their feet back onto the wall to avoid peeling off the wall. Here we can see the climber starting at a two-hold start hold. Each hand has a donut, is a type of hold that the climber is holding on to, and to create pressure the climber is pinching it using all of their hand to create the pinch. The climber also needs to generate a lot of power while hanging on to it and does this by leaning back. Also leaning back is called the rest position and can help the climber keep power or not get so tired when having the arms extended and only engaging the grips as the climber makes the placement onto the wall for the feet. Now once the feet are on the wall and the climbers off the mat then the climber starts.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

On the right hand he's holding on to a pinch so he has to aim the elbow away to the right side since the climber is standing right underneath the grips. Simpsons the climber was struggling on the grips and reason why the climber hasn't stepped off from the wall. The climber was going to do this again. He needs to make sure that he aims where the next move will be and as the left hand is placed as a mono, the climber is keeping the left hand as an undercling which this can be a powerful grip and in order to keep it in place the climber then eventually will have to bring the elbow close to the core when making the stance up to the next move. Heel hooks are powerful and as we can see the climber was able to engage into a forceful stance. This one engaging all of the standing power onto that right heel being placed. Once the climber was able to bring his center of gravity as close as he can to his right foot being the area of support, the climber also engages in a forceful pull up. This is called a lock off. In order for the climber to keep himself in that position, his left leg is extended behind the right leg being in position. The climber is tapping the toe against the wall. This is to sustain position while making the reach. As this was a wide hand placement, we can see the climber securing the grip on the left hand on a jug, meaning that the climber is able to place the fingers inside the hold, being able to have a positive grip, pulling away from the hold to create pressure. Now, the climber glances down at the feet because he must do a foot switch. Now, because the left leg being up kept the climber too cramped over, so in order to release some pressure down at the feet, the climber must pull tight on the grips. And the climber needs to make a quick foot switch because of the crunched up position, but also needs to make sure he is applying pressure with the foot coming in before he releases the left foot out of place. The climber is starting at a one hand hold start. As we see, both hands are placed onto the same hold and this is called matching. The climber is starting on a sit start, meaning that this will add a grade to the climb, since sit starts are difficult to come up from because the climber, once places the feet on the wall, he will need to raise his hips, applying weight into the limbs. Now that the climber has secured the grip on the right hand, the climber keeps the arm extended. This creates some pressure at the grips. The climber then brings the left foot to come into place to the area of where the heel hook is placed. It's important that the climber releases the heel hook with control as they create a lot of pressure on the pull and it's acting as a third hand in this instance. So the climber once creates pressure with the toe being in place into the hold, the climber is able to release the right foot from place. The climber quickly has made the right foot to come up to a higher stance. This one by placing the heel in first against the wall. The climber places it also above the edge of the whole foothold. In this case the climber is going glancing over to the next hold. So in order to make this reached move the climber is extending the arms to bring it to a rest and it's important the climber knows how to grip and hold position before committing to the move. As the left leg is extended, fold it behind it, hold behind the right leg. This is called flagging which the climber will then tap the toe in order to keep himself in position once he is up for the stance. While the climber was sustaining the jog with the match, the climber had blindly made a foot switch. This by making a feel of the left foot coming into place next to the right toe and quickly has placed the right foot onto a higher stance. Sending the heel into the wall so that the climber is able to use it as a heel hook for the next move. As we can see, the climber is making some hand gestures. This is because the climber is visualizing the wall. And creating the hand gestures will help the climber have an idea on what to expect on sequence when making the moves before getting onto the wall. It's important that the climber continues to pull on the monohull in order to create pressure. Right now the climber needs to glance over at the feet to fix the stance, as the climber will need to continue the rest of the climb, and keeping the arms bended for a long period of time can tire the climber's grip. As we can see the climber releases the right hand to bring it over to a match at the jug. For foot placement the climber has sent the left leg to be extended and this one is used for him to flagging in and has tapped the toe against the wall so that he can keep position when making the transfer of the hand over to the next grip. Here we can see how the climber is off to a start. This is because his body is no longer on the mat. As we can see the climber is glancing over to the left side and in order for him to achieve going out left he will have to send his left hand out for the next hold. For him to get direction the climber must sustain the left foot in place being the highest one and would have to keep a wide stance when making the move out left. To support the direction of the move the climber will have to press down on the right foot against the wall and extend the leg to support the reach. The climber here is shaking his hands. This will help the climber release any tension that has been built up. Also, shaking them will help the climber to have a slight warm up and regain energy for the climber to have a better grip when on the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So here she's doing kind of a little chasse, so kind of like a gallop forward and back with the kick and then a ball change step back. I think finally by this point she is getting the rhythm of it. She's doing a pretty decent job staying on the beat. But really again committing to the step and not trying to cut any step off but doing the step fully so her body can fully just understand what she's trying to do. And again I would say as some sort of arms the upper body is still very stiff to match the movement of the legs. The dancer starts with rock step, triple step, triple step, and she's doing it around in a circle. Right at the moment right before this freeze, she kind of stumbled a little bit. And I think it's because her body appears very tense. So really in this swing era, like loosening up your body, letting everything go would help a lot. And just letting your upper body naturally do what it's going to do in reaction to your feet. She does do a good job moving around the space, but getting flustered and mixed up is I think it's because she's not letting go of her body and just trusting the steps. Because she's repeating the steps over and over again. So just really trusting your body and doing what it's going to do. So here she's doing again just the rock step triple step and I think she's getting off the timing because her energy is not staying consistent with the music so she kind of builds her energy up I think would help her to not get off beat so much and she would just really stay on the beat if she just brought up a little bit more energy. I also feel like she's really heavy on her feet so I would suggest maybe pushing up on her toes a little bit more to be a little bit lighter bending her knees a little bit more when she is doing the triple steps because it does feel like she's just really heavy and weighted to the floor.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The violinist can just practice very slowly to make sure that they know where their fingers are going. They can also practice with the tuner to help see if they're in tune or not. This chord that they're playing starts really crunchy because their weight in their hand is not all the way down to pull down the strings. The violins are getting a really nice sound because they're keeping their bows straight in parallel with the bridge. This is another example that they're playing with their pads of their fingers. If they used more of their fingertips, they'd get more clarity in this section. Right now it sounds a bit muddy. The violinist isn't getting the most clarity here. They're playing with flat fingers. This also is affecting their intonation a bit. If they can play with their fingertips, they'll get more clarity and have more accuracy with their left hand. When playing this note, the violinist has this approach that they're coming from above, and it doesn't sound super coordinated. It'd be best, even for a split second, to put the hair on the string first, and then pull the bow. If they were playing on the pad of their finger, they could get more clarity in their sound if they played more on the fingertip. The violins are doing a gliss slide with their finger, keeping the string as they go down. Stylistically, they could make it a little bit more longer and gooier to make it seem more romantic. There's a brief scratch in the sound because the left hand and the right hand are not coordinated. The left hand should be leading to make sure that the string is down and then the bow can follow. This is another example for these shorter notes, that the violins is using too much bow. They can have a more compact amount of bow, and they'll have more clarity for these smaller notes. These fast notes would have come across a little bit clearer if they used a smaller amount of bow, so it's more condensed. They missed the shift here. In order for it to be better, they can just practice going from their current position to their past position multiple times to really measure the shift and feel comfortable with the hand is going. The violinist is able to do this exercise decently well, but it would serve them well to slow this down and be very aware of their finger motions. This note isn't in tune. The player can use a tuner to help get a better idea of the right pitch. When performing this technical exercise, it's really important to have curved fingers so you're really playing with the fingertip. The violinists could get better clarity if they were able to do this. This phalanx is doing a good job playing closer to the frog. In order to get there, they're also utilizing their upper arm, bringing it a little bit over, so that they can play with more weight, especially on the G-string. This section is losing a little bit of its clarity. You can see that they're using the pads of their fingers. Perhaps if they brought their elbow just a little bit further around, they can get more on their fingertips to get more clarity. They're doing a really nice job of this section using a full amount of bow to get the best sound also while traversing all these string crossings. This note, they could have actually launched the note a little bit sooner here for more of a stylistic approach. For these shorter notes, the violinist is using too much bow. If they used lesser amount of bow, it would be better for coordination between the left hand and the right hand. The violinist is still playing with some flat fingers, more on the pad. If they can play more with their fingertips, they'll be able to enter the string faster and leave it faster, which will result in more clarity and better coordination. They're getting a really excellent sound by having the bow being parallel with the bridge. They're also using a nice balance of weight and speed to get the string to ring. Here's another example with these fast ones that they're playing the left hand, that they could use a smaller amount of bow for it to come across more clearly. When playing on the E string, they're doing a good job of utilizing their forearm and opening up from their elbow.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

You can see the left hand fingers are curved and pressing firmly in the frets, and they are playing with great pitch and rhythmic accuracy. The guitarist is performing this scale pattern with great rhythmic and pitch accuracy at a consistent tempo. Each pitch is sounding nice and clear. The guitarist is continuing to curve their left hand fingers and press firmly on the strings and towards the center of each fret that is needed to play the pitches in this pattern. Here the placement of the left hand pinky could be adjusted again. It is pressing on top of the metal bar and should be pressing more towards the center of the fret to get a clearer sound. Here the pitch played by the pinky was a bit muted and not as clear as it could be as the pinky was released a little bit too quickly. It could have been planted more firmly for a bit longer to get a clearer sounding pitch. They are now performing the same major scale in two octaves with a different articulation. They are playing their notes staccato or more short and separated. Here, a pitch was skipped at first. The guitarists quickly pressed their pinky down and played the pitch that was missing before playing this pitch with their second finger again to correct this mistake. They again increase their tempo and are playing with great pitch and rhythmic accuracy and also a clear tone quality. Even at this fast challenging tempo, they are playing their pattern repeatedly and accurately. The aim of the right hand fingers is great. The guitarist is doing an excellent job at playing their finger style pattern at a very fast, rapid tempo. The guitarist is reattempting this scale again. You can see this time their left hand fingers are more curved when playing the descending portion of this major scale which is helping them to play each of their pitches with a clear tone. The guitarist is doing a great job playing their repeating finger style pattern. The right hand fingers are playing each string individually. They're not bumping into any extra strings, so they are getting a nice clear sound to each pitch and the right hand fingers are curved while playing this pattern. The guitarist is performing a major scale in two octaves. They did a great job shifting to the higher frets on the fretboard and they are getting a nice clear sound quality. You can see their left hand fingers are curved and pressed towards the center of the frets and the left thumb is on the back of the neck of the guitar. The guitarist is performing their arpeggios. They are shifting to different spots on the fretboard and from one chord to another very easily. They are continuing to produce a clear sound due to their excellent left hand position. The fingers are curved and pressing firmly towards the center of the frets that are needed. The guitarist is performing a different major scale. You can see they are continuing to demonstrate excellent left hand position. The left hand fingers are curved over the fretboard. The thumb is on the back of the neck of the guitar. The guitarist is continuing to play their alternating strumming pattern accurately. They are alternating between using the pointer finger and the middle finger to play each pitch in the scale. The last two pitches that were performed were also muted. You can see that the pointer finger on the left hand is pressing directly on this metal bar, which is affecting the sound quality. It would help to press this finger more towards the center of the fret and curve it a bit more to get clearer sound. It would also help to curve and press the second finger down more towards the center of its fret to get a clearer sound on that pitch as well. They are continuing to shift to the higher frets with ease and they are continuing to get a nice clear Beautiful sound quality even on these higher pitches that are being played here They are now performing their same scale with a legato articulation again, but at a much faster tempo.

So here we have the climber just past the first move In my opinion, this is where the boulder probably could have just started They just do a pretty simple move off of this jug and then move into this jug This is sort of a route setting preference, but they are in my opinion in the start of the boulder The climber then gets a heel on the start hold and does this nice lock off on this jug and reaches up and is able to get into this decent looking hold here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

His feet are moving efficiently, but they're not quite moving with the rhythm underneath him. They're kind of moving in a very pedestrian, almost kind of confused manner. If you were to be able to find more clarity in this transition, by keeping his movements small and tight and really paying attention to the rhythm and the music, he would be able to execute it more efficiently. As the dancer performs some jumping variations of the Charleston, he continues to struggle keeping the arms engaged and the upper body engaged. Overall, his upper body appears quite stiff and kind of locked in position. His lower body is able to move freely and execute the step. However, he really loses his connection to the rhythm as he performs this bigger movement as compared to the rock step and the triple step prior. So if he were to keep his jumps a little bit smaller and find some more clarity in the working leg, particularly during those kicking movements, he would be able to connect more deeply to the rhythm and maintain that connection to the music. The dancer is starting to find more movement in his arms here, however his movement in his arms appears to be mimicking that of if he had a partner. So for example if he was dancing with another person here, he appears to reach his arm out in a way that's characteristic of holding hands with a partner in dancing. Which shows that he has an understanding of the movement technique, however he doesn't have the advanced knowledge of the movement to be able to choreograph arms for a solo performance. He's really leaning on what probably he might know prior to this, which is a partner performance. So he would benefit from finding more clarity as a soloist, particularly in the movement of his arms here. As the dancer starts to find more confidence in his movements, particularly as he's changing facings, he's able to connect slightly to the rhythm here and he's able to find a lot more clarity in his lower body, particularly in the movement of his feet and also the facing of his body overall. Where he would benefit here is from adding some more arm choreography. The arms have stayed pretty stagnant throughout the entire performance, as well as his upper body. He's quite stiff through the shoulders and the back. If he were to add some more choreography, particularly in the upper body, and loosen up that pelvis a little bit, he would be able to execute the choreography more fully, as well as with a little bit more efficiency and connection to the music. As the dancer is performing a series of basic rock steps and triple steps, which is characteristic of swing dance movement, he is able to really catch the rhythm in the triple steps in particular. However, he's struggling to move through his rock steps as quickly as the music might call for. He would just benefit from some more clarity and some more efficiency in his movement. As the dancer is continuing to perform a series of basic steps, he starts to get really, really thrown off both the music and the technical elements of the step. He appears to be performing a series of shuffles where he's taking his feet from this wide stance and bringing them in closer together in more of a scooting or a chugging motion rather than defining that rock step and the triple step movement. He would benefit from overall just finding more clarity in his movement here, taking a moment to breathe and refocus his energy because right now his movement feels very sporadic, it feels a little bit all over the place and it feels like it's lacking that technical clarity. As the dancer is performing these series of kicks that are somewhat similar to a Charleston, but also somewhat freestyle here, he's really struggling with his directionality and finding a lot of clarity in his movement. And he's struggling with this because this working leg that's performing the kicks is really leading the movement, rather than his torso and his pelvis leading the movement. He's letting his leg really take that energy so that he shifts facings from one direction to another, rather than leading with his torso to make that shift, which is throwing him off the music quite significantly and making his movements appear very reactionary, rather than as one cohesive performance. If he were to really utilize his torso and clarify his movements in his lower body, he would be able to connect more deeply to the music, as well as execute the step more efficiently. As the dancer is continuing to perform a series of basic swing movements, he's able to execute the movements fairly efficiently through his lower body, though he could use some refinement and some more deep embodiment of the rhythm. However, his upper body feels pretty stagnant. He would benefit from some added arm choreography. You can see his arms are just kind of tightly positioned and bent close to the torso. And his upper body through the shoulders and the spine particularly is quite stiff. If he were to loosen up his upper body a little bit more and incorporate some more specific arm choreography, it would really benefit him.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So overall for a basic choreography, this dancer is able to just do all the steps really cleanly and go through each transition really well, so this is a really good example for basic.

And here they are just kind of walking around each other. The guy in the pink did a little spin and connected hands again and I feel like their feet are a little loud so they can definitely walk a bit softer so they're not quite stomping around. So here they, he's swinging the guy in the black around while still keeping the same correct rhythm. So nice shot there with a nice space in between. The eyes are still connected, which is nice. And also the hands are connected. So here a much better job at coming back together just with some heel steps forward. So the step is leading with the heel of the foot and they are again mirroring each other with the opposite leg. So here they're just kind of doing a bit of side waves of their body moving side to side as they kind of step and move back and forth. So not bad, just more improvised than actual choreography. I think here it's getting a little flustered because they're not quite mirroring each other. They're not quite using the same legs. So this where it looks a bit more improvised. So I think they just kind of need to reconnect and make sure they're stepping together. So here they are stepping together and they look like a mirror so nice job there keeping the beat and moving together. So I think it may help if they talk through the movement so they know what movement is coming next. And I think that would help them to transition better throughout the different movements. So here he's spinning the guy in the black around while still kind of doing this ball change triple step, the rock step triple step, and keeping the rhythm as best as they can.

At that point too, when the movement is, where the arms are here and they're going up and down, I'd like to see the arms moving more like this, back and forth, rather than the arms moving more like this, up and down. Because the movement should really come from the shoulders. That comes from the center of the body. It really shouldn't be a hand gesture or an arm gesture, but more about the torso moving the shoulders there. Because the shoulders are actually what we wanna see in the isolations. It's not a hand movement or an elbow or an arm movement. The dancers should shift in the hips a little bit more. So if this were the hips, the lower part of the body should be moving, swiveling.

They can move really fast but be in control of their body placement which is super important so they can do this by one grounding of course breath control and engaging their abdominal. I would encourage the dancer to really think about using their hips as well as their rib cage, not just moving from their extremities.

His head, his chin is tilted downward and his eyes are facing downward and he should not be looking downward. He should be looking straight ahead. The dancer is doing a good job of leading his hand to be directly over his partner's vertical spine. So their hands are meeting above her head and not too far in front or behind her head. So that is helpful for his partner to be turning so he's giving a good leading hand there. The dancer is doing a really good job of initiating movements in which his partner moves far away from him and then comes back to him with great ease. And he's doing that by remaining in contact with her through hand grips. So even when they're spreading apart from each other, he's still holding her hand tightly enough to be able to initiate the pull for her to return to him easily. The dancer really is not making eye contact with his partner. He is looking outward towards the majority of the room, but instead the center of his focus should be his partner. The dancer is doing a good job here of bending his knees to quite a large extent for the Suzy Q which is appropriate for this step. You need to bend your knees a lot in order to have the mobility of being able to rotate your legs as well as travel and he is doing that. The dancer does a good job here of lifting his right foot really high off the ground. His heel is almost at hip length and he's bending his right knee extremely here in order to get his heel up that high. So the dancer wearing the glasses that we are analyzing here is a bit taller than his partner. So when he's looking straight ahead he is actually looking beyond his partner. She's shorter than him and it's important in partner work to make eye contact. So he should be looking straight at her which would mean for him he'd have to look slightly on the downward diagonal instead of straight ahead and beyond his partner. The dancer should be bending his knees more here so that going underneath his partner's hand is easier for him, especially since there is a height difference. She can't extend her arm any higher so he needs to compensate for that by bending lower. The dancer is also initiating the partnership to use a large area of the room. Even though he can be taking larger steps, even so, all of his steps are adding up for him to be using all of the space that is at his disposal. The dancer is taking really small movements with his feet. He can articulate his footwork more by taking more concrete steps and making all of his steps bigger.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She reached her hand behind her and then spun out around. And it was just, I could tell they were flowing together, so that was nice. So here with the feet I could tell she as she stepped on her left foot he was not stepping on his right foot so it wasn't really compatible so they both have to mirror each other whenever they come back together in these smaller steps. So in that section, they did a much better job. They weren't quite perfectly in sync, but they were much better at still doing the same rock step together. So good job there with her doing the rock step to full step while spinning out. Again, his movements, I think he could be much lighter on his feet. So as she's really light dancing on the balls of her feet, he should also be just as light. So like here, they are mirroring each other. This leg and this leg are the same, as well as this leg and this leg. So that looks a lot cleaner. So here as I'm walking around, that's much more in sync. He's just walking, just taking one step to walk. So one, two. She's doing like a step, ball, change, step, ball, change. But he's stepping at the same rhythm and pace as her. So it actually matches up well. So here they're just walking around in a circle, staying connected with their hands, but they are together on the same rhythm. So to begin, the dancers are just rocking side to side. They're holding hands here and then holding by the shoulder and waist here. So overall I think they did a pretty good job. This is more, I don't think it's really choreographed, I think it's more improvised in their movements. They do keep good eye contact and you know try their best to remain connected. I just think some of the smaller steps they should be doing the same step so whenever they're supposed to do a rock step, triple step, they should both be doing that step to stay more in sync. So even there, she's doing the rock step, triple step, going that way, and he's just walking. So, if her rhythm is one rock step, triple step, and he's just walk, walk, and not quite on the same beat, then it doesn't really match up. And so it'll allow them to not be able to connect as easily when they separate and come back together. So here when they come back together, he has to make sure he is leading her in her feet and watch to make sure that they are not stepping on top of each other. And it appears they're almost about to step on top of each other as they're circling around. So they just have to be also aware of the spacing and placement of their feet. So here as they start to move, she's doing a rock step, triple step with her feet. He's just kind of stepping side to side, so it's important that they are doing the same steps so they appear more in sync and together. So if he's leading, then she should be following his same movements and vice versa.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This is just some left-right-left movement after the jug, nothing technically demanding of the climber, just pulling and grabbing and moving the left hand and the right hand. Here the climber perches over this left foot and continuing to drive through the right. They find a body position where they're able to, at least for a short time, put their full weight on this right pinch. That allows them to get into this pretty small left-hand crimp here. So we have a left hand on this jug-like hold here. This is a cool start. The climber back steps this orange foothold down here and kind of hops up into this right hand and now they're in the start position of the boulder here. Kramer then bumps up into this undercling and is able to get the right foot up here and the left foot staying where it was. Kramer is able to stand up into that undercling and get a match and top the boulder. And the climber is then able to maintain the same positions and get into this hold first with their right and then match with their left. This is what is known in climbing as a thank you God hold, which is I guess a little bit tongue in cheek, but nevertheless, it's used pretty widely. It's just a really good rest position after a stressful situation before. It's a place where the climber can recollect and set some new intentions if needed. And after getting a higher left foot here, climber is able to lock down this left hand and driving hard through the right foot. And the climber is able to get into this long two foot pinch here.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Again, the hesitation there, the pause will allow a defender in a game situation to match up with you. But this looks good. I get the shooting hand a little bit behind the ball, but I love the soft, token pressure of the guide hand. Again, see the small little steps, he's standing straight up. Let's drop those knees and hips. Great extension, follow through. Let's again spread those fingers. Love the guide hand, palm facing in. Let's get this elbow in. Good extension of the hips. He's going up on the balls of his feet. Would love to see a little more lift from this player. Beautiful extension here. This is really, really good. I might spread those fingers just a tad, get this elbow in, but good extension. He releases the ball at the height of his jump, which is good, and the ball's got some arc on it, which is you want it to go up. Again, he's just standing straight up, just bending the knees and getting ready and meet this pass. Again, he's getting his hands ready, which is really, really good. You know, and then when he does catch it, there's a little bit of a hesitation. You see his feet are kind of close together. You know, in a game, a situation, again, I mean, if you don't catch and get rid of this ball quickly, I mean, it's \u2013 you're not going to get the shot off. So let's be ready. Let's drop those hips, run and catch that \u2013 meet that pass and shot. Again, this is why I gave him a seven or eight. In this drill, ideally, you know, you want to make it as game-like as possible, so you've got to really meet this pass. And by doing that, I mean, you know, I call it be a ready shooter. Let's drop those knees, hips, and then step in and meet this pass with a one-two step, or in some cases, people may go run up and catch it and do what's called a jump stop or a two-foot takeoff. But he's just standing straight up, waiting for the ball to come to him. In a game situation, a defender's going to step in and steal this pass if you don't meet this pass. So let's practice it in this setting. Again, just to kind of like a little pause here. We'd really love him to step with that left foot to catch the ball, followed by the right, and use that foot placement to really lift your body up. Again, beautiful extension of the shooting arm, breaking of the wrist, fingers point down, the guide hand is on the side, really, really good here. I love the trajectory of the ball going to the rim. He's extended his hips, really, really nice. Nice look here, good extension, the attempt to hold that follow-through. I'd love to see him spread his fingers out a little bit, but overall really good. Again, he may turn a little sideways here. It's hard to see it from this angle. You know, again, that's just, you know, we want to square or face our body to the rim. Really good touch here, really see that guide hand come off the ball right before you shoot it. Nice job. Here's the extension. Again, really, really good here. You know, I'd get those elbows in just a tad, but overall really, really good. He's leaving the floor a little bit. I feel like he could get more power and elevate and lift more with a little more readiness. Again, great lift of the ball. You can see the ball sitting back on the fingers here. Really nice. Let's get that guide elbow in somewhat. Here the shooter is shooting a 15-footer. Pretty good touch and form here, as you can see in the EGO view. That beautiful extension of the right shooting arm. Just beautiful here. Breaking of the wrist, snapping down of the fingers. That guide hand is on the side. I might move that elbow in a little bit so that forearm is parallel to the floor. But overall, really, really good here. Great, good extension here. He's got his feet apart. Eyes and head are up. Again, here's his position as he waits for this pass. That's why I've given him a score of an eight. I really, ideally would love for him to prepare. And I've mentioned all that before. See his hands down. Let's be ready. That's part of being a great shooter is your readiness, your preparation to catch the ball. Here's the lift, again, really nice. But overall he's got, you know, he dips the knees, he's getting ready to jump a little bit, let's get those shooting elbows in under the ball, but this looks really good here with his hand back behind the ball. Here's the landing, balls in the air, beautiful trajectory here for it to go up and in, you know, but what you don't see is his follow-through. He, you know, he drops his follow-through, his arm, right arm down, kind of turns a little sideways or inward. We want to keep our hips and shoulders square and let's extend that right arm in our follow-through. And ideally, you know, a lot of times we hold the follow-through till it hits backboard rim or swishes. Again, he's still waiting for the ball. He does extend his hands out to catch it, which is really good. It looks like he's getting ready to backstop it with his right hand, which is really, really good. That guide hand is where it needs to be to help guide it into this right hand for the shot. But again, let's get our feet apart. Let's drop our knees and our hips and really, really explode into this pass in one motion, catch and shoot. Again, as he prepares to lift, right foot slightly in front. That's what you want to see with a right-hand shooter. He's got the ball sitting on the back of his pads of his fingers, which are not your fingertips and it's not the palm of your hand. I would get that shooting elbow in just a little bit under the ball. You want this elbow to be under the hand. It's out here a little bit. That's being really picky. Again, let's get that guide arm elbow parallel to the floor. I really feel like this guy can jump a lot higher by preparing a little bit and being ready, what I call a ready shooter, to catch and shoot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This because once the climber gets to place the feet and the body is off the mat, then the climb starts. Because the crimp was the most uncomfortable hole to hold onto, the climber has moved the right hand first to make an extension across to the left side. Here the climber is starting a two hand hold start. The left hand is being placed to the right hold with the fingers wrapping around that edge of the block and the climber in order to apply pressure will need to send the elbow to the opposite direction and for the right hand seems to be applied onto the small chip. This has a very small edge so the climber will need to apply force by pressing the fingertips in between the wall and the hold in order to create pressure again would be pointing the elbow towards his core or close to him the hand. We can see the climber has not made the reach and instead is retracting now away from it due to not having enough power to go up to that hold. That seems like a pocket is promising hold and had to let go of the right hand to go up for it due to be holding on to an uncomfortable crimp. Now the left hand being positioned with the fingers on one side the climber still needs to apply pressure going on the opposite direction. So this is counterintuitive of what the climber chose for going up on this way of reading the sequence. So if the climber was going to do this again it would be ideal if the left hand was going for that reach rather than the if the left hand goes up for the reach instead of the right hand. Here we can see how the climber has placed the right hand over to the left side and is holding in as a crimp now Because the climber is placing the fingertips between the wall and the hold being a very small edge you can see that this is hold as a crimp because the Knuckles are sticking out and this is so that the climbers able to transfer the weight or pressure From the fingertips by pulling away on that hold and to give it extra strength the climber also places the thumb Thinking of like holding in it like a nub to create more force onto that crimp", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So you see a lot of different steps, so a nice diversity of the steps that the dancer is executing and also playing with the music a bit. So there are steps like the twisting in the hips, the shifting, and maybe going to the box step that are appropriate along with the music that they hear. So they're doing a lot of stepping out, the dancer is shifting and the way and really allowing themselves to move quite freely in the space because they are moving with a grounded sense of self, they are moving with bent knee, they are isolating and moving with I would say ease and clarity and execution so you know what the dancer is doing from one step to the next. The dancer is reaching up into the air and bringing their arms around when they are doing this step, stepping from side to side, so they have a very nice, clear execution of their arms in terms of being aware of where the arms are going, the direction that they're taking their arms in and dancing that full out. It seems that the dancer is very clear about the movement they're doing and where their body is being placed and where it is going. The dancer's doing really nice footwork and knee work and changing levels here, which was quite dynamic and playing with the music. So the dancer was bending the knee and almost kicking the leg out to shift to the other side and using the arms to help pull and thrust the body up from the floor. And using, I would say, the dancer's core strength to keep control of the body when they were doing these level changes. The dancer also had a very nice use of the floor space, moving from left to right across the floor and taking up space and not staying in one place, which was also nice to see. The dancer does a great job of executing the Charleston. The dancer is even engaging in some level changes and really flaps the arms and the feet. It really is engaged and has a great rhythm with this step and also is staying in tempo with the step, not twisting or shifting in the hips at all, but being stationary in the waist and really just putting the movement into the knees and the feet and the arms that are swaying back and forth and then moving a little bit forward, rocking back and forth as the dance step progresses. Dancer is doing a nice job of also anticipating the music and where the breaks in the music are so that they can play around with different steps. And so that is a nice dynamic the dancer is adding there. And so that is a nice dynamic the dancer is adding there. Dancer is doing a great job as well when the music does change. The singer changes, the tempo changes, the instruments are changing, the dance changes from one song to the next. The dancer very quickly adapts to that new tempo and keeps time with the music and even starts to execute movement that has a different energy and flow but also will bring up the tempo, increase the tempo if the song is also increasing. So it's not just the speed of the step but it's then where the dancer executes a step that has a little bit of a different energy that matches the music that just got changed. Dancers are doing a great job shifting from the box step into doing some swings. And while this might be improvised, the dancer is still making sure that they are executing the movement on both sides of the body, on the right side and the left side, to really complete the phrasing as well as keeping the beat and not really losing that tempo, that beat, that rhythm when they go to shift in the steps or the phrasing or the different combination of steps.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

One of the reasons why I can think that might be an idea for the climber is because the right side of the undercling hold might feel a little bit better. So this would probably encourage the climber to try and hang onto it in the first place. But by getting herself in this cross position, the next move afterwards is what's making it really hard for her to be able to complete any further movement from here. Because what ends up having to happen is as the climber reaches for that hold and wants to move from it, they need to make sure they transition all their bodyweight over onto that left foot. And in the way it is right now, a lot of her bodyweight is kind of placed more over to the right. So it is a large distance and a great area that she has to transition her bodyweight around in order to actually use that right hand hold. So with that, the climber does realize very quickly that this is a very difficult move to complete and does move back to that matching of the start hold. So it's nice to see that the climber is trying to figure out some different movement here. But I would definitely encourage the climber to spend her time off of the wall to try and figure out her movements. So then that way she can commit to a single move because we can see that the climber has been hanging on this wall for a long time, which does use up a lot of energy very quickly. And so here we can see now she's attempting to try and reach over with the left hand and trying to pull in an outwards fashion. So by pulling in this outwards fashion, this is what we call a gaston when you're pulling in an outside direction. So this does make it a very powerful move by utilizing a gaston. But one thing that I'm seeing with this climber is with the direction of her left knee kind of going in an internal rotation, that actually helps to push her body weight over to the right. So she's kind of counteracting her movements right here because her arm wants to pull outwards, but her leg is pushing her over to the right. So she's kind of working against herself right here, but shortly afterwards, her left foot does slide off. So again, I would just recommend to this climber to step off the wall, really figure out exactly what type of move she wants to commit to. And then when she has something in mind, then at that point to get on the wall and try and commit to that move. So then that way she can kind of conserve her energy because by going back and forth while on the wall, this does use up a lot of energy very quickly and could make it very difficult to complete the boulder overall.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I would encourage the dancer when they do that hit hit hit to make sure they drop their pelvis all the way to almost all the way to the ground when their arms are shooting out here to create different levels and greater dynamic qualities to this advanced choreography. I would again encourage this dancer to release their shoulders so they don't look a little more less awkward and they feel like their chest is communicating with the audience. Overall, the dancer has really great energy and really great attack of the movement. I would encourage them to one ground, be more precise, as well as incorporate their center, meaning incorporate their hip articulation and their ribcage articulation. The dancer sometimes slips and slides in their sneakers and lose balance. So a way to avoid that is one, to engage the core. Second, to really drive that foot into the ground and be sure about where to place the weight. So the choreography always looks clean and precise. I would encourage the dancer to make sure that they drop that pelvis because they do a really good job of being engaged in their torso.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

We see that his wrists or fists are a bit higher than his arms. The shape that in which he's making his hands shouldn't be in front of his eyes as they are. His fists and his fingers should be aligned with his elbows. Right now they're at an angle. They really should be at a straight horizontal line. The dancer is also looking downward. We see that he sees his feet in the camera as well as mostly of most of the frame for him is the floor It's also Compacting his spine and making him seems shorter and his spine is then on an angle tilted forward Instead of being in a straight line pulling up So again He needs to pull up from his spine towards the ceiling and he also can further aid this by keeping his eyes on Level straight ahead of him and not tilting his head downward The dancer looks a bit off balance when he raises his arm over his head and crosses his feet at the same time He can be He can maintain a better sense of balance if he stands up higher in his verticality So he needs to pull up from the base of his spine or his coccyx bone All the way up so that he makes room for his foot to be crossing as it is underneath over The other foot but it's more it's easier for him to lose balance Especially since he's using both arms and legs here if he doesn't create that space that he needs He can create that space again by pulling upward The dancer ends the dance in a position. We see that his spine is upright. Again, he's looking a little bit downward. Not as much as before though, and it's good that he is ending the dance in a straight linear position to announce that he's finished. So in that way it's organized. When the dancer turns, he's merely turning around, but again, since he seems a bit short in his spine and not pulling all the way upward, what can help him as an image to turn is turning on an axis so that when he's turning, he actually feels like he's spiraling upward instead of just turning straight forward. So that spiral would be happening in his spine so that he's both turning and pulling upward at the same time instead of merely just turning forward because that is why he is a bit crunched in his spine. The dancer has great energy on this tapping step. He's tapping his knees forward, he's pushing his shoulders forward, he's pumping his chest. So he has great energy when he executes this step in particular. The dancer is staying stagnant in one space, or one place in the space. After he does two steps, he's supposed to be sliding outward in each direction. He has a great deal of space to use in the studio, but he's not using it. He is staying in one position. Instead, he should be sliding out to the side and traveling. The dancer continues to look down periodically. It's continuing to condense his spine. He needs to look straight forward. The dancer is a bit heavy on his feet, but he's making an attempt to try to be on his toes, which is good What can make him even lighter on his feet as if he puts more of his weight onto his toes and lifts his heels more So that his steps aren't so heavy And in assisting also putting his weight onto his toes. He can pull up high pulling up high will also Create that room for him so that he is not so heavy on his feet The dancer is not using his hips here. With each step he takes, he should be moving his hips, but his hips are pretty much so staying underneath himself. They're staying just stagnant in the same place as he is, but his hips should be moving horizontally on diagonals, and that is not something that he's doing here, so he should be engaging his hips more for a greater range of motion.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

However, again, the same issues tend to happen here. Her upper body is really disconnected, and she's not performing any specific choreography with her arms. She has a lot of stiffness through her shoulders, her spine, and her pelvis, which overall makes her appear awkward and more disconnected from the rhythm throughout the rest of her body as compared to her feet. As the dancer performs a series of slight jumps where she's crossing one leg here in this instance It's her right leg crossing over her left leg. She appears very pedestrian in her movements She really lacks any sort of connection to the rhythm And really doesn't perform any sort of specific arm choreography. You can see her arms are in a very pedestrian manner Situated in a very pedestrian manner here Overall, she doesn't appear to be performing any sort of specific Embodied rhythm here, and she also appears very frantic and pedestrian perhaps additional practice of the choreography would be beneficial As the dancer performs a series of step touches, touching this one foot out in front of her and then bringing it back to meet in the middle and alternating feet, she's able to maintain a connection to the rhythm, particularly through her feet. However, the rest of her body from her knees up is really disengaged. She's not performing any specific choreography and is not really engaging with the rhythm in any significant way. Here the dancer starts to incorporate some audible movements which includes some snapping of her fingers and a clap. However, the snapping of her fingers and the clapping really demonstrate how disconnected she is from the rhythm. She also has a slight bounce happening in her knees which is really disconnected from the rhythm as well and not a lot of engagement happening through her shoulders, her spine, and her pelvis which is making her appear quite stiff as she's performing the movement. As the dancer performs a swaying motion back and forth, alternating between crossing her legs over herself and changing her facing slightly, she stays slightly connected to the rhythm, however she really starts to lose the connection when she performs this swaying step. If she were to bend her knees more and drop her pelvis back, as well as engage her upper body in a meaningful way, she would be able to stay more connected to the rhythm here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He has become accustomed to those and so it it's semi-efficient for him But to really bring his playing up to the next level. We would want to really kind of go back to those basics and Working hands independently and really strengthening those muscles to function the way that With Those curved up fingers to make it a little bit more fluid in his playing and to help him go into the next level All right, the pianist is starting out. He has a pretty good posture and arm position and hand position in relation to the piano. We are seeing, starting with arpeggios, you can see how the pianist is jumping here instead of kind of turning and tucking to go to the next or crossing over to go to the next octave. He's just lifting his hand in general and so working on some of those turns would be helpful. So, again, it's just memory with the key, and so I would recommend probably going by around the circle of fifths, so that you go from the key of C to the key of G, adding one sharp to the key of D, adding another sharp, so then you get to two sharps, to the key of A, three sharps, to the key of E, four sharps. Because when you play that way, it's a lot easier to remember where you're at, and those arpeggio patterns, and rather than, you know, when you move up chromatically, it is a little bit more difficult to remember on the fly, you know, when you're going through quickly, where your sharps and flats are. So while shifting rather than turning, that even though it's just slight, it does create a bit of hesitation before playing the next section. And so that is the benefit of using that. You know, you want to stretch and turn and we want to practice that. So by playing, you know, like finger one, one, two, three, and then tucking the thumb as you're rolling up allows you to kind of get those there and practice that. So you would practice a one, two, three, one, and then you do that again. One, two, three, one, one, two, three, one. And then one once that feels comfortable, then you would want to add the one, two, three, one, two into the next phrase and making that. And so as you finish the second arpeggio, the second octave, one, two, three, one, two, three, five, three, two, one, cross, three, two, one. And that would kind of help with that overall flow of those arpeggios. So rather than a progressive exercise it is Kind of a lift and separate or separate and lift in that area and so Yeah, I would just kind of encourage him to work on each hand in independently so that You can kind of work out where that where those Turns are gonna be His fingers are rather straight and so we want to kind of work on that hand position Nice and curved into the C cup position Which allows your fingers to be at the same Length hitting each of the keys", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This means that the climber will have to come from a low set of holes which were where his hands and feet were down below to then do an explosive dynamic move where he will be lifted in the air then trying to land the hand up onto the next hole that is a distance. So in order for the climber to do this when he was swinging below was to generate movement which the movement then he will take advantage of that momentum when he sprints out to the right side by pushing forcefully lastly on the right foot that's the one that displays the closest and at a highest stance. As we know each limb will come out at different times but eventually they all would be out of their place. The right hand coming out first since the climber will have to make the reach up to the right the grips engages the climber to keep his chest forward against the wall which he will have to pull forcefully before engaging the last foot on the push. Here the climber is starting at a two hand hold start. Both of the start holds are donuts. As we can see the climber is placing his hand at the bottom of that donut and creating a pinch effect in order to sustain the grip. As the other grip also being on the left hand, he will place pressure by leaning on the hold. And the climber is on the mat right now so once the feet are placed on the wall as the right foot is already placed on the foot hold and the climber is no longer touching the mat then the climb will start. It's important of the climber that when on the leap, when each limb is leaving the holes, the last one being the right foot, that he reaches a certain height, which will be out of his control. But he needs to know when his center of gravity is above the right foot, that is the one last in place. Doing so, the climber had pushed the foot down to engage on the forceful spring, but has done this early. Now the climber is, gravity is driving away from the wall due to now not going with the force of the direction where the climber needed to go. Since the climber is now getting driven away from the wall, it will be almost impossible for the climber to palm the hole above. As we can see, the climber is swinging to create momentum when going for a dynamic move, which potentially would be at the right. One because the right hand is positioned lower, and the second because the right foot is the one that is placed at a higher stance and the climber is glancing over to the right side.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Because she was already low, when she did the previous movement where she was pumping and twisting her right knee in and then pumping her left arm, because she was already so close to the floor, she's able to easily bend this left knee down to slide in, which she did a nice little clean slide into the next part. So I've learned that when you are ready to go down to the floor, for people who it may be hard to go from a high level or a medium level to the floor, the lower you are right before you get down, the easier it is going to be to transition. And she did a really nice, smooth transition from a squatting position into the floor on one knee. All right, and that last little eight count, really good, again, sticking to the music, hearing the melody, hearing the beats, and hitting the accents with her movements. A really strong finish, those arms are nice and high and lifted. This leg is straight, the toe is pointed. She's pushing into her right hip to the side, and the head is leveled and looking straight forward. So, a really nice finish for this piece. All right, the part right before this, it's the dun-dun-dun-dun. Really nice with the music, musicality of that part. I would have shook a little harder, but really good sticking directly with the music and making it really clear for the next part. So here she just, her energy kind of gets a little bit more elevated. She punches forward, taking two steps to punch forward and then punching out to the side. Again, her energy definitely lifts up at this point, which is really nice. So the next part she just did a spin around a really nice clean turn but I could tell she lost her almost lost her balance a little bit on the turn so just making sure once you spin around making sure you spot to help you just get around in a very clean way but then also just getting your feet back on the floor nice and flat so you're able to just land properly. Here she does a layout which is actually really nice. It was very controlled. I could tell she's balancing. Everything looks even. Her leg is up at a nice level off the floor. This foot is flat. This knee is slightly bent a little bit. Her eyes are looking straight up to the ceiling. So really nice. Her arms are just out really nice. Just a real nice simple layout and I could tell she definitely is using her core to keep her balanced as well. So here's now she punched up twice to the ceiling. Those arms are in a nice fist. And then that toe really lovely, nice and pointed. As she brings it up to passe, not quite a passe because it's not at the knee, but the foot is nice because it is pointed. And then again, her energy is just really starting to rise up at this moment and really nice. So this next part, she does a release, dropping her head. And as you see, her knees are bent. Both feet are flat on the floor. Her head is down. Her back is almost flat. So definitely, it was a really quick drop. So I probably would have just let it go just maybe two seconds longer, just to get the full effect of the drop and release. All right, the footwork just now was really, really nice and clean. That would be really easy to teach because you could just see every single step, and she took her time throughout her steps and her movements and did all the feet, the footwork full out. All right, so in the beginning, the dancer starts stepping out and pointing her finger forward and then reaching over. In this moment, reaching over with her right arm, reaching around and back. This is a really nice moment. It definitely matches the music. I would prefer to see her energy just increase just a little bit as she's starting off the dance. Alright, so this next part is a little bit confusing. She did a kickball change, kickball change, and a little bit of twisting, and then when she started to turn around, the footwork got a little confusing, so I would just clean that up a little bit. I'm not quite sure what she was trying to do, but just try to clean it up because you're also spinning around and changing directions. You want to be clear about your feet and what they're doing. So as she went down, again, a nice smooth transition getting up. She was just facing, her body was facing the ceiling. Her eyes were facing the ceiling. She had one hand on the floor, her left hand, I believe, on the floor. And she was able to easily twist her body around and then go into a lunge. And because she was already so low to the floor, and I'm sure due to flexibility, she was able to easily transition that leg forward into a lunge to then get up for the next step. So here she used a really good use her arms full out the arms are up and open and extended she's lifting up in her body and then she almost comes off the floor I'm not sure if she was meant to go up on her toes or not I would have just committed to just rising fully up on your toes and trying to hold that pose or hold it flat but then still holding your chest up nice and high but really good nice arms for that part All right, this next sequence where she's punching her fist down and then out and then she does a little like kind of star hands open jazz hands across in front of her face. Really good job using the music and hitting the accents of the music on this part. I just want to highlight the spin that she just did. It was a very clean spin. She stepped and just did a nice little bend of her knees and then spun around about a full turn and maybe about a quarter and then landed really nicely to the corner here. Her feet are together. As you see her hair is still whipping around but it was just a really clean turn.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

What this is doing is creating a very tough omelette. It's essentially overcooking the eggs and if you overcook, for example, scrambled eggs, they're going to become very rubbery and dried out. Just a note on sanitation here. The individual took the eggshell from the egg that they just broke into the bowl and set it on the cutting board where there was a raw onion. Now, there is then the chance for cross-contamination. If that onion was going to be used raw, there's potentially salmonella that you get from that egg. So if some of the egg residual contacted the onion, there is a potential for cross-contamination and potentially salmonella. Here an onion is being cut. Now the ends of the onion were cut off and then the individual is starting to cut the onion with the skin still on. Once the ends of the onion have been cut off, it's advisable to remove the outside skin of the onion prior to chopping it. This way you avoid having any onion skin in with your vegetable. You can see browning occurring on the outside of the egg. With a classic omelet, the goal is to have no browning of the egg at all. Here you see the omelet being flipped over. When making a classic omelet, the process would be to add your eggs to a 6-8 inch or 15-20 centimeter saute pan or omelet pan. Using a rubber spatula, you would gently stir the eggs until your curds start to form. Once your curds start to form, you want to make sure that your heat is low and you allow your eggs to finish cooking so you won't see any wet egg on the top of that omelet. Once the egg is finished cooking, you can either add your filling and fold the omelet in half or roll your omelet in thirds and then cut a slit in the top. You can hear a little bit of sizzling when the egg mixture is added to the pan. This indicates that the pan is too hot. So the way to avoid this is just to warm your fat over a low heat because the eggs should be cooked on a relatively low heat. The pan that has been selected is too large for a one-egg omelet. And generally, omelets are made with two to three eggs, not just a single egg. So here, the pan should be approximately six to eight inches or 15 to 25 centimeters. This almost looks like a crepe pan that has been selected. Here you have the egg and raw vegetables in the same bowl, and the individual is using a spoon to mix the egg and the vegetable. Now, two things here. One, the vegetable should be saut\u00e9ed separately and then added to the omelette at the end. Whether it's a folded over omelette, it would be added on top of the egg and then folded over. If it's a French omelette, a classic omelette, then you're going to use three folds. Fold the omelette in thirds or roll it in thirds, and then make a slit in the top and add your vegetables. Secondly, a fork is generally a better tool to use, or a whisk, like a balloon whisk, would be a better choice than a spoon. It will give you better mixing. Here you see that the chopping of the onion is a bit haphazard. So the size of the pieces of onion are not uniform. What is recommended is anytime vegetables are being added to a dish, is that they are cut in a uniform size. What this does is allows them to cook at the same time. So they'll be finished cooking all around the same time. Here oil is being added to the pan prior to adding the egg. While oil is completely acceptable for making an omelette, the classic way for making an omelette would be to use clarified butter as your fat.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

So she's going over there left hand. She's kind of leaving it alone, not really supporting with her right, which is tough, but her form with that actual left hand is pretty good. And I like where her gaze is up right up at the rim. I'll give her a five. She did great. She settled in and found the right power and was pretty consistent with it and made probably over half of her shots. She just needs to use more lift, be quicker between the right and left side transitions, and also have her offhand supporting the ball too. So if she used too much power, look for her to adjust that in the next couple reps. Same thing on the right side, the strong hand is just being left alone with no support from the weak hand.

She increased her octave each time, so she added another octave every time she played through the scale. She had a nice even, her hand position was good. She is playing with an even pulse and all is going well. In the pianist ends her exercise with an arpeggio going from low to high and has done a really nice job keeping the tempo even and steady.

This is a good extension with the right arm, but he's releasing it from far too low and it's going to lose him a lot of points. He also brings the ball a little too low, almost to his waist.

So that's because his finger just didn't get to the right spot and didn't go down far enough down the fingerboard. The chord shape that he's using for this chord here is accurate. He has all of his fingers in the correct spot. So his first finger on the first fret, second finger on the second fret, third finger on that fret. So he has to stretch out his hand a little bit, but he's getting to the right notes on the right strings, and the chord sounds accurate. The guitarist is demonstrating that the first finger goes from this third fret here to the second fret while these other fingers are being held down. This demonstrates a good amount of finger independence. So his first finger is able to move while the other fingers stay down and that is a skill that many guitarists work very hard at and he's doing it pretty easily and demonstrating it with a lot of ease of use. The guitarist is playing a seventh chord with a stretch of about four frets. So there's one finger there, one finger there, one finger there, and then one finger there. So this is a hand shape that's pretty common in guitar, but he's playing it with a lot of clarity and the fingers are all in the right spots to get the correct chord and notes to sound. He played an incorrect note going up the scale right here with his first finger on that fret, but then he kept going. In order to play some of these arpeggios, the guitarist is kind of stretching out his hand pretty far. So you can see his first finger here and the fourth finger there are pretty far apart. And he's doing that to accommodate those large leaps when playing arpeggios. And he's doing it and it sounds pretty smooth. For this handshape, his first finger here has to reach back to the first fret, while these three fingers over here are a little bit farther down, so there's a little bit of a reach and a bit of a stretch for this chord, but he was able to find the right note at the right time, and it sounds pretty clear. As he played this low note over here, he kind of wiggled his finger a little bit using a bit of vibrato which helps warm up the sound. He played this scale with a lot of clarity and ease. He kept his fingers really close to the fingerboard of the guitar. They didn't leave the string very far. They stayed really close. So he was able to play those notes in rapid succession with a lot of evenness and clarity. The last few times that he shifted his left hand back and forth a little bit, it was very smooth and fluid looking, and so all the notes really sounded smooth and connected, and he was able to go up and down the fingerboard with ease. He played a few notes in this position right here and then his finger very smoothly went to the next spot and he got his fingers in the right spot for the next chord pretty smoothly and pretty evenly. So that showed a lot of good skill of changing hand positions and then finding that next chord. His left hand moved from one position here to the next and then to the next. And so that worked really well. It was very slick and he got to the spots accurately and with not a lot of attention in his left hand. He's using a finger pick here and going in a down, up, down, up, down, up pattern, and he's doing that with a lot of clarity with that finger pick in his right hand right there.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Her shoulders are pointed towards the baseline right now, giving her a less likely chance for the ball to have a crucial spin towards the backboard to complete a successful finish. On this attempt for a right-handed reverse layup, we noticed that the player's hand on the left side of frame is tilting a little bit towards the right, as we wanted her to do for her adjustment. However, she is still pushing the ball towards the back of the rim, not giving it a chance to be higher above the rim to be able to have that drop going through the net. Pushing the ball on the outer side of the rim will just allow it to come right back towards you. If the offensive player hand tilted a little bit more towards the right and gave the ball a higher chance, it will have a better opportunity of hitting our target area and going through the net for a successful finish. Again, as we can notice from this offensive player on the left side of the frame, her hand is pushing the ball forward. We want to tilt her hand going towards the right side, giving the ball a little bit more spin so it can be able to hit our target area and have a better opportunity of going through the net.

We will want the player to jump with her right foot first and jump off her left foot to make her finish. Even though the ball placement for this offensive player is correct, for this particular layup it is not. For a reverse layup, her body needs to be shifted towards the sideline to give her more of an opportunity to spin the ball softly onto the backboard. Her body placement facing the baseline will make it more difficult to shield a defender from contesting or blocking her shot for her layup. Another minor adjustment we can make for this player to improve her finishing ability on her reverse layups. As we can notice on the left frame, we see that her hand is pushing the ball forward. We will want to rotate her hand towards the right to give the ball a slight spin to be able to hit our located target, which is on the right corner of the box on the backboard.

This is crucial that the climber keeps the foot in place and is able to apply the right pressure when making the stance as he will need to gain height. At this point the climber will be coming off the wall due to only securing one point of contact on the wall. The first move out of the start the climber has placed pressure on the foot down below this so that the climber is able to gain height and Doing this the climber also needed to pull himself close to the wall blocking the move in order to reach up to the pinch hold. As we can see the climber has placed the hand as High as he can to create friction and pull on the hold to maintain pressure as he pinches on the hold with the hands With the fingers on the right side and the thumb press on the other side to generate power on the grid As we can see, the climber is making some hand gestures. This will help the climber to visualize the sequence when on the wall before attempting to climb. Now that the climber has secured the right hand on the pinch, the climber needs to now release the left hand to make the next move to the following hold. As we can see, the right foot has come out of placement and this is because the climber is keeping the leg extended to transfer over the weight to the left foot being placed the highest. The right leg being extended, this is called flagging in as the climber is pointing the toe inwards to support the climber staying on his right side when making the pull. This will keep his hips close to the wall when performing the stance and shift the weight over to the highest foot when gaining height. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start, meaning that each hand is holding to its grips and down below the climber has placed the feet, the right foot being in position first.

Right here, his posture is straight up, putting himself in a position to grab a rebound or get back on defense for the most part. I think his posture is pretty good. The follow through is there as well. He's targeting in the right spot, the white box on the backboard.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

However, the dancer would still benefit from some additional refinement in the footwork and the arms as well as connecting this movement a bit more deeply to the movement vocabulary that they are performing. As the dancer moves through a series of turns, he's able to find some clarity, particularly in his footwork as he accents the turn at the end of the turn. However, the transitional steps in between are still really lacking clarity and connection to the movement vocabulary as well as the rhythm of the music. He would also benefit from finding a deeper way to incorporate his free arm into the choreography itself. As the dancer and his partner begin to move through some basic steps while connected physically, both with hands wrapped around one another and also holding hands out in front of them, they're able to find a nice synchronicity with their footwork and find a lot of clarity here as partners. However, they're struggling to really develop and connect to the rhythm. They're able to perform the mechanics of the footwork, but it's really lacking the movement dynamics and attention to rhythm that's needed for this choreography. However, they are both able to work together and they're able to stay physically connected even while moving or locomoting through the space quite significantly. As the dancers continue to transition through a variety of steps and a variety of points where they're physically connected versus doing solo moments, they really struggle to find consistency in their movement, both as partners and as a single dancer. Particularly in the footwork and in the incorporation of the arms, the dancer, both of them, but particularly this dancer, is often really looking down to the floor, which is keeping them from really looking out into the space and performing the choreography more fully. It's also keeping them from being visually connected with their partner, which might help them to work through these transitions, as well as find more consistency in their partnership in the choreography. As the dancers begin to move through some movement where they're only physically connected via holding hands, they start to really struggle, particularly with the footwork and finding clarity in their movement as connected to the rhythm of the music and also the movement vocabulary.

That's a good habit to have. That's good elevation. You get at least two to three inches off the ground on that jump shot.

So although when he was in a position of bending his knees, his elbow was pointing away from the ball, away from the rim, as he jumps in the air and slightly turns his hip. Now, just before he releases the ball, his elbow is aligned with the front of the rim. As you can see, he still has contact with the ball. So now at this position, everything is aligned with the front of the rim. Now, as he releases the ball, at this point, it's perfectly on target to be able to go into the air with that nice rainbow arc and into the basket. So although his elbow is pointing away from the rim as he begins his shooting motion, just before he releases the ball, due to him jumping in the air, while he's in the air, he's able to align himself properly with the rim and release a good shot towards the basket. On the release of the shot you can see the shooter does a nice job of snapping his wrist on the release of the ball. This creates good backspin on the ball as the ball leaves the shooter's right hand. We take a look at the positioning of the shooter's feet. You can see that his feet are even with each other shoulder width apart. And if we also take a look at his right elbow, you can see that his elbow is slightly away from, pointing away from his body. It's slightly outside of his body. Ideally we would like for this elbow to be in closer to his body so that it's aligned with the front of the rim. In order to do that, to have the elbow aligned with the front of the rim comfortably, we would like for the shooter's right foot to be slightly in front of his left foot. So when we're able to turn our bodies that with the right foot in front of the left foot, that will make it so that it's natural and comfortable for the shooter's right elbow to be aligned with the front of the rim. Take a look at the positioning of the shooter's elbow on the release of the ball. We can see that his elbow is slightly above the level of his eyes. By his elbow being above the level of his eyes on the release of the ball, this allows for the power that he generated from his legs to transfer into the ball on the release, giving the ball that nice good rainbow arc as it travels to the rim and inside of the basket. As the shooter is preparing to release the ball, we take a look at the shooter's left hand, which is his guy hand. We can see that he is closing up his hand. So you see here it kind of looks like the form of a C. But as he is releasing the ball, his hand is closing. On the release of the ball, we want to keep this hand completely open. So that as we are releasing the ball, our left guy hand has no impact on the ball. So our fingers are nice and spread with the palm open and facing the direction of our right shooting hand.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Instead of it feeling like, okay, I lost the step, it can feel like, okay, I'm getting ready to do something else. So really thinking about those transitions, take it to the advanced choreography level. I would encourage the dancer to be more grounded through their movement so they can take bigger steps forward and backward, even if they're on the balls of their foot. I think overall they just need to work on drilling the dance. So not only just drilling but being more grounded. So practicing that groundedness while drilling the dance over and over and over will help with that precision and overall cleanliness. This whole section I would encourage the dancer to ground their pelvis more so they can move really full, embodied from their heart center all the way out to their extremities and back in very quickly. I would encourage the dancers to engage and incorporate their ribcage throughout so it feels more effortless like they're moving from heart center instead of their arms moving in this kind of bicycle pattern.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He should be stepping on his toe first. When the dancers are opening up here, he can be pulling further back from her so that their arms are straight at shoulder length level instead of low here. He bends his knees while here so that he is able to get more mobility and so that his center of gravity is closer to the floor. The dancer does a good job of clapping here in a nice loud way. It's very audible his clap I'm meaning he's probably clapping with a clearly open hands and it's great that he's able to make a loud concrete sound here They also can be pulling apart further in space. So if he was to move back and she would to be moved back a little bit more, the space in between them would be greater than. This is another circumstance in which the dancer can bring his arm outward at shoulder length, or at least so it's outward at his partner's shoulder length, so they can get more counterbalancing of each other's weight. Because the dancer is taller than his partner, when he looks out straight ahead, it's above her face. But he should be looking at his partner's face, especially her eyes, so that they can remain in contact with each other and connection. So that it would be easier to follow along and be with each other while they're dancing. The answer is dancing flat footed sometimes with this entire foot on the ground. Instead, his heel or back of his foot should be lifted off the ground so he can be more mobile. The dancer is not completely articulate with his footwork. Whenever his feet are supposed to be together, those triple steps are the steps of one, two, three. But on the second step, his feet should be touching. And he's just not being very articulate with each one of the steps that he's taking. The dancer is taking very small steps here.

Each hand is delicately and accurately executing its part, and you can see how the left hand slightly reaches over the... so that the hands... so you can see right here the left hand is slightly further up on the keys than the right hand, and that's allowing those notes to be shared so that there's no conflict with the fingers. So this time through this phrase it is slightly louder and dynamic and she is executing that well. So through that phrase, we're hearing a different tonality, and then we end with that major chord, and we come back to the main phrase from the beginning of this piece of music. So through this section you can see with the louder forte and the music she's using a bit more strength in her arms and You can see even a little bit more power in her fingers as she is playing through that phrase The pianist starts out very well. She has good posture, good hand technique. She breathes in time with the music. She had a really nice setup as she was beginning. And as she articulates that low pitch, it has a great tenuto on it. It's not overly loud, it's just articulating the punctuation of that section in the music. So again, we have a nice extension down here for that low pitch as it ends, and then there's a nice lift off as we start into the next section. So you can see right here as she lifts her wrist up, this is really a well executed phrase release where we are working to get that lift of the piano so that you have the touch and the connection with the piano as long as possible.

So even though it's moving slow, when you're moving slow you have to be even that much more precise because you can't get away with missing those little details, especially in basic choreography. I would encourage the dancers to think about their arm placement. Notice how this arm kind of goes dead a little bit. So making sure that you have attention in both arms is super important to this detail of partner choreography, right? Because it's about the frame or the carriage to hold each other up versus when your hands are disconnected and you're pushing and pulling versus even when your arms are separated, that communicates something. So having power and strength when you're separated is also important. I would encourage the dancers to really think about the swing and sway and the curvature of the movement, right? And how you can continue to flow without ever having awkward pauses. So thinking really through how you move through transitions. Immediately, I would encourage the dancers to not look at the floor, but to look at each other, and to look up and out so they don't bump into each other or anything else. I would encourage dancers to keep making sure that they have a strong connection here with the pushing and pulling, telling their partner where to go, or taking instruction from their partner by giving a little pressure or getting a little pressure. I would encourage these dancers to really study and listen to the music because they are off of the beat. I would encourage the dancers to really engage those hips so it doesn't, especially this box step, doesn't feel awkward.

Right here, this angle is really, really low. It's really tough. Maybe it's because of the wall, but right now, he's not really getting a lot from this drill because of the angle and because of the short distance he's going. I feel like for the sake of the video, you're going to take one dribble, two steps, and also not really focus on the target. Ideally, you want to start up a little bit higher. Give yourself a chance to go game speed, all right? Dribbling with your right hand, left hand, it really doesn't matter. But making sure you're taking the shortest distance possible to get your butt to that rim as fast as possible. He's standing straight up, no leverage at all to be able to be strong and explode out with the layup. I feel like right here he's leaving too much room for error, right? Not being able to protect the ball. The ball is free right here. It's easy, blockable, all right? So you want to make sure your body is in position to protect the ball, all right?

This arm coming up also looks really strong, nice straight elbow and energy out the fingertips. Too slow of a dynamic here. She's bringing this elbow up while this knee is coming in and she's just not attacking it enough.

This arm also looks very clear and strong and I like that she's also dancing on the balls of her feet. That's helping to keep her movement smaller, smoother, more efficient. Very weak here. Well, she did a good job standing up very quickly from this lunge to an upright position, so I will give her that, but the arms are very weak and so the strength of her rising up with the legs is really lost because the arms are too, again, too smooth, not enough attack, not enough sharpness. Good footwork moment again here for her. She's on the balls of her feet She's keeping her feet pretty close to each other which helps to make the movement more efficient more interesting more smooth more elegant She's also got soft knees here, which is also helping with all of those qualities Really stiff here and that's because she's holding her neck really stiffly and gazing straight forward as her arms are coming up and around. So I'd love to see if she could just let that loosen up a little bit more, maybe change her gaze of direction, but just really let it reverberate and relax more and respond more to what she's doing so that this doesn't look so stiff. This is really weak. She's the feet look pretty good But the arms are doing this really kind of strange up-and-down movement with the elbows and the fingers kind of splayed I don't think she really understands the point of this the intention behind this movement so I'd ask her to clarify that with the choreographer and Think about moving maybe more from the shoulders or the core or even moving up and down with the knees rather than the elbows going Up and down it looks really amateurish She's not coming down onto the floor correctly. This is not very good technique for falls. What she needed to do was get her weight on her right foot and her left arm, but rather than that she kind of kept her weight on both feet until the last second when she just put her hand down, but her weight isn't actually really much in that arm. So when we're doing a fall it's really important to establish the hand as a contact point ASAP and to have the shoulder lined up over the elbow over the wrist. You can see here that her shoulders more forward because she doesn't have much weight on it. And also she's doing a pretty good job now of bringing her leg or her weight towards the side of her leg rather than the top, so she is doing that well. Pretty good job here again finding a shape and holding it. I wish she would have held it for just a millisecond longer, but pretty good job. I like that she's got a strong leg here, a nice straight knee and straight out through the toes here, and arms down also look really strong and clear. She's doing this fist motion, one arm and then now bringing the other forward and she's doing it really slowly but not in a controlled way. It lacks energy, it lacks pizzazz, there's no sharpness to it which doesn't match up with the shapes themselves. It's a very straight arm with a fist and making coming into this X position and so neither is she going for a sharp dynamic nor a controlled legato dynamic. What she's doing is more of this like low energy movement and also she's quite stiff through the whole rest of her body. It's just the arms that are moving so it really lacks dynamics, it lacks interest, it lacks coordination. Here's her layout here. Pretty darn good. She did a great job with the arms coming out and up. Nice straight elbows, energy out the fingertips here. Looking up at the ceiling, really great. Her leg looks really strong, nice line out the toes. And it's nice and high, so a 90 degree angle here. A layout, typically we want it sort of to hinge so that the back is actually in line with the foot. So I'd love to see if she could work on her core strength and think of this less as an arch through the back and more as a flat line from the toes to the head. One thing that could help her with that is a plie through her standing leg. And also again, generating some momentum as she came backwards to prepare for this moment. Really weak transition here. She's just sort of standing. She's got straight knees which means that she's not going to have a lot of spring or momentum to really move. She's just standing here in this non-specific way, sort of looking in a non-specific direction, and then she's just slowly bringing her arms up here but it looks really unintentional and weak because there's not a lot of clarity and strength to the shapes and then a lot of tension through her fingers. So here she started her spinal articulation really well with the lumbar spine, but then moves the whole thoracic and cervical spine as one unit, and so loses the nice articulation and again makes it look very stiff. Here she's doing a good job with a plie, a little bit of a twist through the spine. The arms and hands look really strong here. I also like that she's looking up towards her hands in this moment. It helps to make this look a little less stiff. Her dancing in general kind of stiff and so by choosing to gaze upward here it takes away some of that stiffness that we're seeing in other moments. Here she led this movement with her arm with her shoulder coming up and down which looks a little bit tense and a little bit awkward. So I'd say lead more from a twist of the torso which is a much stronger place to move from. This is really nice. She took a really big risk by stepping really far back on this foot, which is really cool because that makes it look exaggerated and even more impressive. Arms again are really nice. She's making a really good arc here. A little bit high in the shoulders, like raising the shoulders a bit too much, but I won't nitpick that too much. Lots of energy out the fingertips, nice straight elbows, and I like that she's really going for it on the balls of her feet here. It makes it look really impressive because she's going so high in the air so quickly. I think she forgot what she was supposed to do here because she just sort of opened her arms and is now letting them reverberate back upward again not dancing through her transitions very well. Good job here. She's brought this hand to the back of her head and I like that she looked away from that hand and slightly gone into that left side of the pelvis there and the attack is really nice, very sharp. It's a very brief moment but she does it very well. She is actually ahead of the music here. She's really rushed this section. She might be nervous about getting in time for the next part of the music. So she really rushed her arms coming back here and was frankly ahead of the beat. And also let go too soon of that shape. Because again, I think she's trying to get to the next thing. She's rushing basically. So because she got there early, I would say that's even more excuse, a more reason to hold the shape for longer. You had time, hold it, let it read as a shape before you move on, but she doesn't. So she's still rushing in this moment as she's letting go of these arms. She's holding this position which is not, it's just frankly a boring position to look at. It just looks like someone's standing there and that is not what this choreography and this music really sounds like or feels like. It doesn't feel pedestrian but she just stands here and holds this for like a whole bar of music and it's not good. I just recommend she have an actual interesting stillness instead of this sort of casual stillness. So because she didn't put her weight on this arm to start with, in order to begin her tabletop she had to move her hand slightly, which means that instead of just one or two fluid movements, she's having to do three to four movements, which makes it look jerky. Pretty good. She's a little bit early for the music here and it's really important to be right in the pocket, especially at the beginning and end of a choreography. The shape itself looks really nice, nice straight knee with the toes on the floor with these mirrored by these really nice arms, great specific shape, angle with the shoulders, nice straight elbow, energy out the fingertips. Again, lack of sharpness in her dynamics coming to this position, which is unfortunate because the position looks really strong. It's just how she got into it. The quality of the movement is really lacking. I'd love to see her sharply attack this movement or come up really slowly and controlled. Again, she's somewhere in between those two and so it doesn't look great. It doesn't look intentional. I wish that as she came up here she did a good job with the dynamics and sort of rolling up through her spine for the most part. Again quite stiff through the thoracic and cervical spine so kind of moving that as one unit, but regardless it was a good dynamic as she came up. I wish she would have kept her hands on the back of her head instead of letting them go as she came up because that nice dynamic with the torso is lost. We can't really enjoy it because the arms are distracting because they look very weak. Good footwork there, nice job being on the balls of her feet. She's moving quickly, efficiently, smoothly. She just brought her leg out to a straight knee but immediately brought it into this position so again lack of clarity and holding her shapes is making the movement look imprecise because it is a little bit imprecise. Again, lack of strength is not helping her. She really straightened these elbows very quickly and then brought them really quickly back up. So we don't get to see a shape. We don't get to see something held. Again, I think she's relying more on her joints than her muscles, which is one reason it doesn't look very strong. Again, lack of dynamics. She does attempt to do a little bit of a quicker sharper movement there, but it looks very very weak I think she may just need to Generally work on the actual strength of the muscles in her arms because even though she's attacking she's sort of resting more on her joint straightening rather than resting on Rather than relying on her muscles moving to make this happen Unfortunately this arm movement really doesn't work for her. She brought it down to her pubic bone and up with this bent elbow but this is as far as it gets. It really looked like it was meant to fully unfold into another straight arm. This coming up here just looks really awkward. So she's begun the choreography here, pretty good shapes. I don't like the bend at the wrist here, that makes her arm shape look a little bit weak. This arm shape looks really strong, nice straight elbow, energy off the fingertip. Also being on the balls of her feet really, really nice. It just lacks oomph and energy and it's because she didn't really attack this moment and so she didn't attack it but she also isn't doing it in a slow controlled way either. It's just sort of somewhere in between and so it lacks clarity and interest and as the first movement of the whole choreography it's really important to grab attention and she doesn't do that. Pretty good three-step turn here. She's staying on the balls of her feet. She does use her hips occasionally as her pivot point, but for the most part, the balls of her feet are her pivot points, which is exactly how we want to do it. She is somewhat spotting her head. You can see that her gaze is kind of towards her arm here, which means that her gaze is further than the rest of her body as she's turning. And so that shows that she's trying to spot her head. I'd love a bit more specificity with the hands here, though. It just looks a little bit asymmetrical and in unintentional. Oops, let me go back. Great attack here right on the beat, but again I'd love to see her hold that shape before dropping it here. Good footwork again. She was on the balls of her feet until this last moment Which helps her to be more efficient and smooth this foot came out quickly and back behind her again So this is a good section for her. It looks really strong She finishes her layout by bringing the working leg back towards the standing leg, and that's not typical for a layout. It's much more interesting and beautiful and effective if you can actually aim to step further out away from your working leg. And part of the reason that she ends up bringing this foot back is because this knee was straight, and so she doesn't really have anywhere to go except backwards towards that knee, and so it loses the bigness, an exaggerated shape that it could have. This is nice. She brought this up in a really sharp dynamic and the hands look really strong. She did a little flick of the wrist as she brought the hands up, which looks great. I love that she's got a nice straight knee here, actually, because it helps to just emphasize the tightness of the shape. That was really nice. She did a sharp blade with this arm and is now bringing it around her body to help her with this turn, really good attack. Good job with this arm movement here. She's done a very sharp dynamic and brought the arms straight up into really nice shape Good fist there looks really strong and clear holds it for long enough for it to read this Leg looks really strong because she's leading with the knee but she's getting and she's getting the knee really high without having to arc the Pelvis forward or bend this knee very far, which means that she has good Flexibility through her hamstrings so she can bring the knee up but keep her posture pretty strong Also, she's pushed into the floor with this foot which I can tell because she's currently in a plantar flex position that's helping to add a nice sharp dynamic but also helping to bring the knee up further and Having the foot plantar flexed here also makes for a really nice line So she's just walking backwards here. I would love to see her make this more exaggerated not only because it would be more interesting to look at but would be a better preparation for what she's going to do next because it would build up momentum. So I'd love to see more of a leap rather than a walk backwards. Pretty good attack with these arms and a really nice pathway bringing them down out and up in a nice arc really strong through the arms here great angle of the shoulders nice straight elbow energy out the fingertips and a graceful bevel of the wrist. Good shimmy, really, really good shimmy. Nice and strong. She understands the mechanics of how to do it back and forth. She did it in a really sharp way. The arms look really strong and clear and are helping to exaggerate rather than detract from the shimmy. Great arm arc from the front to the back here. I'd like to see, well, that's actually really nice. She's doing a nice curve here with some energy at the fingertips. This is also a strong shape. Again, lacking attack, lacking energy, lacking personality, lacking pizzazz. I'd love to see partly why that's happening is because she's just kept her head in the same position as the previous moment. So if she could add something here, maybe looking over her shoulder or following her arm with her head, something to just give it a little bit more pizzazz. So here she's sort of I think was supposed to do a body roll but again really stiff through her spine and so she doesn't quite achieve that and it looks very stiff.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Both the upper and the lower octaves are sounding about the same and there's not a lot of discernible difference of when the finger is pressed down on the key. So she's doing a good job of coordinating both hands and blending the sound of both hands together. As she's playing the faster scale, she's keeping her fingers really close to the keyboard of the instrument. So her fingers aren't raising off the keys very far, but they're just staying very close. So she's being very efficient with her finger usage. She's now playing a chord cadence by using different inversions of different chords to just go through different progressions, common chord progressions on the piano, and she's playing them with all the accurate notes and she's still keeping that nice curved hand shape which allows her to get a good tone from the piano. She then played a three octave scale twice as fast, so still same fingerings but showing some good control and being able to double the speed of the tempo and also extend the range of the scale as well. As she's changing hand positions, you can't really see her hands do anything weird. They are just staying straight in this neutral position here. She's not doing anything weird with her elbows, or she's not doing anything where she's tilting her hand to get to the next hand position. She's just keeping that neutral hand position, that aligned spine, and she's able to make those hand position changes very smoothly. Musically speaking, she's doing a really nice job of bringing out the top two notes, so sort of outlining the melodic part of the exercise a little bit more, which helps the musicality of the phrasing sound better and give the listener more something to listen for. She's keeping an incredibly steady tempo as she's playing this exercise as her hand position fans out. She's still keeping a very, very consistent speed and not really hesitating much between notes when she has to change hand positions. The piano player is sitting upright with an aligned back. She has her neck at a neutral position facing straight ahead, and her hands look curved with rounded hand shape, and those hands also look relaxed as well. So judging by her position, she's an experienced piano player who knows how to sit properly to get the best sound. In this technical exercise, she's having to sort of expand her hand outward and inward as she plays this very legato sequence of notes. The smooth connectedness of the notes sounds beautiful and she's doing a great job of keeping a gentle touch and not too much finger weight on all the notes. As she's expanding her hand, she's having to move her hands back and forth in this arrow here. She's doing a good job of just getting that control and being precise with the right notes even as she's expanding her hand position. She now just played a four octave scale going even faster. So this acceleration of the tempo demonstrates a really great control and also understanding of the beat division. So with the two octave scale, she played it slower. The three octave scale, she played it twice as fast. And then the four octave scale, she played it twice as fast as that. And so as she got to that fast tempo, you could hear all the notes cleanly and evenly, and she still maintained a neutral hand position throughout. Smooth connectedness of the notes and clarity of the notes, nicely done. She played a two octave C major scale with both hands together and she used all the correct fingerings and played all the correct notes and she did it with a very steady tempo as well. Nicely done.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He goes up on the balls of his feet. It looks like he's like almost shooting a free throw, which is fine. You don't really need to jump on your free throw. I would like to see some elevation, however, in this drill. Better here. Here's the rim. Here's a shooting arm. Great extension. Let's get that guide hand up. Again, let's bend those knees on our landing. Again, as he shoots, let's hold that follow-through. I mean, a lot of times hold it till it hits the ground. Again, he comes down, he's just straight up, you know, not bending his knees in a balanced, slow position. Again, I'd also like to see his feet more staggered, one foot in front of the other for better balance and control. Much better view here. I would like to get that guide hand elbow down more. It's kind of sticking out. Much better extension here of the shooting arm. Let's flick that wrist down, point those fingers down. And you could tell, you know, the ball's kind of like, just, it's not even spinning. I mean, it's kind of just like a knuckle ball and it's because of this guide hand is too much in the shot. Here he is shooting with his left hand. Love that the guide hand is here on the side. Much better extension here of the elbow. Again, would love to see some lift and elevation. Bend those knees, drop that hip and the butt down, and be a ready shooter, catch and shoot. Again, he's waiting on this pass, would love for him to kind of back up and step in to meet this pass and catch and shoot. Here he's, you know, here he's kind of taking his time, pausing. I mean, he's probably learning how to shoot here, which is fine, but in a game-like situation, you've got to catch and shoot quickly before the defense gets there. And I just really believe in practicing drills that are game-like. Love the lift here. Much better job of flexing and bending those knees. Would like to have more timing though of getting up off the ground as you lift it. Like he could be off the ground already as the ball is lifted up. But love how he's got his shooting hand behind the ball, that guide hand. Maybe a little bit on, it's hard to see in this picture, but maybe a little bit too far on the other side of the ball. The great lifting of the ball to get it up toward your forehead so it's not easily blocked. Yep, left arm, that's a shooting hand. Again, let's bend our knees as we come down on our landing. Here's a great look of his shot. Again, you can see where he's, as the ball's being released, this is actually a really good picture. He's shooting with both hands. It's just going to throw off the rotation of the ball. And, you know, in basketball, you love to have this backspin as the ball makes its way to the basket. Here, it's probably going to go side to side, hit that rim and go out. So let's establish a shooting hand. Here it is his left hand, but I think his guide hand is way too much in his shot. Here, you know, he just needs to do a better job of cocking that wrist back and then releasing it. His release is really good. I like the extension here and I like the guide hand there. Let's get that elbow, that guide hand elbow down parallel to the floor. Here the shooter at the foul line is a left-handed shooter. We'd love to see him, you know, back up and step into this pass. He's got very little lift or elevation here. But you can see the extension of that left arm. That looks really good, a snapping of the wrist, if you will, in this particular frame. The guide hand is here on the side. Looks pretty good in this shot. You can't really see the wrist coming down. We'll see that later on. Again, here's the basket. And in this particular view, everything's to the right. I mean, his shooting hand, that rim should be right here between, that should be the view. Everything here is to the right. He's kind of shooting across his body. His vision is over here, and it needs to be between. He should be looking between his left shooting arm and his guide hand. Again, get that guide hand elbow down and under, get it on the side, not too bad there. Let's flick that wrist down, snap those fingers down, great extension of the elbow. Again, let's elevate and lift. On the follow-through, pretty good here. Love that guide hand here to stay more in the picture here in the shot. You see here he drops it down. Let's keep that guide hand up. Again, we'd love to see him land, bending those knees. He's a little straight up on his landing. Let's cushion that landing, land on the balls of our feet. Great extension of the elbow. There you got it. There's the breaking of the wrist. Great look at the guide hand as it's not so much in the shot here. Good extension here of the legs. We'll again love to see him leave the floor here. Here as he shoots it, and this is what I'm talking about, I think he's a left hand shooter, but it seems like now he's shooting with his right hand. Definitely both hands are in the shot. It's just going to throw off the touch and the accuracy of the ball as it makes its way to the basket. This is what we call when you don't have a shooter's touch. Again, both elbows are pointed out, and you can see that in this picture here. I do love the elevation here, or the extension, I should say, of his hips. Here you do see a little bit of a snapping of the wrist, but you can see how that elbow kind of turns out to the left. We want to keep it parallel to the floor. In this particular frame, you know, he is kind of leaning, which is probably going to throw off the shot. Stay balanced and in control.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Also, creating more ball control and security going into the finish while creating a closer gap of releasing the ball quicker towards our target area while creating separation from opposing defenders in a game-like scenario, trying to take, steal, or strip the ball from the offensive player. Looking at the player go into his left-handed, Mikey and Leah pretend on the right frame. A slight improvement the player can make is to jump with full maximum effort, getting more lift off the ground, allowing the ball to gain more momentum, arc and accuracy to get above the rim, and also preventing opposing defenders in a game-like scenario, having easy access of trying to contest or block the offensive player's shot. Looking at the release of the player's right-handed mic and layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice again the player does a good job of having his shoulder square towards the back of the rim, allowing the ball to be directed in a better angle, traveling more accurately towards the target area as we look on the left side of the frame.

Looking on the right frame as our player is going into his left-handed mic and layup attempt, we can notice that the player did a decent job of stepping with his right leg. However, we want the player to jump off his right leg or off of two feet as the player is doing, allowing his shoulders to be squared towards the back of the rim. Going into his release. Also allowing his body's momentum to carry him towards the left side of the frame, allowing the ball to gain the proper momentum, power, arc, and accuracy to get above the rim, hitting our target point. Looking at the release of the players left-handed mic and layup attempt, we can notice on the left frame, the player does a great job of getting his fall through, going in wrist, going towards the direction of the rim, allowing the ball as we see to create the proper spin and rotation it needs to get above the rim, to hit around our target area, which is going to be the top left corner of the box on the backboard, allowing the ball to create the proper angle it needs of dropping inside the rim. We also want the player to bring his ball placement position above his shoulder area to create separation from opposing defenders in a game-like scenario, being able to strip, take, or steal the ball from the offensive player. Looking at the player go into his right-handed, Mike can lay up attempt on the right frame.

The notes are heard with a stronger attack and a louder dynamic at the start of each pitch. Again, here the pianist is doing a great job with phrasing. They are slowing down toward the end of this phrase, which will make it sound more musical and finished. The pianist is continuing to play with a beautiful, delicate, and legato sound throughout this phrase. Here there was the slightest bit of hesitation when beginning this next phrase. It would help to practice the last few notes in the previous phrase leading into the beginning of this new phrase a few times to get more comfortable with this transition. Here the pianist is beginning their next section of the phrase a tempo or at their original speed. Here they are playing some accents or notes that are more emphasized and stressed in the right hand part. Here they are achieving good balance. You can hear the melodic line played in the right hand louder than the more accompanimental part in the left hand. The pianist is continuing to play with great pitch and rhythmic accuracy and they are achieving good balance. The melodic line is heard louder over the accompaniment part. Here the pianist is gradually slowing down to make the end of this phrase sound more musical and more complete. The pianist is continuing to shift to different spots on the keyboard effortlessly. Again here the low E flat stuck out and was heard much louder than the rest of the notes in this phrase due to the nature of the instrument. The pianist did not play this note louder on purpose. You can see both the left hand and right hand fingers are expanded to cover a wider range of notes. And the pianist seems to be doing this with ease. Here an incorrect pitch was played by the left-hand pinky and the pianist quickly corrected their mistake and did not let this affect the rest of the phrase. The pianist is demonstrating a beautiful legato sound with their right hand fingers. Their notes are smooth and connected and you can see the right hand fingers are curved over the keys of the piano. The pianist is playing broken chords that are very staccato or short and separated in their left hand and they are playing the more melodic line in their right hand. So far they are demonstrating great pitch and rhythmic accuracy. The left hand has been shifting back and forth to different spots on the keyboard effortlessly, and you can see now the fingers are expanded to cover a wider range of notes. Here the low E flat is heard somewhat louder than the rest of the pitches in this phrase due to the nature of the instrument. The pianist is not pressing any harder when playing this particular pitch. Here the tempo fluctuated the slightest bit or slowed down a little bit. It seemed like there might have been some hesitation with this phrase. It could help to review the phrase hands separately a few times and hands together to gain more confidence with this phrase and to be able to maintain a more steady playing speed here. The left hand is also playing with a beautiful legato articulation. They are playing longer held chords in the left hand part. Here you can see the left hand shifting back and forth a lot to cover a wider span of notes. Each time they are shifting they are landing on the correct key and correct pitch that comes next in the phrase. Here you can see the right hand fingers are extended to cover a wider range of notes.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Often what happens is when dancers get very nervous or they're having to do very difficult choreography, the energy in their body tends to stop at their wrists because they're nervous or they're thinking really hard about what the next step is supposed to be. So really loosen those hands and let the energy flow through the fingertips. Set this, make it clearly that it's supposed to be an advanced piece of choreography and have the execution of a professional dancer. While the dancer has their arm up when they're standing in this section, I would encourage them to think about every part of their body, including their fingertips while their arm is up. So it looks like their arm was kind of in this crumpled ball position, but I couldn't really tell if it was supposed to be a fist. Was it supposed to be a flexed hand? Was they supposed to be pointing up? So having energy throughout those fingertips takes this advanced choreography to the next level. The dancer does puts a great amount of effort into moving side to side, to wiggling their shoulders, to moving their arms, to moving their head. So they're really thinking deeply about moving every single part of their body. But I think they should take the time to really nail what each part of the body is doing. What are the legs? How are the legs moving? How are the arms supposed to be swaying? How should the shoulders be moving? What direction is the head looking? What part of the foot are they tapping into? If they take the time to really learn each of those parts and solidify all of those parts, then they can stack all of these movements on top of each other to create this polyrhythm while being on the music. That's what makes it the advanced choreography and the advanced execution of the choreography. Overall, I want to say that this dancer did a really great job and put in a really nice effort. You can see that they were actively thinking about the steps and making corrections in their body as they moved along. So that is a very challenging skill, especially in advanced choreography. So kudos to them for really attempting to work on this and get better with each second that passed by. I will repeat my earlier comment about musicality, about bending those legs, about having power through those arms. really great effort for this dancer to turn and carve and take up space. I think they can even push their limits even further and step out of their comfort zone by carving through space even more and taking bigger steps, reaching their arms even further, circling that chest even bigger, bending those knees even further, moving those hips even further side to side. The one thing that they're doing really great at is moving, engaging their head in this, which a lot of other dancers and other videos didn't do, so kudos to them for that. I would encourage the dancer to really plie or to bend their legs, to really move those hips side to side and get this deep, very passionate sway happening early in the music to set the tone for the rest of the dance. Here, the dancer does a great job of being on the rhythm. You can see their feet are moving side to side. But I will reiterate my earlier comments about making sure that they are stacking and being very intentional about moving each part of their body. Overall, really good job of finding that rhythm and sticking to it. The dancer puts a great amount of effort into moving their hips side to side to look a little less stiff while they're doing this movement. I would reiterate some of my earlier comments as well as encourage them to plie or bend their legs. If they bend their legs, they would have greater range of motion to be able to move those hips on this kind of pendulum swing side to side. I would also encourage the dancer to really study the rhythms and the music because at this moment they're off of the music which is very essential to advanced choreography to be on the music and to have that musicality and grace.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Now, it's important where the exact placement of the hand should be as the climber is making a dynamic move. Once the climber gets to make this placement, the climber is doing this with an open hand, so friction must be applied, which the climber will have to send his center of gravity and weight onto the higher hand by pressing down on it and creating friction. So now the climber was able to make that reach for the many components that requires up for the reach. And we can see how the left leg is still extended. This to help the climber have balance. Here we can see the climber performing a foot swap, where the climber glances over quickly to make sure that he has enough space for the foot. Knowing that the foothold is big, the climber is able to comfortably jump out of the left foot out of placement and decides to bring the right toe into placement. If the climber was to attempt this again, the climber will have to really apply sufficient pressure on the throw. And it's important that the climber does this quickly, as the climber will automatically have their feet peel off the wall. And it's important that the climber also gets to hang on to the grip with the left hand, being the pinch that he was holding on before. Here we can see the climber starting at a one hand hold start. So this is when both hands get to be placed on the same hold. This is called matching. The type of the hold that the climber is holding onto is onto a pinch hold, meaning that the climber will be using the hands and pinching onto that hold, which he does this with both hands. Now, having the thumb underneath will help the climber generate a lot of power grip while keeping in place, thinking as a clamp, and to generate power from the top fingers that are already placed on an edge, the climber must create pressure by leaning back on those holds. As we can see, the climber has the left foot placed onto the wall, and the type of hold that it is down at the bottom is a big foot hold, so it sticks out and the front of the toe box is pressing against that hold. Now the climber will be able to start to climb on hill until he gets his right foot off the ground. Here we can see the climber wasn't able to apply sufficient pressure on the right hand. This is necessary as due to the dynamic move, the other parts of points of contact would potentially be compromised as they would be relying on the body weight transfer to be on the top hold. The climber also needed to sustain the grip on the left hand as naturally as the climber will have their feet come off the wall. And so potentially if the climber was to sustain that right hand hold, then the climber would have to pull himself in. Here we can see the climber getting prepared to make a dynamic move. Now the climber would most likely be sending the direction of the throw from the foot. This one, the right foot being placed, helps the climber not only to keep his right side against the wall but also for him to gain leverage in the direction that he needs to go. But in order for him to gain more leverage when making the stance going up will be from the pull of the hand. So the arm will have to come tightly onto a pull up that will bring his chest towards the wall first as he stands up for the direction. Now the left leg being open meaning not in any foot placements, the climber is bending the leg. When he gets to do the stance he will extend that left leg. The left leg will act as a position where the climber will get to help with the propelling by extending it to gain more force when at the throw. Here we can see the climber reaching up to the pinch holdout left. This is closed grip so the climber is trying to aim on staying at the bottom part of that hold. Having a closer pinch helps the climber generate more power and sustain the hold for a longer period of time. Also to create pressure the climbers is still leaning on the hold. As we can see he's right leg is extended and this is called flagging in. So the climber in this instance has brought the right toe to push against the wall and this is helping the climber to keep their hips close to the wall as he would need to be leaning onto the right side. And to keep the hips square as well meaning to bring the hips close to the wall. As we can see he's brought his left leg to be open stance by keeping the knee being out pointing out to the left opening up the hip.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This is a good practice. It can be removed prior to cutting a whole tomato or half a tomato. Or for example, if you are quartering the tomato, you can easily remove the piece of core once the tomato has been quartered. Here the individual is peeling the cucumber and just allowing the peelings to drop onto the counter. A better practice would be to have a small bowl or container that you could put all your cooking scraps into as you go along keeping a neater tidier kitchen. The salad is mixed well, however it is not tasted and it's always good practice to taste your finished dish and adjust seasonings as necessary. You can see here a paring knife has been selected as the tool to cut the tomato and the cucumber. A better selection here would be a chef's knife, which would give the user a bit more control. And it's always important to ensure that any knife used is very, very sharp. Failure to use a sharp knife can result in the knife slipping while cutting, especially through something like tomato skin, and result in cutting the individual using the knife. Here, pepper and a small amount of oil was added to the chopped cucumber and tomato. In addition to these two ingredients, salt would be an excellent addition. It will take away the flat taste that a dish has when it's lacking salt. In addition to balance the oil and acid, such as lemon juice or red wine vinegar, should be added just to enhance the flavor. Here, while cutting the cucumber, the individual is using the flat side of the cucumber directly onto the cutting board. This is a great practice that helps to minimize the rolling of any round fruits or vegetables when cutting, and therefore preventing any possible accidents. Here the cucumber is being peeled for the salad. There is not a right or wrong way when making a cucumber tomato salad as to whether or not you peel the cucumber or leave the skin on.

And he does that a lot when he's changing direction and trying to go from as he was going this way and he's trying to go the opposite way. I mean this is really clear by how low his hips have sunk, how much he's bending that support knee. You can see his heel is making full foot contact here. It's slightly lifted but you know he's not he's like he's able to spring off this foot put a lot of force into it and start to move in that direction. His upper body is in balance, his arms are out to the side consistently and this is good. So now he can bring this left foot, catch this ball, manipulate it, move in that direction. But the like his lowering incentive of gravity is helping him with balance. If he had a direct opponent, somebody who was trying to get the ball from him and applying pressure or even making contact with him, he'd be difficult to push off the ball because he's so low to the ground. So, with each step that he makes as he takes these kind of smaller steps, he's like if he was running faster, the distance between these steps would be bigger. But he's just taking smaller steps that are quick steps. And each time that ball moves out in front of him, he's trying to bring another foot to make contact with the ball and keep it in close connection with the ball and then how he moves. And this is just a picture of that. And this is a common part of the foot that you can manipulate the ball with. It's almost like the toe. It's kind of like he's pushing it out in front of him just with that top part of his toe box here. To do that, he's trying to get his knee more over the ball so that he can hit it with that. And that also leads to a better running stance, a more natural kind of running position. So I just wanted to point out that, that he's touching the ball often. You can see his upper body is relaxed. Like his arms are out to the side and in a good position. He looks like he's in control of the ball and the ball is not in control of him. So this is interesting as he's dribbling with the ball of a way in which because he has like good efficiency with the ball he could start to do patterns for himself that would challenge like how he moves with the ball. So one example here is that he's doing is he's dribbling with the ball and he's putting his foot on top of the ball to stop and then start again or he could pull it and change direction. Now that's interesting. Now he's done a lot of changing direction in this in this exercise but this could be something like touch, touch, stop the ball, touch, touch, stop the ball, right? Touch, touch, change direction. And then there's like create little patterns for himself to be able to practice like repetitive tasks but challenge like memory as well of like the of like the pattern that he could do. This could be a way to for him just because he's so comfortable with the ball and he's running out of ideas of what to do of how to like continue to push himself and develop himself in the exercise because he could do this with like a strong foot for a certain time period then he can move to his left foot and do it for a certain time period but different ways to increase the overall like difficulty for him. So, one thing to point out in relation to turning with the ball, he hasn't up until this point really shown elements of fatigue or signs of fatigue, but he is starting to. It's 90 seconds into the exercise and there's a lot of movement that he's done over the course of 90 seconds. So, he's starting to naturally slow down. On his turn here, to help him, one thing that I would suggest that he does is as he turns with the ball here, he's got to get it out into a place here where he could then turn and he could start to run and he could meet the ball. Because he's losing a little bit of his energy, this was like a weak touch as he manipulated the ball underneath him, so now it's kind of staying underneath his body too much. And that's going to just, he's going to have to slow down, he's going to have to be a little bit more upright, catch the ball, restart dribbling again, versus be able to turn and move if he hit the ball more out to here. As he fatigues, I think he really needs to stay focused on the execution of the technique, the way that it's touched, etc. and just really try to push through and don't let moments like this, because this is inefficient, start to come out more and more as he gets tired. So the subject is performing a close control, freestyle dribbling exercise, where he's just being asked to stay in this space and manipulate the ball and change direction and move with it efficiently as best he can. And what we're seeing right away from him is, well, I like seeing from him right away, is the distance that the ball is away from his body is good. It's slightly out in front of him, not too far out in front of him and not too far underneath him. It's in that middle space. And he's also moving with the ball as it's out in front of him here. And I think that's great. So his coordination of how he moves with the ball is important, but that's also direct related to like the distance the ball is consistently being away from his body. So he keeps it out in front of him. That's great. You can see that he's really bending through his knees to lower his center of gravity, which will give him more balance and better ability to change direction as he gets there. He's slightly, ever so slightly bent over with that upper body. He could be even more, a little bit more bent over, getting his head a little bit more over the ball, but he is tracking it with his eyes. You can tell that that's occurring. So I like this picture of how like he's coordinated and moving with the ball at the same time. This is a good starting point. Yeah, I love this because he just brought the ball across his body this way. He fainted like he was going to catch the ball with his left foot and push it back this direction. But what he's actually doing is he's bringing the left foot here to plant it now. So it's a body feint to go this way. And then he's going to bring this foot to push it and go that direction. He's set up to do that at this moment. And this is great. You can see one thing that I love about it is that he's lowering that center of gravity down. His knees are really bent. His upper body is over the ball. He's not straight up and down. The ball is a good distance away from his body. It's just out in front of him. So it's close enough for him that he can manipulate it and go different directions. This is a very good picture of like the like his ability to do different skills and change up the variation of what he's doing, but also be in a in a body position where he could explode this direction or he could explode this direction. I like to see this. This is a skill move that he likes to use. It seems to be something that he's very comfortable with. It's called a scissors. So as he's dribbling, and again, the distance the ball's away from his body is directly related to his ability to use different skills. He is now able to bring a foot around the ball, plant the foot here. He could do multiple scissors. That's a scissors move. He could do it on both sides where he does one, then he does the other, but he's very comfortable in bringing this foot around the ball because it's a good distance from his body. It's not too far out. He can maintain balance. Then as the ball continues to move forward, he could catch the ball with this other foot, or he could do the same thing. He could do another scissors by bringing this foot over in this direction. He has a lot of possibilities here, but it's all directly related to how fast he's, or how he's manipulating the ball. The distance it is from his body consistently, being slightly in front of him. The strength of his touch is always consistent. So he's not out of control. His upper body is relaxed. His arms out to the side. He's tracking the ball with his eyes, head down over the ball here in this situation. So like a total control in this picture, and this is good. You can tell that he's very comfortable manipulating and dribbling the ball. So because he keeps his body in good distance relation to the ball He's able to change direction much more quickly And then if the ball was like further away from him he had to keep catching up to the ball So what he can do is just change direction at any moment's notice And you can tell here that this foot the plant foot here is not fully like heels not down on the ground He's maintaining like a ball of the foot contact here as he's pivoting and turning on this to change direction Because he maintained a good distance from the ball He can use different surfaces to manipulate the ball underneath them to push the ball in that direction Here he's using what's called a Cruyff where you're basically wrapping your foot around the ball Using the inside of the foot to sort of to hit the ball with one touch underneath his body and then move in that direction So I like that with his knees being so far bent his hips are down towards the ground Which is great because once he touches this ball and he's turning and pivoting he can plant these feet and he can Push off the ground and create a lot of force to go in the other direction More quickly and he's pretty good balance here. He's not his body's not too far leaning back that direction I like where he's trying to go with this with this turn So this is a good picture But I just wanted to point out like how he's dribbling the ball in relation to his body allows him To very quickly change direction. So this is a good picture of that", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

We see that her left knee here is bent, so that bending of the knee is what's going to allow her to catapult into the air. That's great. And as well in this turn, it was forceful because her head and her neck leads it. So while she looks to the side of the room or the diagonal corner, she also turns her head very strongly in that direction, leading that turn. The dancer just executed really good spinal articulation when she rolled her body. The movement started from the top of her spine and went sequentially downward. The dancer does a really good job of being on her releve or what is her tippy toe here When she's turning so we see again her heel is raised off the ground when she's turning And that helps her pull really high in her verticality and not be elongated The dancer has great foot articulation here. She's stepping on her toes when she moves her feet forward in front of her and her heel is raised high off the ground, so really showing off that foot arch. However, dancer needs to be a little careful because she is a double jointed. So we see here her elbow looks like it's almost Bending backwards in the opposite direction. It's just because she has extra flexibility in that joint So even though she's extending her arm fully, which is great. She actually has to move her elbow joint a little Further downward and to her right so that it is a true straight line right now I will join breaks that line because of That extra flexibility she has There so for the line to be a true straight line. She actually sounds counterintuitive But she needs to bend her arm slightly or just not straighten it as fully as she is The dancer execution of this hip twist is really good. She has a large range of motion here. She's twisting towards her right to a great extreme so that both of her toes face towards the right wall. And she's able to twist so well and to such a great extent because her weight is on her toe, her heel is lifted in the air. So that is allowing her to have this great motion of the twist that's happening from her hips all the way downward. The dancer does a good job of straightening her arm completely and extending that line fully here in her right arm. The dancer turns with great force and has great energy. We see here her ponytail swinging in the wind which is a really great indication of the force that she had in that turn. The dancer just has to be careful here with her ankle alignment on her left foot Her heel is pulled a little too far to her left Her heel should really be pulled to her right so that it is on the inside of her toe That is on the floor. It shouldn't be aligned with it. This is actually Close to sickling her foot, which is a misalignment for dancer.

When the dancers release from each other and create space, the dancer can be straightening his arm completely. It's bent here at the elbow. The dancer is bending his knees well which is making him able to be mobile in this space and transfer his weight easily. The dancer is opening his ribcage here on the turn, which contributes to him not being completely balanced. So instead he needs to pull his ribcage towards the center of his belly button and close it. This movement can be stronger if he was to lean even further though, and he could do that by bending his knee more. The dancer here is doing a good job of leaning his hips in the opposite direction of his front foot. So his right, I'm sorry, his left foot is in front. Therefore, he's moving his hips towards the right in opposition. The dancer should be looking more directly at his partner. His partner's head and face are below his middle range of vision. So he should be looking further downward so that her face is at the middle of his view. However, he pulls her in with good force, leading with his left arm, so he is able to, as a leader, establish an adamant control of the dancer, or his partner. This is another circumstance where the dancer is looking completely beyond his partner And he really needs to be looking at his partner so that they have a connection And this is a bit difficult because he is taller than her. They do have a height difference. So it just has to be more purposeful when he's making eye contact with his partner to look further downward.

The one thing that the climber needs to really make sure they focus on is continuing to transition over that left foot just because it is guiding them in the direction that they need to go to so the more that they can transition their body weight over that left foot the better it's going to be and give them a better chance of hanging on to the hold overall. And so here we can see the climber is getting closer to that yellow hole that they're aiming for But as they're doing that we can see that their left foot has now slipped off of the foothold It almost kind of seems as if the climber was trying to make this a powerful Dynamic move or they kind of had to jump off that foot in order to reach it But by doing so they did place the rest of the body kind of hanging out away from the wall now Because their foot is no longer on that foothold So what I would encourage for the climbers to continue to transition Their left knee over that left foot and making sure that left foot stays in that foothold Which will give them the best chance of gathering on to that yellow hole they're aiming for and continue further movement after that", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

It's kind of a lot more like this, not super fluid. And this is going to reduce the amount of power that the climber can put into this big powerful move.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

However, they still are lacking groundedness in their lower body, which is keeping them from fully embodying the rhythm. As the dancer begins with the basic salsa steps, staying in place, shifting their feet, alternating the weight in between their feet from side to side. They show that they have an understanding of the movement vocabulary. However, it appears to be fairly beginner. They're really struggling to embody the rhythm. It would really benefit them to bend their knees and drop their weight in their pelvis backwards so that they were able to ground through their movement, as well as create a little bit more distance between their feet to activate a greater range of motion in their lower body as well as their pelvis. And in general, just incorporate some additional polyrhythm into their shoulders and their torso. As a dancer performs a series of pivot turns around themselves, they're able to do so quickly and efficiently, particularly thanks to the spotting of their head. However, as they're performing these turns, they are remaining quite stiff through their torso and their pelvis, which is keeping them from fully embodying the rhythm and demonstrating this turn as effectively as they could. As a dancer performs a cross step crossing one leg over the other and then alternating sides, they're able to stay a bit more connected to the rhythm than prior, particularly through their footwork. However, because they're not bending their knees or dropping their pelvis back and not therefore not being grounded in their movement, they're really lacking the range of motion necessary in their pelvis, their torso, and their shoulders. They would also benefit from some more clarity in the choreography of their arms.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So he has the left foot on and to kind of bounce, he doesn't do a backflip, but he does kind of drop that foot off so he can be left hand on right foot on. It kind of does open his body up and away, and this is kind of be a little bit more core tense. So I think the move here, I'm going to leave the left foot here and twist this right knee down and in. So that way you kind of bring your hip into the wall and kind of twist over it. And then again he starts kind of doing this weird dropping the left arm super far down low. I don't know if it's to rest. He's not really hanging it long enough to probably get anything back. So maybe he's just going for style points. But whatever it is, he's got to kind of relax on this side and he's got to kind of pull it back through and regain. So it kind of seems like a wasted movement when his arm could just stay on or stay closer. So you don't have to move it as much or swing it around as much. And notice as he moves that right arm, his body position doesn't even shift at all. And as he kind of goes to take more weight to that right arm, he's able to shift that right foot back out and get opposite pose by being right hand, left foot on. Then puts the heel up and right to try to make this last move of finishing out. This kind of looks like a sloper. Doesn't look like the most positive. So hopefully that heel hook, what it's going to do is going to take the place of his right arm. So as he gets his left arm here, that heel hook will free up the right arm. So I think what it is, it's placed maybe a little bit prematurely. And so what he wants to do is hit the hand first, then set the right heel hook so he can move the right hand. And again, kind of feet cutting here, causing him to kind of pull up. So now it seems like maybe he is getting a little bit tired, isn't able to maintain that good positioning. So he's kind of taking more of the weight to his arms. Then he kind of shakes out the right arm again and relaxes the right foot, which kind of makes him barn door a little bit because now he's left hand, left foot. So you can see his whole body kind of just rips out. So that's where you want to stay. You know, if we are going to rest and do all this stuff, we want to make sure we're in a good position, really have the legs tensioned up and loaded up so they can take as much weight while we're on one arm. So we're off to a good start this this kind of starting position is really scrunchy He'll notice he kind of really loads up this left foot. So when he starts off to the right You know, he's toned down a little bit more like this and his knees over here to the right But as he pulls into he pulls that knee up and over So he can really shift his weight over that hole and kind of perch on to it So really thinking with the with the lower feet You know with the legs and the waist and what his torso was doing before what his arm is doing And again kind of resting out shaking that right arm out trying to get something back. Yeah it doesn't seem like it's been long enough to have to shake out. Or he's kind of doing this arm drop thing like he did in the move before. And for this move, this undercling, this is one of those moves where you really can't pull harder into it and pull yourself up. You've got to really drive those feet. Left leg does pick off, so maybe having a higher foot or kind of twisting this right knee more into it so you can kind of post more on that left foot would save this little foot cut. But overall, it doesn't seem to hold them back too much. And we can kind of see him position out too. So as he makes that first move, rocking over that knee, he kind of sinks into this left arm. So now he's left arm, left foot. So instead of foot swapping, he kind of just brings this right foot slightly behind it, kind of pokes it up into a nice little back leg so that way he can balance out and move that right arm freely.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She needs to find some additional clarity and refinement in her footwork, as well as the choreographic inclusion of her arms.

Good extension here. I'd just like to see that elbow come in a little bit. She needs to snap that wrist down. And then that guide hand, again, it looks like she kind of, it's, it's got some sort of movement here. Could be kind of throwing off that, off the shot as well. Here she's dribbling. Again, you're going to be defended and guarded. And you know, she's dribbling with the left hand and she's a right-hand shooter. Again, it's a jump shooting drill. We don't need this dribble here. And then look how she looks down. You know, you lose sight of your target. Beautiful verticality. I love to see that follow through that with that elbow in, more in line with the rim and the basketball, kind of coming across her body. And just the consistency is just snapping down that wrist so that we continue to get that backspin on the basketball as it makes its way to the basket. And then she kind of seals, she locks it out. Again, off balance, follow through. Here's the basketball. See, now she's really off balance. Look at her trying to... she's leaning forward on these toes. I think the ball hit the rim and popped out, but she's still up on her toes. She should be down, you know, soft landing, bent knees, butt down. Again, we just need better flow and consistency here. Here's the shot, you know as she jumps, you know, we just got to have really like good timing and flow here I love that she's jumping and getting up Extending the hips. We just need a little softer, you know Touches that ball leaves the hand get that elbow in let's snap that wrist down It could have been how the ball sitting on this hand initially, you know We just wanted to come off those fingertips with a nice rotation and backspin Not sure where the guide hand is here. We'd love to see that in the in this view as well Here she dribbles. Again, we don't really need a dribble. We need to catch and shoot the ball quickly. Unless it's a free throw, you know, we gotta, you don't have time to take a dribble here in front of you. You're gonna be guarded and defended and not be able to shoot at all. So be ready shooter. Step into this pass. You know, really get ready by dropping the hips, bending the knees, stepping those feet. One, two, catch and shoot. Gotta be a little bit quicker. Again, look at the landing. See all the weight on that right foot and knee. Left leg kind of pops back. She pulls that follow-through back. Let's hold it out there until it, you know, she might have a little too much arc on it. You know, we don't, we don't need quite that much. Again, it's got to travel so far here. Let's take a little bit off of that. Hold that follow-through though. Stretch that arm and keep it out there. See how she starts her shot from here? She kind of pushes it. I think that's probably why she's off target some here. You know, we want to, you know, you don't want to really dip it down and obviously you don't want to push it from your, from your belly button. You want to raise it and then shoot it. She's shooting it from here. So again, it's got just a long ways to go here. Probably off target. I like her knees bent. Let's spray those feet a little bit as well. Again, here's her landing, a little off balance, you know, on the balls of her feet. The knees are really, a lot of the weight's out here on these knees. Again, let's hold that follow-through out instead of bringing that right arm back. She's kind of jerking it back, which could cause the ball to go off target here. And then, you know, the landing, again, a lot of her weight is on this right foot. We want to land evenly here. Just be balanced, cushion landing. Hold that follow-through again. Let it follow the ball to the basket. Not, we don't want it to go straight up. Again, much better landing on two feet. Maybe drop the knees a second, a little bit here, but again hold that phalla out. Let's not jerk the arm up and back. Stay with it. Again, a little better here starting the shot up a little higher instead of here. So that's much better point of release. That guide hand comes off. Here she's raising the ball a little higher. Let's spread our feet so we can lift and push and have a good base that supports us. Yeah, it hits far right, I think right here. Again, off balance landing. We just gotta really work on having more of a balanced landing, cushion, spread our weight evenly across both feet. Here's the follow-through. The arm is extended. However, it's kind of the elbows popping out. You know, we want to line everything up here, the ball to the rim. Snap that wrist down. Good extensions. You does this really well. We just got to work on the jumping and and make it a little bit more smoother, softer. And again, she could start in close, add the little simple jump here. Nice and easy touch. Again, kind of starts her shot I noticed like from here. That may have a little do with how she's shooting it so hard. But this looks nice. But it's kind of, you could tell here, she's kind of shooting the ball really low. So it's kind of pushing it instead of lifting it up here and then shooting it. She's starting her shot really down low here. And that might be why it's hitting the rim so hard as well. Here's that guide hand. It looks bent, which is what we want. But let's get this guide hand facing in. You know, it was on the ball initially. Let's just not have any movement with it. Keep that palm facing the basketball. Here comes the shot again. See how she shoots it really low Instead of lifting it up here and shooting it. It's a little flat. I Mean, I love how the fingers come off, you know, that's that's good. And let's get this guide hand I'm not sure if it's in the shot or not We need it just to stay stationary, but she does jump. She does extend her hips Again, let's get that elbow in of the shooting arm. She does extend it, but we want it in line here with the basketball. Kind of pops out, comes across her body. Good push-off verticality. Hips are extended. Here the shooter shooting a mid-range jumper. I love that she's jumping and she's got her feet apart. Maybe square this left foot and knee more facing the basket. It looks like it's a little turned to the outside as I pause it here. Good extension of the hips. I'm looking at her follow-through. I mean, not bad. I'd get the elbow in a little bit more in line with the basketball, but she does extend that right shooting arm. You see the elbow extended out. It's a little fuzzy, but let's snap that wrist down, make it a little more fluid. I'm not sure what the guide hand is doing here. It looks like it's pulled back or curled back. Let's just keep it out there. Bent elbow, palm facing in. Again, here comes the pass, look where she caught it. So again, I just am a firm believer, like to be a great jump shooter, you gotta go meet this pass. And it's about being ready in between shots, stepping into it, bending the knees, dropping the hips, having the hands ready. You don't wanna step back. When you step back, that defender's got you. They're gonna get in your space and take away everything, shot, pass, et cetera. Here's her landing again, just the follow-through is way across her body. We want it to be more, you know, let's follow that, let's follow that basketball to the rim. Bend our knees, distribute our weight evenly across both feet, maybe hold that guide arm up for balance. Again, much better release here. Looks like she's snapping it down here. We gotta get this guide hand out of the shot and just let it stay stationary, but good ups here, good extension. Again, here's the ball. Again, that follow-through is really high. We want it to be more in line with the basketball. Better job of, you know, being soft here, a little knee bend here, which is nice to see on the landing. But her landing, all that weight landing on the right foot, she picks the left leg up. Again, let's have a smooth, consistent follow-through here. Here she jerks it back. Again it's probably going to throw off the ball in its rotation, in its flight path. I like her foot right foot out in front of the other and she does bend her knees but again it's all from this this positioning she's not really stepping into it so now she's having to use her legs but just going straight up there's no momentum like just like if you meet that pass you're stepping into it here is just really relying on just being able to lift her body up I like how she's looking over the top of the ball at her target Again, mid-range jumper. She is jumping. Nice job. Good extension of the hips. Again, we need that follow-through. There it's a little bit better here. There's the basketball. Eyes are up. A little flat. We'd like it to be a little more up. Just get that guide hand out of the shot. I don't have any idea what it's doing here. I just know how I want it to look. You know, and then here's her follow-through, there's the basketball. Maybe a little softer landing, bent knees, drop the hips, hold this follow-through. You want the arm to kind of, almost like it's following the basketball, so not straight up. And you know, we'd love to see it here in this ego view, it's kind of popping out if you will.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So then it looks like you're taking bigger steps on the step step step and then rock your hips and then step step step somewhere else, rock your hips. And I think that could have helped to make a little more sense with this dancer. Also I noticed her arms have not really moved, so by this point she definitely should have had a bit more upper body movement. The arms go up, sideways, down, just making sure there's something happening throughout the entire body. And here she's doing a kick with her right foot, just kicked up in the air, and then doing a little step with her left and back. Again, I think this movement just needs to be more defined. So if you're going to kick, fully kick, if you're going to step, take the full steps so it's very clear what it is you're doing. Right now, it again just looks a little jumbled up, and it's hard to tell what she's trying to do. So here she's doing just kind of a stepping side to side, taking three steps and then doing a little hip rock. Here she's definitely off the count of the music, so it doesn't really line up or sync up with what she's doing. So I would definitely suggest trying to get back on the music so you're on beat. But then also really accentuate and add more detail to the hips and the steps to the side, because it feels a little jumbled, and I'm just not quite sure what she's trying to do. I think this dancer has a lot they could work on, but I think the main thing is counting would definitely help. So that way they're keeping track of their steps and making sure they're staying on the music. And then of course using the full body, adding the arms and also using more of the space. So here she's kind of doing like a Charleston variation. She's adding a little extra step in on her left foot, but she is kicking that leg out. I would suggest maybe pointing this toe just for a nice presentation. But again, I think counting and being on the music would help her a lot, just an overall presentation, because it's not really blending well with the music or making sense to the viewer. So here again she is doing her step side to side and then doing a little hip rock. So I was trying to count it out and there really isn't a clear pattern. Definitely for a beginner basic learner you want to make sure the patterns are very clear because they're not at the level where you can do just different timing just to you know make them understand the steps easier. So definitely thinking about like making it the timing a lot clearer so that way you're on the music and it just makes sense to whoever's trying to learn the steps. So the dance just starts with a kind of a step and glide, step glide, step glide. So you're stepping one foot forward and then sliding it in, then steps the other foot forward and slides it in, and as she slides it stays on the floor. Here's one of the very few times where she was actually on the correct beat, so just making sure you are dancing on the with the right timing, but then also I would suggest maybe doing something with the arms just because it opens up the show and it just looks a little dull just her feet doing that motion. So here she's like taking steps forward and kicking and it's not really consistent so again I can't really tell what step she's trying to do. So again just finding more clarity, finding the counts. I think counting out loud may have helped this dancer a lot just so she's staying on the beat and then giving each step is proper do that it needs for each count. So here she's just doing a step and toe touch back. So right now she just did a step on her left and her right foot is touching with the ball of her foot going back behind her. This is a really good simple basic step that she's doing and she's executing it correctly. But again just making sure she's on the correct timing for any student. So the hip swings I think could have been a bigger moment, especially because you hear the horns nice and full. So don't be afraid to move those hips if that's what you're going to do. Shake them and then also add some upper body arm movements as well.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The player also does really well at loading before going into his release, having his legs bent to ensure more power going into the release. He also does a good job of keeping his ball placement position above his shoulders, going into his shooting pocket to allow the ball to gain enough arc and power to get above the rim. As we look at our players release on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the players follow through is extended above his shoulder to allow the ball to gain the right amount of momentum and arc it needs to be able to have a chance of going inside the rim. The player also does a good job of getting a slight lift off the ground to again help the ball gain enough power and arc it needs to get above the rim. As we look on the left side of the frame, we can notice that on the player's release, his follow through was going the direction of the target towards the left of the rim, which allowed the ball to be directed towards the left of the rim, bouncing out, resulting in the incomplete attempted jump shot. We can notice on the right side of the frame that the player on his release Does a good job of getting his follow-through extended above his shoulder And also getting a slight lift off the ground to allow the ball to gain the right power momentum arc and accuracy it needs to get above the rim and develop a Slight angle of dropping through the net As we look at the player go into his jump shot attempt, we can notice that the player on the right side of the frame used one of the proper footworks by stepping initially with his left foot first and having his right foot come down second into his shooting motion. As we look on the right side of the frame we can notice that the player does a good job of getting his elbow Aligned towards the direction of our target which is going to be the rim and also does a good job Of getting a slight lift off the ground to help the ball create more power arc It needs to get above the rim To develop the proper angle of dropping inside the rim To create more arc and power for the ball, we want the player on the right side of the frame to keep his follow-through extended above his shoulder longer to allow the ball to gain more momentum and arc to get above the rim, and to have a more efficient probability of dropping through the net resulting in a completed attempted jump shot. However, the player still did a good job of extending his follow-through in order to allow the ball to gain the proper arc and power it needed to slightly get above the rim and still drop through the net resulting in a completed jump shot attempt. As we look at the release of the player's attempted jump shot on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player does really well at getting his shooting hand going downward towards the direction of the target, which is going to be the rim, snapping his wrist, allowing the ball to stay in the proper alignment it needs to be able to have the opportunity of completing the attempt. Thanks for watching! As we look on the right side of the frame on our players release attempt, we can notice that the players shooting hand is dropping below his shoulders too quickly. This does not allow the ball to gain enough arc and accuracy it needs to get above the rim to be able to develop the proper angle to go inside the rim. However, this allows the ball to stay kind of flat which it will hit the back of the rim bouncing out resulting in the incomplete attempted jump shot. As we look on the left side of the frame on our players release we can notice that the player does a good job of having his follow through, go downward, snapping his wrist towards the direction of our target which allows the ball to stay in the correct alignment it needs to have a greater chance of dropping inside the rim. The player also does a good job of having his guy hand on the side of the ball as a placeholder having no effect on the release of the shot. As we look at the player go into his mid-range jump shot attempt, we can notice on the right frame the player does a good job of incorporating one of the proper footworks into his attempt. On this particular attempt the offensive player is stepping with his right foot first and having his left foot go into his shooting motion. The slight adjustment we will want to make is from our player tucking his elbow inside his body frame. We'll allow the ball to stay in a better alignment it needs. And to have the offensive player snap his follow-through shooting hand going towards the direction of our target, keeping it in the correct alignment. A slight improvement as we can look on the right side of the frame on our player's shooting pocket to help the player become more efficient on his attempts is to keep his shooting elbow inside his body frame to help the ball stay in the correct alignment and ease to be guided properly through the right channel resulting in a completed attempt to jump shot. A slight adjustment we will want to make on our player's shooting pocket as we look on the right side of the frame is to tuck our player's elbow inside his body frame. This will help keep the alignment more accurately, guiding the ball towards the target area, which is going to be the front of the rim. As a result, we can look on the right side of the frame and notice that the ball had just enough power and arc to be able to drop inside the rim, resulting in a completed attempted jump shot. A slight adjustment to make the player create more arc on his shot is again to have the player keep his follow-through extended above his shoulder to create more arc and more power to get above the rim to have a higher chance of being more efficient on his attempted jump shot. As a result, we can see the balls landing on the right side of the frame on our players attempted jump shot. He had the right amount of power and force it needed to get inside the rim. A slight adjustment we will want to make to gain more arc for the players release is to have his follow-through extended above his shoulder. This will help gain more arc for the ball to have a better probability of dropping inside the rim. As we look on the left side of the frame on our players shooting motion, we can notice that the player does a good job of getting his shooting hand underneath the ball. This helps keep the ball in alignment towards the direction of our target, which is going to be the rim. It also helps ensure more ball control on the release.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Undercling is when is the palm facing up towards the hold as the jug is upside down and the climber keeps the thumb on the outside to create pressure on a pinch at the lip of the hold. For body movement the climber had dropped the left foot. This one with the left leg extended is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. The leg being extended this is for the climber to then keep balance over his her areas of support as she sends the arm over to the left side. The climber has only positioned the left toe into place while the right foot is out and extended in space. With the right leg extended, this is called flagging out, so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot. The climber is now leaning back, bringing her hips close to the wall to bring her center of gravity into the wall and not drop her weight. In doing so, the climber quickly makes a performance to the next hold, where she sends the left hand underneath the hold. However, the climber yet has not appraised the grip and potentially she will be sustaining onto the lip of the hold or repositioning herself. The climber had stepped off from the climb due to being restricted on the move. Ideally, if the climber wanted to bring the right hand grip to the undercling, the left toe being in position would have been a better option as she would be able to keep her left side of the body towards the wall and able to lean back comfortably while sustaining the right hand grip on the undercling. The climber in this position was restricted due to the inability of releasing the left hand with the right foot being in place. This was difficult for the climber to sustain because the undercling is being sustained from above her which makes it really difficult for the climber to secure the hand placement. The climber is approaching the wall to assess the moves on the climb from the ground. This will give an idea for the climber to visualize the moves that she will need to encounter when on the wall. The climber is able to secure the grip and this time applying even the palm towards the lip of the hold to create more friction of the skin towards the grip. As we can see the way that the climber is sustaining it, she has to be pulling it away from the wall. This is hard for the climber to do, a reason why the climber is leaning over on the opposite direction of the entry of the hold. The climber is glancing down at the feet to perform a foot switch. The way that she's performing the foot switch, she's bringing the right toe to come into place at the hold. Once the climber creates pressure of the left toe coming into place, the climber then releases the left foot. The climber is starting in a one-hold start where she places both of the hands onto the same hold. This is called matching and the climber is able to wrap the hands at the lip of the hold due to the hold being a jug. Now the climb will start when she is no longer standing on the mat and the feet are raised or placed onto the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

But when the dancer was moving the arms in front, it was almost like they had a drum beneath their arms that they were playing. So the dancer, I believe, should be pressing out while the body's going the opposite direction, and vice versa. The dancer is reaching out here. It's okay, obviously, if that's the choreography, but even if it's not, it does look uniform and it looks like that's what the dancer's supposed to do. That was their interpretation of the movement. So for this, it looks okay. You want to make sure that that is a reach and not so much a hop in that movement, where the arm reaches out to the right and the leg reaches out to the left. Here in placing the hands, probably would like to see them extended a little bit more. If the choreography is stylized for the dancer to just place the hand out, that works too.

So are they, when are they supposed to be on the ball of their foot versus when are they supposed to be whole foot versus when should they be like tapping the toe of the foot. I would encourage the dancer to be more grounded, so to plie more and to send their hips back a little bit further so it doesn't look like a march as opposed to like a grooving in this basic choreography.

This is a good technique so that the milk warms up to the temperature of the tea rather than bringing the temperature down by adding cold milk directly to the tea. Sugar is being added to the water before it comes to a boil. The thing to be careful about here is that the water is heated long enough to ensure that the sugar has been dissolved. Here he is using a strainer to strain out the loose tea leaves in the tea mixture. The strainer is being placed over the cup that the tea is being poured into. And this is the proper procedure. Now, if you were using a tea bag, there would be no need for a strainer as the tea bag contains all the tea leaves. Here a small saucepan has been selected to use to make the milk tea. This is the appropriate size and type of pan to use. One could also use a kettle, either an electric kettle or a kettle that you place on the burner to boil the water or milk. The individual preparing the tea has good control of the temperature, the flame, under the saucepan. He never allows the tea mixture to boil up and almost over the edge of the saucepan. It is always kept on a low boil and this is what you want to see. The tea leaves have now been added to the saucepan where the water is just starting to come to a boil. A better technique would be to boil the water and then pour the liquid over the tea leaves, either in a mug or a teapot, and allow the tea to steep for about three to five minutes. That way you're extracting out the most flavor. In this case, the milk tea is made primarily with water. Now this is totally acceptable. Tea is based on personal preference as far as taste.

The dancer has great placement of the arms and extension, as well as nice isolations in the hips, tapping the toes there while the weight is on the back foot. And this movement and the shoulders are isolated, isolating and keeping up with the beat and the rhythm. And the dancer has a very nice pace with the movement and the music.

It would help to practice these parts alone for a while. So the first violinist should practice their part individually, using a tuner if needed, and while watching the left-hand finger positions on the fingerboard. The second violinist should practice their part alone for a while as well, too, to work on intonation. And then they should practice together again, really listening to one another, watching their finger position for more accuracy and intonation of the pitches.

An accidental is when there's a note that's played that is not included in the key signature of the piece and instead either a flat, sharp, or natural sign is written in front of the note to indicate which pitch that it should be played as. Right before they stopped playing this phrase, the intonation between the two violinists was a bit off.

And this is, you know, very basic seasoning that's being used, which is fine. You can also add other dried herbs or fresh herbs or even some allium, such as shallots or red onion or scallions. The preparer is using a diagonal cut, a 45 degree diagonal cut on the cucumber. This is a more decorative cut. However, you can do a straight cut across creating half moons or half circles, or you could make an additional lengthwise cut on each half and just cut it into small cubes. The cucumber is being peeled here. When making a cucumber salad, it is not necessary to always peel the cucumber. So for just a run-of-the-mill traditional cucumber, it's going to have a slightly thicker skin than say a hothouse English cucumber or Persian cucumber. However, you can still leave the skin on or you can stripe the skin by alternating peeling. So you have green and light green, dark green, light green. With the Persian cucumber, the hothouse cucumber, it's really not necessary to peel. The preparer is using a commercial salad dressing, commercially prepared salad dressing, and this is absolutely fine. The benefit to that is that the flavors are well balanced in a commercial product, but it's still important once the salad is mixed to ensure that it is tasted to make sure that all the seasonings are well balanced because there was additional salt and pepper added. The cut of that first tomato is indicative of a dull knife. The preparer had to actually separate the two pieces of tomato that were initially cut in half. So a sharp knife will allow you to go through the skin of the tomato all the way through to the cutting board so that separation manually is not needed. Just noting that the vegetables are being used directly from the packaging. So the cucumber was taken out of the bag from the grocery store. The tomatoes are being taken out of the plastic container that they came in. It is important to make sure that vegetables, or really any vegetables, should be washed prior to cutting. This would prevent cross-contamination from any contaminants that end up on your cutting board. It's also important for ready-to-eat foods, such as salads, where they're not going to be cooked, and any potential for contaminants be removed prior to cutting. Here the preparer is taking a Japanese cleaver, a Chinese cleaver, and drawing the blade across the cutting board to clean the cutting board off. This practice of drawing that blade across the cutting board will dull the blade. And when cutting, you want the sharpest knife possible to prevent any injury. And even though that sounds counterintuitive, a dull knife is more likely to slip and cause a cut, whereas a sharp knife generally will not slip while cutting. Here the same process that was used for the first half of the cucumber is being used for the second half, where it is being cut in half lengthwise, the flat sides being put down on the cutting board, and a 45 degree angle cut is being made as the cucumber is being sliced. Prior to cutting the cucumber in pieces, the preparer cuts the cucumber lengthwise. And what this gives you is two flat surfaces that you can place on the cutting board, two flat surfaces of the cucumber. And the other thing that this does is prevents a round vegetable or fruit from rolling while cutting, and the potential for rolling can end up yielding a cut. The knife can easily slip if the vegetable rolls. So in this case, he's taking the two flat sides, putting them down on the cutting board, and making his cuts. The preparer has a small bag available near the work area to put any food scraps in. This is a great idea as you don't want your work area to be cluttered with a lot of food scraps and other waste from the cooking process. It does not have to be a bag. It can be a bowl or any other type of small container. This way you collect everything and at the end of the cooking process you can dump out.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Here we have the climber one move in on this boulder. They are actually putting their right foot on the left start hold. Right hand is still on the start hold and then left hand is in this Waco crimp. Already I really like this method. A lot of climbers keep their feet low and then try and match this hold, but here we have the climber skipping a lot of that tedious aspect of this boulder and just plopping their foot right up on this good crimp and laying everything back into this shoulder off of this left hand hold. And then after getting this left hand out, uh, to, uh, this decent hold here, the climber starts to think about, uh, maybe I should put a heel hook where my hand is, maybe I should do something with my feet and ultimately just kind of decided to campus through. So they went right hand and then quick left hand into this jug pinch. And I really liked this level of decision-making from the climber. Um, they knew that if all else fails, you can probably campus through it. And instead of attempting something that feels, um, insecure, the climber just goes ahead and campuses through. They did a good job at reading the boulder, knowing that both of these hands were on and that they were really good. So you don't always have to do the perfect beta to have the most efficient beta.

Get this guide hand on the ball as you take it up for your release. He's got beautiful spacing here and angle to use the glass. Again, just kind of flings it up there. I think he's going to have more success if he would just approach this with more aggression, really lift those hips, really push off, push off, power comes from your legs. Here he kind of shoots over that left shoulder, you know, kind of like, you know, a bit more, I would probably square this, my left shoulder up a little bit better. But here you see like very little lift, very little explosiveness on, on as he goes up. But the ball is in the right place to go through the net. He's aiming for the top of that square. That looks really good. Just little teeny steps. I would just lengthen my stride here as I go from side to side. Just have a kind of have an intention and purpose to really cover space as you go. But let's keep this ball up high. Again, those little guards are going to take that away. Here he gets the ball out of the net, moves to the right side. Again, he steps through with his left foot, which is the correct foot. He's got two hands on the ball as he prepares to shoot the right-hand layup. Here you see he's in a pretty good space here. He's not too far under the basket. He's got a really good view of the backboard. Again, he just moves from the right side to the left side. He steps through on that right foot, which is correct. The left leg follows. I love that he's got two hands on the ball. His eyes and head are up.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

However, she appears quite distracted or unconfident in her movement abilities, particularly as she continues to look over her left shoulder, which appears to be kind of off-screen here. She demonstrates that she has an understanding of the movement vocabulary through the soft bend in her knees and the appropriate amount of grounding through her knees and pelvis, which is really helping her to stay connected to the rhythm. She also incorporates some nice range of motion in her pelvis up through her upper body, through her shoulders and her head as well, and incorporates her arms choreographically in a way that's clear, precise, and appropriate.

And there he regulates the heat and does the stir. Were he to have left it alone, it could bubble over and make a tremendous mess on the stove. He's stirring again as he's gone up. The bubbles have risen and now he's stirring them down. You can hear an increasingly loud sizzle. You'll see little bubbles form around the edges of this. And that means that it's about to boil up, which means that it's got increased activity into the liquid and it's going to bubble up. When boiling milk, moving it around frequently is important because it can easily burn to the bottom of the pan or scald is what that's called. He's adding sugar to the milk in the saucepan. He's pouring the milk into his saucepan. and now you can see they've all subsided and they're low again. Here he's put his spoon into his cup. This is probably a great idea for making sure that it doesn't drip or get any residue on his countertop or stove. But it also probably is carrying a little bit of those loose tea leaves and might leave those in the cup. So probably putting down maybe a napkin or something on the countertop to rest the spoon would be a better choice. He's starting to stir the tea and as you can hear a little bit of a crunchy sizzle sound, it's very faint but that is an indicator that the pan is getting hot and as he moves that milk around the pan it hits the sides where it wasn't before and that creates that little sizzle saying the pan is heating up. Now he's regulating the heat up and rising the bubbles. Now he's had to remove that spoon and put it on the stove, indicating that probably the stove was a better choice. One thing he is doing is stirring his mixture with a metal spoon. He's very comfortable with this action. If you're new to stirring hot liquids and things in general in pots, metal spoons do conduct heat very easily and that could easily heat up the spoon and cause a problem on the handle end. So be careful. Sometimes you just wanna choose a spoon that has maybe a wooden handle or something that has a plastic handle if you're using hot liquids. and then he reduces the heat again to bring the bubbles down. He's turned off his heat. He's gotten the handle for his saucepan in his left hand and in his right hand he's retrieved a spoon. He's continuing to stir his mixture, regulating his heat up and down. He's straining his tea milk mixture through the strainer into his cup. He's retrieving a fine mesh strainer that's very small with a diameter about the same size as his cup. He's grabbing a saucepan from the shelf. Stirring the mixture when the bubble up becomes apparent is a good way to get it to release the liquid in those bubbles and allow it to calm down. Another way is to regulate the heat or to remove it from the heat. making sure to get it, you can hear it contact the bottom, the spoon is making contact with the bottom of his pan to make sure that nothing is sticking on the bottom and he's making sure that everything's moving around. That releases a lot of the tea oils into the tea, into the milk, and also allows for the sugar to dissolve. He rises it again and the bubbles as you can see here are right towards the top. Right as they're going to possibly bubble over. He's adding loose tea to the saucepan with the sugar and milk. This looks to be a dark tea. It can be one of many varieties. Milk tea is often made with black tea. Loose tea is one option. If you have bagged tea, you can also use that. Here he's regulating his heat up, increasing the heat, then you can see the bubbles begin to rise again. And here you can see why he uses that strainer. All of this black granular stuff is what he's making sure does not get into his cup. He's had it express all of its flavor, and now he's able to use that fine mesh strainer to keep it in out of his mixture so he's not drinking it. He's lighting his stove with a special lighting device. He has a propane stove. Now he's regulating it down and the bubbles will fall.

You can see he's in the general ballpark for it, but he just loses attention. So I think it's kind of starting too slow. So by the time he goes there, he's already so powered down that he's not able to move fast and fluid and keep the tension. By the time he gets there, he's already falling so far back from the wall.

Student showed an excellent cross under for the upscale. Playing of these octaves looks really good. You can see that there's more emphasis on the pinky side of the hand here with this concaveness. I would see if they could bring this hand to the center, bring the weight of the hand centered a little bit more, and you can see how it's affecting the wrist angle here. If they were to bring this hand weight over this direction a bit more, this wrist might go this way and fix itself. Might cause pain over long periods of practicing, but this might be necessary for them to reach this octave. You can see they're barely getting that pinky and knowing spot. This hand frame for octaves actually looks really good. Due to the size of her hands, she needs to adjust a further back hand position to achieve the full spread. This is acceptable for a student of this age. You can see here, bending of the fingers at the knuckles in a concave way. They need to be convex in order to play stronger on the keys. Student opts to use a fourth finger instead of the third finger to reach for the E note here. The finger pattern should have a third finger here instead. This is because she's about to play a ring finger in the left hand. Practicing is required here to isolate that moment. Another great example of an ascended left-hand switchover, which is a crossover instead. When the student crosses over, they end up playing both of these keys at the same time.

I think they could also create more of a pendulum in their hips if they were to ground their body. The dancer has a really lovely engagement from their torso to the extremities, so really kudos to them for this awesome work in their salsa. The dancer performs a lot of complicated movement here, so I would encourage them to be very precise about not only the direction that they're looking, but also the footwork and having strength and power throughout their arms. Through this whole section, I would reiterate my earlier point about making sure that they're grounded so they can have even further hip articulation. So even from the beginning, as they begin to lift their arms like a bird, really having power as they lift those arms up starts the dance off even with a dramatic flair and an attention to detail that is important for a salsa. nice power throughout their arms, I would encourage them to take their look with their arm and guide their head around in kind of this circular motion that they're doing their arm to create a nice fluidity of movement. Again, this is another moment, even though there's transitioning and there's not a lot of choreography happening, making sure to stay engaged and stay with it and have that same attack and energy really creates an elevated, dynamic quality within the salsa. It feels like the dancer kind of forgot the steps. So even if they mess up, it's important to just keep going and keep dancing. The audience doesn't know what you're supposed to do.

He does a really nice job getting those legs twisted so because he kind of over twists he's able to get his body fully around and back to the front without compromising the direction. So here, nice roll to the back, bend those knees a little bit more, and then maybe try to move from the back a bit more, but really nice arm movement, and the eyes are pointing to the front. So here I noticed just in a really small thing that he did when he did the step over just now he kind of lifts he lifts up really highly on his toe on his right foot to cross into the next step and I think that just kind of added another level of energy and another level of just really great technique from this dancer because he just has a really great energy of his movement and again able to throw his body but still remaining controlled so this was just a really different and just elevated way of doing this step So here's where I first noticed how much she kind of throws his body into the movement for this crossover with his right leg, his arms are kind of throwing and it may look, it may want to be a bit all over the place but he does a really good job at just controlling the steps even though he's clearly throwing his body into this movement. So really nice job just understanding his energy level and body and how to still keep it controlled. So again, really nice job getting that leg, whipping it around and then getting into this position. His leg is here on the floor. He does a really nice job twisting his left heel out from the hip and then the arms are up, eyes are facing to the front. So overall, really nice job up to here. And here I just noticed when he jumps out, he kind of shakes his head a little bit. So again, really just nice way of playing off the music. His legs are spread open nice and wide, knees are slightly bent, and then the arms are swinging back and forth as he jumped out. If I had one note, I would just say this kind of section, I notice this head is down to the floor. So I want to keep those eyes up and lifted so that way your attention isn't down to the floor. So the dancer, even though this isn't the main choreography, the dancer does a really nice job just doing a bit of improv in the beginning to get the his I guess body moving and to get the groove of the music but just in this step in particular he's doing kind of a square around and does a really nice job getting the using up the full space and moving his shoulders and is really getting into the steps. So I think this is a really great example, especially for a male dancer, because they do dance a little bit differently than the women, so not as much like fluidity in the body, but definitely giving a really great energy and just really great movement and control in his movement with his level of energy that he's giving. And out of that really nice clean sharp turn to get into this next movement his body is facing square to the front And just really get energy overall So here I noticed he did something a little different. He rolled from the bottom up, which was still really nice because he stayed with the music. So really nice just personal change, I think, into this role instead of rolling from the top down. So from the beginning, stepping out, really nice twist going forward into this next step.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Good example of playing differently, but knowing that it's supposed to sound together. They're matching energies here really well. This thumb tends to be peaking up a little bit too much as well. This musician has an amazing elbow use when getting up to that higher register on a lower string. Elbow should absolutely be up like that. That looks really good. Really excellent ricochet bow stroke here. Uh, Vila was rushing here at the end while the violin was slowing down. These musicians do a good job of being just slightly different with the articulation between them as to still be heard separately without getting lost in the mix between the two. The bow articulation with this section was particularly enjoyable. They're obviously fresh looking at this. Even though this musician here isn't getting all of the notes, he's really good at flubbing it until he can get to the next downbeat. Sign of a good musician who's good at sight reading. Really good following ensemble here These musicians tend just to play fast because they're young. As soon as they slow down, textures, phrasing, even their ensemble drastically increases. They just suffer from too fast of an internal pulse. installation here. I really like the sound and control of the energy here that I'm hearing. Great musicians already off to a good start with their postures, nice and tall spines for both of them, good flexibility in their side-to-side motions. This musician tends to be more up and down this way. Shoulder rest situation for the violas might be a good change. Beal's doing a really good job staying consistent throughout this whole section. I feel like they could follow the phrasing of the violin just a little bit better in order to make the phrasing more cohesive between the two of them. No sense of real tempo in this section other than that it was fast. I love how gentle the very top high pitches are in both instruments and how delicate they sound in the bow. Great intonation with the octaves here in this musician. Good phrasing in the bow and bow control with the feel. Intonation in the violin here again. This musician's thumb is on the top of the bow, which looks really good. And the first finger is curved beautifully over the stick. This is good technique and form on the bow.

You can see the player is really opening up his hips very wide, the toe not quite pointing up and also obviously the lower leg coming inside based on the proximity of the ball to the non-kicking foot. So by opening up our hips a little bit more is obviously going to lead to the ball starting more out to the right side. Again, we can see the position of the body with the ball, the hips behind the line of the ball, the back again is leaning back and away. So we need to really concentrate on stepping into the ball, getting our hips further forward in line with the ball. Can we get our chest leaning forwards through the strike as opposed to leaning back on contact? We can see the players' preparation and approach. So, a player coming at the ball from the slight angle behind the ball. We can see from the non-kicking foot, pointing more towards the right side of the goal, hip position, chest position, or pretty much facing towards the right of the goal. Coming at our non-kicking foot in a position where we are level with the front of the ball, with the toe or slightly in front. Decent distance here between the ball and the foot, and maybe a touch slightly further forward to help with the body and the control. What you can see as the player is in this motion here is that the left knee is already starting to bend, which is going to potentially lead to hitting the bottom half of the ball, and the body is already starting to lean back and away. So, as we're striking through the ball, we're going to end up potentially reaching a little bit more, which is going to lead to potential less control and ability to generate power. Play again, very short run up, approaching the ball from a decent position, non-kicking foot, we look to see which way it's pointing, can give us a general direction of where the player is aiming for, also can help our hips, our follow-through action, also can have an effect on the foot surface selection that the player is using to make the shot. For me, I want to try and get the toe level with the front of the ball, get a little bit more distance between the front and the non-kicking foot to allow for the freedom of the back lift and follow-through to come through. But in general, the player is not in a too bad of a position, starting to utilise his upper body a little bit more, he sees his left arm up and away, which opens up his chest and his hips, which will maximise the back lift and follow-through, generate a little bit more power through the momentum of the body. So looking at the contact with the ball, so we can see the player turning out his hips, his knee, making contact with the inside of the foot. Again, it's hard to fully tell, but it looks like we're hitting middle to low part of the ball, which is going to control the trajectory of the ball, whether it's on the ground or whether it goes up in the air. We can again see as the player is making contact, the body is leaning back and away from the direction that the intended ball is going to go. So we want to try and make sure that we get the non-kicking foot in place so we can bend this left knee forward, get our hips closer to the line of the ball, get our chest leaning slightly further forward and get our head in a steady, stable position over the ball to really maximise the quality and control over the pass-stroke shot. Just looking at the follow-through action, so it looks like the player really opened up his foot surface to make contact with the left side of the ball, which is leading to the potential direction of the ball going outside the post. You can see that the leg is now quickly turning a little bit to the left, having quite got ourselves in that locked position through the middle of the ball, so potentially opened up our hips a little bit too far. You can see the body position, the hip position, again is pointing towards that right side, maybe slightly out, which is where the ball has started to go out. Based on the contact point between the ball and the foot being towards the left, it's going to continue to lead the ball to the right-hand side. Again, we can see the body is leaning back and away. That just increases the chance for the ball to be travelling upwards because we're not stepping in and getting through the line of the ball with our body. And just looking at the follow-through action, so the foot does change slightly from being out and to bending slightly in. That's more the angle of the leg. So we want to make sure we keep this foot in a locked position, bring our straight leg through in the general direction we want the ball to go. You can see the follow-through action is pretty good in terms of moving through at least 45 degrees to 90 degrees from his body out in front of him. So that helps with the control and power, striking all the way through the ball is important for that. Again, I like the left knee bending forward, bringing the body forward towards the direction the ball is going to go. Again because we're just still slightly behind the ball with a non-kicking foot, just leads our body to be leaning slightly away from that direction so we don't get the full impact of utilizing our upper body to also help with control and power. And just looking at the impact, so player more utilising the instep, so turning his foot but using the space between the laces and the inside of the foot, so it's a slightly harder part of the foot, but we are obviously trying to maximise our contact with the ball. We can see that the player, again because for me he's bending his knee on contact with the ground on preparation and then bending the knee further, that's impacting the player's ability to really strike through the ball, through the middle of the ball as opposed to constantly hitting the underside of the ball or the lower half of the ball, which is going to change the trajectory of it. And we can also see from the preparation step that our body is now still leaning back, we want to try and bring this left knee, obviously bending forward like it is, but to get the hips closer to the line of the ball, get the chest slightly leaning forward and the head in a more stable position directly over the ball so our body momentum is moving through the strike in the direction we want it to go. Again, players approach, very short, one step, coming at a slight angle, obviously the toe pointing towards the left of the goal, so based on the players, a little visual check before he steps into the ball, stepping into the ball, looks like we're aiming more towards the left side of the goal, so we want to get the non-kicking foot level with the front of the ball, there's a good distance here between the ball and the non-kicking foot, so as long as the player is going to be bringing the ball to the left side of the goal as we're looking at it, then the foot's not in a bad position. Again, we can see the players knee, again I want it slightly straighter so we're not too low as this back lift comes through the ball, generally we'll hit the lower half of the ball, we like the player to stay as high as possible, straight leg through to this left shoulder, really utilise this left arm up and away from his body to open up his chest, his hips, maximise his back lift and then as his back lift comes through, start to bend that knee forward so we get our body momentum moving towards the direction of the shot, but I like the general body position, hips and chest starting to face where we want to go which can help with our follow through action and power. Player utilizing the inside of the foot, looks from this position that the toe is maybe pointing down a little bit, so it doesn't necessarily mean that we have our ankle in that fully locked position to really maximize the control and power on the shot. Also looks like we're hitting the ball again slightly lower, which is going to raise the ball up. We can also see our bodies leaning back and away. We still want to try and make sure on contact we're hitting the ball as close to this vertical line as we can, with our hips and our chest moving slightly forward, head in a steady stable position over the ball to make sure that we maintain full balance and control over our body. So as we're making contact with the ball to go forward, our body's moving forward with it. And it's looking at the angle of approach. Again, it's becoming clear where the player is aiming to go based on his varied angle of approaches and how he's stepping and preparing with the non-kicking foot. So the previous one, he came square and then got his body in a position which was facing to go to the left. Here you can see from his position of his hips, his body, his angle of approach and where the non-kicking foot is planted that the player is now intending to go to the opposite corner that he did in the previous shot. So that's important information and good information to know for the player. We can still see the non-kicking foot. We wanna be alongside the ball with the toes closer to the front edge of the ball, if not slightly in front. That just helps bring our body through the line of the shot and give ourselves that little extra distance between the ball and the non-kicking foot to allow the freedom and momentum of that right leg coming through the ball. Body looks in a decent position. Again, I like to see players get their body open. So this arm, if we're stepping in with the left foot to get the left arm up and away from the body to really open up the hips, open up the chest and maximize the backswing and follow for action from the player. Again, just looking at the follow-through action, so the player maintains a relatively locked position in his foot. It does look like the ball comes a little off the heel of the foot as opposed to right through the middle of the ball, which is going to affect the player's ability to fully control the direction of the pass. We can see our follow-through straight leg through that foot, which may be coming a little bit to the right and the ball is coming away a little bit to the left. So the contact point between the foot and the ball is important to really maximise that control and accuracy. I do like, again, the player bending his left knee forward, bringing his body forward over that standing leg. So with his follow-through action and the balance that he has, we're getting our body now facing and aligned the direction we want to go. So we want our hips facing the way the ball is going, chest facing the way the ball is going so we can maximise our control, accuracy and power. And just looking at the contact, so the player choosing the inside of the foot to make contact, you can see how low the foot is to the ground. So we're making contact with the lower half of the ball, which is naturally going to bring the ball up higher on a higher trajectory. We also want to make sure that as we're striking the ball here, you can see the player bending his knee, the leg is in a vertical position from the body, which is good. But we can see because of the ball being slightly in front of the body on contact, our body is leaning back, which is going to make it more difficult to get the ball down or strike through with body momentum and power. I like that the player is making visual contact on the ball on contact. This maximizes the part of the ball we're going to strike through, which helps with the quality and control of the shot. So looking at the follow through action, so we can see the player maintains good solid position with his foot, toe pointing out, ankle locked, relatively straight leg coming through the ball and through the line of the intended direction of the shot which helps with the control as well as the power. Also like you can see the player as he's following through, bending his left knee, standing leg which helps get the body moving forwards and through in the same direction that we want the ball to go, so it's important to maintain our balance and control of our body all the way through the strike. Heel Seed player maintains a relatively locked position with the foot. The foot does wobble a little bit on the immediate follow through where the ball hits a little closer to the heel but the follow through action in general is pretty good. Locked position coming immediately through the direction that we want the ball to go. You can see the hip position generally facing the direction the ball wants to go. Chest facing the direction we want to go and the follow through action is really coming all the way through the ball, close to a 90 degree position in front of the body. So that helps bring our body forward and our hips obviously aligned with the non-kicking foot helps us with our control of the shot. So looking at the preparation again, player utilising the right foot, kind of a half step coming very straight onto the ball. Although you can see from the player's body position it looks like the player is aiming towards the left side. You can see from the position of the hips and the body, so he's stepping in straight but if he's coming to the left then obviously that will change the angle slightly. We can see the non-kicking foot is really close to the ball which is going to impact the freedom for the right leg to come through cleanly to strike the ball. So we want this left foot to be alongside the ball with a little bit of distance between the ball and the foot, maybe three quarters of a ball to a full ball's width. Toe level with the front of the ball, especially so if we're pointing in the direction that we want to go. So this foot here needs to be slightly further forward and out from the ball to set ourselves up for success. Play again utilising the inside of the right foot for the shot. So here I like the position the player is obviously making contact with as he's backswing is coming through he's starting to bend his left knee to come forward. It's bringing his hips closer as you see to the line of the ball. So we're going to have more balance, more control with our body as we go through the strike which can help with some quality, control, accuracy and power. We can see the position of the foot, we want to lock our ankle when using the inside of the foot, get our heel pointing slightly down, toe up so we can strike with a firm contact through the point of the ball. Again looks like it's a little below centre of the ball which is going to change the trajectory of the ball, potentially make it come up. And again because the foot was slightly behind the front of the ball our body is leaning back slightly but in a better position than the previous two shots. Also like the player's visual, you can see he's looking down at the ball so before he's making the shot we want him to look up but then as he goes into the motion of stepping in and shooting the ball or passing the ball we want his head to come down, stay steady and still really focus on that part of the ball he wants to make contact with. Again we can see the follow through action in the general direction that the ball is travelling. The foot position stays relatively locked but does go from being out and then turns inside as the player I think is trying to correct and potentially get the ball to travel back inside by spinning the ball a little bit and hitting the outside of the ball. Again we can see the body position is slightly moving forward with the standing leg but still continues to be a little bit off balance away and to the right the direction the ball is travelling. With the follow through action again decent follow through going forwards through to this 90 degree angle in front of the body so that just helps with elements of the power and control. Here the ball is just going a little bit wider based on the contact point between the ball and the foot as well as the general direction that the body was facing in preparation. Again, I like the follow-through action of the player. Keeps his foot in a locked position, straight leg, generally coming through in the direction he wants the ball to go. We can see the non-kicking foot, the follow-through, the hip position, everything's effectively aligned to go in the same direction that the ball is going, which helps with our control. The only thing, obviously, from here is the player is still leaning back as he's making contact. We can try and get this body moving forward through the strike, get that body closer to in line with that non-kicking foot and moving forward in the direction that the ball is travelling. Here just looking at the follow through action, so the player here is kind of cutting across the ball from right to left. So obviously his body position is aiming for the ball to go to here, but the contact point with the ball and the direction of the foot coming across the ball is obviously changing the direction of the ball. You can see the player's follow through, I like in the player's follow through that he keeps his foot in a very locked position and he's not stuck in the ground with the left foot so his footwork and his mobility is good. But he's trying a different technique than just trying to strike the ball straight towards the left of the goal, he's cutting across the ball to get some form of out swing or spin on the ball. So his follow through action here is obviously twisting his body around, so it's just a slightly more advanced technique that the player is looking to utilise. Player's approach again coming from a slight angle to the left, although again we can see the non-kicking foot pointing towards the right, the body position, the hips, the chest, everything's aligned to the right. So that means that approach is maybe slightly square and straight behind the ball, so it just limits the player's ability to open up his hips if we're going in that direction, so maybe from a slightly greater angle will help him in terms of getting that body movement through the ball. Non-kicking foot again, can we get it in a position slightly further forward in line with the front of the ball, so we create this number 10 shape, so we can move forwards through it rather than leaning back and away. Play again, short one-step approach from a slight angle. Again, we can see the intended outcome for the player from the position of the non-kicking foot pointing more towards the left side of the goal. We can also see obviously from the position of the hips and the chest that the intended target is to come towards the left. So that's going to impact where our non-kicking foot goes. So here, because he's going to the left, we can see the toe level with the front of the ball, so in a much better position. Good distance between the ball and the non-kicking foot, it's probably about three quarters of a ball's width away, which is good. And we can see, I personally would like the player to step in with a straight leg up through the shoulder, left arm up and away, really open up the chest and the hips to get this back lift as big as we can so we can really strike through the ball freely and with clean, accurate power. Again, executing good follow through in terms of keeping that foot in the locked position. Follow through action comes all the way through the line of the ball up to that effectively 90 degree position from his body. Leg coming through straight position in the general direction the ball is going helps control the direction as well as additional power. Coming to the left knee slightly bending but the body is still leaning slightly away so we're not fully utilising our upper body to move through the line of the shot adding extra quality and control. Just looking at the follow through action, player maintains good shape with the foot in a locked position. You can see here he's kind of twisting a little bit, doesn't kind of come through with a straight leg, still slightly bent so I want to try and come through straight leg, but the player is coming through the direction of the ball which is good. Again I like that the player is bending his left knee, helps with the body but you can still see the body is leaning back and away which means that we don't necessarily have full balance and control over our body to move into the direction with the ball which will help us with more control and power. We want our body to be facing, hips facing, chest facing, everything facing the direction we want the ball to go. So here player on approach coming from a slight angle, again one step approach to the ball which is fine. You can see the non-kicking foot planted pointing towards the left side. Again we ideally want this non-kicking foot to be alongside the ball slightly in front. So foot's not in a too bad of a position based on the players body position really shaping to come more to the left hand side. See from the body position of the hips and the body so that gives us an indication of potentially where the player is aiming for and giving us space to really rotate through the ball. I like the players body position here from the left foot up to the left shoulder. If anything maybe a slightly straighter leg on landing. If he's bending his knee too soon probably going to get underneath the ball in the follow through. So having that straighter leg and staying a little taller will help us really come through the ball with a cleaner contact through the middle of the ball. But utilising his left arm up and away from his body, right arm down to counterbalance that really opens up his hips and his body which is going to help in terms of maximising this back lift and follow through to generate more power in the shot. Player again, short approach, little half, kind of half to one step approach from a slight angle. Here you can see the foot a little closer to being alongside the ball, still maybe slightly further back, want that toe to be level with the front of the ball if possible. Distance between the foot and the ball, maybe a little closer, a little further away, three quarter balls width will allow us a little bit more flexibility and freedom to open up our hips and strike through the ball, especially if using the inside of the foot. We also want to look at the direction that the non-kicking foot is pointing, that is going to help us control our follow through action and our final body position and keeping balance as we strike through the ball. Again, the player here is a little upright, we can see from the left leg up to the shoulder, not really utilising the arms for additional balance so that's going to restrict the player's ability to really get his body momentum moving through the line of the shot. Again, player's short approach, kind of one step in from a slight angle. Again we can see there's a definite variation in the player's body position in terms of going right to the left-hand side of the goal. So we can see the non-kicking foot pointing to the left, body shape, hips, chest starting to turn and shape towards the left. So that's going to help in terms of the intended outcome and accuracy of the strike. Again we can see the non-kicking foot is still slightly close to the ball. It's going to restrict a little bit of our movement through the ball. We want this foot to be a little bit further away from the ball, three-quarters width to a full ball's width away to allow us that full rotation through the ball. Get the toe level with the front of the ball and pointing in the general direction we want the ball to go. Obviously the more straight this foot is, it's going to restrict a little bit of the follow-through action and the final body position of the hips. I like here that the player is, although I like a straighter leg as he lands, you can see the player now is utilising his left arm up and away from his body which now opens up his chest and his hips which will help with the back lift and the follow-through motion. I also like his head position here. You can see his body is moving much closer to the line of the ball, not leaning too far back which is going to help him in terms of getting his body momentum through the strike. Players approach again, very short, kind of square behind the ball. You're going to have a non-kicking foot generally, we want alongside the ball, toe level with the front of the ball, decent space between the ball and the non-kicking foot. So the foot here a little close is going to impact the freedom and flexibility for the right leg to come through the ball. You can see that the left knee is already starting to bend forward, but the player's body, for me, is in a better position, not leaning too far back away from the ball. So that's going to help him in terms of moving his body through the line of the shot, utilising his left arm up and away for balance and preparing, obviously, the foot in the backlift action. trying to look at the contact point with the ball so we can see the player again bending his left knee a little early so he's really getting to hit the ball on the lower part of the lower half of the ball. We can see the player is pointing his toe down so looking to utilize his laces to strike through the ball. Here it's slightly after the ball so the foot is coming across the line of the ball and you can see the ball is starting to move off through the centre so just based on the player's action of cutting across the ball coming from right to left he's going to have a change of outcome on the direction of the ball regardless of the body position so that contact between the foot and the ball is important. You can see the body is in a better position than some of the prior ones he's not leaning too far back he's continuing to move his body forwards in the general direction he wants the ball to go keeping his head focused on the ball the contact point using his arms for additional balance and control. As we're looking at the contact point with the ball slightly after, so it looks like the player's utilising the inside of the foot. You can see the position of the foot and the part of the ball he's making contact with is outside of the right line of the post. We can see obviously the non-kicking foot is still pointing in that direction. Hips and chest pointing in the direction they were intending to go. Here you can see the body, the hips still leaning really far back and away from the direction he wants to go, which is going to increase the risk of the ball going higher and lacking potential control and power. So just looking at the approach and preparation for the strike. Player stepping to the ball from a slight angle which is good. We want to step alongside the ball with the toe pointing in the general direction we would want the ball to go. Ideally we would want the toe level with the front edge of the ball, slightly in front so we can get our body moving through the line of the shot and leave about three quarters to a full ball's width between the ball and the non-kicking foot to allow for the freedom to strike through. So here you can see the toe is behind the line of the ball so we're just going to end up reaching for the ball and not be able to get our body moving through the shot in a forward direction as much as we would ideally like. Player again utilising the inside of the right foot. So you can see because of the proximity between the ball and the non-kicking foot being a little too close. As the player is opening up his hips, turning his knee out to use the right foot, we can see that the heel is pointing slightly up and the toe down. So he may have a locked ankle, but it's gonna affect the contact point on the ball when the toe is down. That's gonna hit much more kind of middle to low part of the ball. And there's more risk of the ball also making contact closer to the heel. And you can see the right leg is bending inside as opposed to just coming straight down to the ground. So the placement of the non-kicking foot in preparation is very important for the contact on the ball. We can also see the player's body position on contact. Again, he's leaning back and away from the intended direction of the pass, stroke shot. So that leads to additional risk of us bringing the ball up and high. And it also restricts the power that we can get from our body momentum moving through the strike. Again, I do like that the player maintains visual contact. You can see from his head position that he's looking at the contact point on the ball, which is gonna help him with his control and accuracy. Player's follow through technique again pretty solid. We can see player maintains a good lock position with the foot so that firm contact with the ball helps with both control and power. You can see the straight leg coming through the ball and that follow through action is coming all the way up around 90 degrees from the waist. So it's really maximising the follow through action in terms of the power we can generate and the additional control to go forwards and through in the line that we want the ball to go. Again we can see the left leg bending forward that helps bring the body forward and maintain our balance so the body is leaning back a little bit. But in general the player is in good control of his body which is going to help with the control and power of the shot. Again, using the in-step area, the space between the inside and the laces, so it's a harder part of the surface but we still get a good amount of contact between the ball and the foot. Again, we can see we're hitting right side to lower half of the ball, which is going to both control the direction and also the trajectory. If we're going to hit the lower half of the ball, the ball is going to naturally want to go higher up the ground. We can again see from the contact point with the ball, no kicking foot. Now, the body is again leaning backwards and away from the direction that we intend the ball to go. We just run the risk of the ball travelling up higher because we're reaching for the balls, so we're not going to have as clean a contact with it and the ball is going to run the risk of going higher up into the air from this direction. We don't have full control of our body. We want our body to be moving forwards with the contact point on the ball. We see here player using the inside of the right foot. So again, we can see the position of the foot, heel up, toe down. So it's gonna impact the part of the ball that we make contact with. If we're gonna use the inside of the foot, ideally for me, we're gonna see the knee bent and the leg going straight down. So we can get our heel down, toe up, ideally through the middle of the ball to maximize the contact point between the ball and the foot to maximize our control and power. Here, because the ball, again, looks a little too close to the non-kicking foot, as well as the approach being straight. And if he comes at an angle, he probably opens himself up a little bit more, but coming straight, we're now bending our right leg inside, which is now pulling our foot, regardless of maybe locking our ankle in a position where we're maybe hitting more of the lower half of the ball and to the right of the ball with the inside of the foot and getting more contact closer to the heel of the right foot, which is gonna have an impact on the quality of the strike itself. And just once again, the player's body position, you can see is leaning backwards and away on contact. So I want the chest leaning slightly further forward, the head in a position closer to the line of the ball. So we can really get our body moving through the strike. Again, just looking at the follow-through action, player maintains good solid position with his right foot, getting his straight leg through the ball in the general direction he wants the ball to go, which is good for control and power. Also like again, the player bending his left knee forwards and through, which brings the body upright and forwards in the direction that the ball wants to go, which is important for balance and control. And then what we want to see is the hips, the chest, the body aligned, all facing and moving forward in the same direction that the ball is going to control the quality and control of the shot. Here you see the player more utilising the instep as opposed to the inside, so the instep between the laces and the inside of the foot. We can see that's going to change the impact point with the ball. We can also see from the contact how close the non-kicking foot and the ball are together. It looks like we're hitting the underneath of the ball, which again is going to, if we're at the lower half of the ball, it's going to lead to the ball naturally rising off the ground and in the air. Here with the other body, I thought he was in a better position on his preparation. As he's making contact now, you can see the body is leaning back and away, so the player is losing aspects of his balance. As we come and strike through the ball, we want this left knee to bend to come forward and to keep the body, the hips, the chest leaning forward and coming through the line of the strike as much as we can, so we get maximum body momentum through. This is just down to the non-kicking foot and the preparation for the strike. Player again utilising more the insteps, not quite the inside, not quite the laces, the harder part of the top of the foot. We can see the contact point with the ball is probably on the lower half which is going to raise the ball up. Body position is ok, still slightly leaning back but generally the player is in line with the ball. The only thing I'd say here is based on the selection of the surface of the foot he's trying to use and the proximity between the ball and the non-kicking foot, he's obviously becoming a little bit more upright which is going to be harder to maintain his balance and get his body momentum moving forwards and through the line of the shot. And so we'll get the player's preparation and approach. So short approach, slight angle, one step towards the ball. Again, ideally we want to see the player's non-kicking foot plant alongside the ball, create this number 10 shape between the ball and the non-kicking foot, get the toe level with the front of the ball slightly further in front. That means we can make contact with the ball and get our body moving through the line of the shot. If our foot's behind the line of the ball, we're going to end up reaching for the ball a little bit and our body's going to be naturally leaning back as we make contact with the ball. So we want to get this foot further forward. Distance between the non-kicking foot and the ball, three quarters to a full ball's width is ideal. So, but the distance is okay, it's just behind the line of the ball. We also want to try and land, if we can, with a straight leg up to the shoulder, use this left arm up and away from the body to really open up our hips and our body. And the straight leg just allows us to have a little bit more flexibility as then we bend our knee towards the ball as the backswing comes through the line of the shot. Player again switching his approach and body position so now clear again that the player is now aiming for the right side. You can see that from the players hip position, chest position, non-kicking foot pointing clearly in that direction. So there's an intended outcome for the player in terms of where he wants the shot to go. So again the approach, can we come at the ball at a slight angle so if he's going to be shooting the ball towards the right, like the ball, player to come maybe on a slightly greater angle to step in and get his body rotating through the ball. Here he's coming at the ball maybe slightly too straight depending on where the player is going. Non-kicking foot again, we want to be alongside the ball, toe level with the front of the ball, create this number 10 shape and get enough distance between the ball and the non-kicking foot so we can freely move through the ball. You can see the leg position of the right, it's a little shallow in its back lift and very straight to the ball. High hips here so we want straight leg stepping further forward, really getting up to that left shoulder, left arm up and out, coming at an angle so we can really open up our body and get our momentum moving through the strike. And follow through action is solid, so the player generally keeps his foot in a decently locked position, relatively straight leg coming through the direction and line of the shot for added control and power. The power again can be helped by this follow through action coming to this 90 degree position from his body. Again the biggest problem consistently is the player as he's making this contact, his body is always leaning back and away so we're not getting the full maximum effect of utilising our upper body and body momentum to come through the line of the shot, getting our hips, our chest and everything moving forward. So looking at the contact points, we see the player utilising the inside of the foot. We can see again because of the position of the non-kicking foot on preparation, we're reaching slightly in front of our body to make contact with the ball, which leads us to contacting the ball on our way up on that follow-through action. Also looks like we're making contact with the lower half of the ball, which is going to naturally bring the ball on a higher trajectory and up. You can also see because of the non-kicking foot, the body is leaning back and away from the direction that we intend the ball to go, which again is going to lead to a little element of lack of control and power potentially. We want to try and get our body moving forwards and through the line of the pass-stroke shot. follow through action again we see the player maintaining a relatively locked foot position she's going to lead to a firmer contact with the ball follow through is in the general direction the ball is going through the middle of the goal which is in line with the non kicking foot the hip position and the follow-through action you can see is pretty prominent through to that close to 90 degree angle in front of his body so he's really maximizing the contact and the follow-through action for control and power the body you can see is still struggling to move fully forward through the line of the ball so obviously we're planted through this left leg can we get our body moving forwards in the line of the shot to maximize the potential power control and accuracy as opposed to leaning back and away", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And be able to power up and get a little bit higher and be a little bit more explosive on this layout. Right here, as you can see, leaning backwards again. But one thing he's doing pretty good on this one is being in a position to be in the right place. If he was to miss the layup, he could get his offensive rebound or if he needs to get back on defense. Right here doing a good job jumping off the left foot to lay it up with the right hand. Right here, the vision is now, you want to make sure your eyes are up on the target as you're moving to see any type of oncoming traffic or be able to make any type of sudden movements as needed. The way he's leaning backwards, trying to justify seeing the backboard. If he was thought a little bit higher, he would definitely not have to do that and put himself in a better position just from a physical standpoint to be able to consistently make a layup. I think you can start up a little bit higher in a sense of getting a better angle. Right now it's being at this angle that's making it kind of tough.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

We got this good foot for the left and then a lower right foot and here the climber is kind of playing with the idea of coming in and matching this undercling. I think that this boulder might be easier if you're taller because maintaining the drive to this right foot is pretty imperative to being able to match this undercling and I think it's just a little too low for some of the climbers to feel confident in driving in this undercling. After bailing on trying to undercling, the hold just to the left of the start hold, they try the power sequence. So getting all the way up with their left hand here, and here their foot just picks as they're reaching for the hold. And yeah, it just seems like a lesser of two evils. You either try and maintain this left foot and possibly come up short on the hold, or you go past the foot and it picks and you do get enough reach, but it's hard to hold with no feet. And so I do think that this boulder is just a little bit unfair for the category.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

That way the climber does not lose pressure of the left foot placement and potential being able to get closer to the wall to make the reach. The climber right now is lowering her center of gravity due to having to perform a dynamic move next. As she is glancing over to the hold at reach, she lowers her center of gravity to stay underneath her grips by extending the arms as well as pushing over with the left foot against the hold so that she remains underneath her grips. Now when the climber is ready, she will then engage in a forceful pull up and press down mostly on the right foot to gain direction over to the hold at reach. The climber right now is chucking up and the pouch that she has attached to her is a chalk bag where she places each hand inside of the bag then later spreads them onto the palms. The chalk will help the climber to gain a better grip when sustaining the holds as well as absorbing any moisture that may be coming from her hands. The climber wasn't able to make the hand over to the edge of the hold when performing the reach. A couple things are because the climber must gain more momentum down below when coming off to the dynamic move when pressing to bring the left hand over to the hold at reach. However, we can see how her center of gravity is slightly away from the wall when performing the reach and this is because the climber's left foot has not been adjusted to go over the hold where the climber should have placed the foot slightly above to have the toe roll into the top of the hold. In this case when the climber was transferring over the weight to make the jump in the stance, we can see how the foot is still placed onto the right side and when performing the move the climber wasn't able to bring her hips close to the wall and instead is being slightly pushed away enabling her to make the reach. The climber starts until she is no longer standing on the mat. So she's in her first position, sustaining to a one-hold start, where both hands place into the same hold. This is called matching. The type of hold she's sustaining is called a jug, because the climber is able to wrap the hands around the lip of the hold. Now, the climber needs to transfer over the weight to her placement, the reason why she has brought her hips close to the wall, to transfer it over to press down by the feet. And is able to lean back onto her hand placements to transfer the weight to the grips.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They probably didn't have a ton of intention with what to do with their feet. And they were on a really good right hand, so as they were pulling, it pulled way off of that foot and it slipped. So it was not a very effective body position. Here we have the start position. Left hand on what looks to be kind of like a rounded sloping jug. So it's not a sharp jug, it's kind of bulbous. Those can be kind of difficult to grab sometimes. And this right hand is definitely on a proper sloper and a high left foot. So the climber is really pulling with this left toe and this left arm will lock off in order to kind of get into this space with the hips.

As she throws her arms back behind her, she's really stiff through this torso and also in her pelvis. You can see the stiffness continue down through the legs, so much so that the heels are hovering above the ground when they shouldn't be. She needs to really loosen up her movements here and stay connected to the rhythm, and find some clarity in her movements without that clarity creating stiffness. As a dancer performs a series of arm choreography, shooting out from above her, she's able to have precision in the shape of her arms and also in the movement dynamic here, which is an improvement from the steps prior. She's able to really clarify her movements here and get back on the rhythm. As the dancer is performing this series of arm choreography where she's punching down and then slicing her arms overhead She's lacking attention to dynamics here. All of her punches are lacking the direct strong movement quality that they need to be effective and in alignment with the music and Overall, she's getting really thrown off the rhythm here by not improving that dynamic quality As the dancer performs more punchy energetic movements like right here where she's punching her arms overhead and bringing her knee up to a sort of passe position in alignment with her supporting leg, she's able to move quickly and effectively and also incorporate some level of dynamics here which is an improvement. She has a nice line in her leg down through her foot in her knee and she's got a nice soft bend in the supporting leg which is keeping her steady as she moves quickly through this movement. As the dancer holds her hands to her head and undulates down towards the floor, she really rushes through the step and doesn't use the full articulation of the spine. In order to do so, she would need to separate the distance between her feet and her stance. She would also need to bend more in her knees and really drop that pelvis down towards the ground. She would also need to use her spine more fluently. She's kind of using her spine as one piece right now, which is creating a lot of stiffness in her movement. As the dancer begins this performance she shows she has a basic command over the movement technique here. She's able to perform turns quickly and efficiently as she's utilizing her head, spotting slightly, and keeping her movements all in this nice tight line underneath her shoulders. She also demonstrates that she's able to embody the rhythm through her movements, however she's not doing this at quite an expert level. She is doing it at a beginner intermediate level. As this dancer is performing her toe heel with the foot behind her, which is a small quick step, she's not able to perform this movement quite effectively because she's moving far too big, really moving this foot out and in rather than keeping the movement right underneath her. She's also got far too much movement in her torso and in her pelvis and even a little bit in her arms, which is making her too slow to perform this movement as quickly and effectively as she needs to to stay in alignment with the rhythm. As the dancer is performing quicker full body movements, she starts to get quite sloppy in her movement and less precise. Her knees are bent in towards one another here, sickled in, and her feet are not nearly as separated as they need to be to perform this movement. She's also getting quite sloppy in her arms, which are not making any sort of definitive shape. She's just kind of tossing her arm overhead in this moment. Overall, she appears quite stiff through her spine as she starts to move more quickly. She's struggling through the steps more significantly. As a dancer performs this kick backwards, she would really benefit from bending in this supporting knee more specifically, which would ground her closer to the floor and give her more balance and stability in her movement. She also is kicking her neck back quite significantly with her chin up towards the sky. She would benefit from keeping this more in line with her spine here, so that she's not extending her shoulders quite so far off the back of her along with that neck, and that everything's more in alignment with her torso.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Definitely better support there as you begin your shot. Eyes and head are up. Love that as well.  Again, this drill and her form and technique would be much improved if she would do a right-left takeoff, a little shuffling of the feet, not as balanced maybe in terms of getting that shot off. Again, great extension here of the rim, going up to the rim here. I would love to see maybe a little bit more takeoff on one foot and maybe pull this right knee up. But again, a two-foot takeoff is okay when you're learning this drill. Love how she gets herself ready, has two hands on the basketball as she makes her move with her movement to the right side of the basket. Her head and eyes are up. You like to see that as well. Here, she's, you know, this is wonderful. Eyes and head are up. She has got her head and eyes up on the target. She's not looking at her feet. She's not looking at the ball. Love to see that. Again, she's really just taking one step to improve that, maybe two big steps to give her power and lift on this shot.

Again, she's doing a two-foot takeoff. Nothing wrong with that, especially when you're learning this drill. Again, she has the right idea. We're not really concerned right now with the ball going in the hole. I think there would be more chance of success of this ball going in if she was a little bit more to the right. Because you see the ball's kind of going straight up. It needs to be angled more so it hits the square and has a chance to go in. Again, we'd love to see a big one-two step to gather momentum. But in this picture, she's got really good flexion of the hips and knees are bent, has the ball in two hands, her head and eyes are up. Shot would be improved with better footwork here. She kind of shuffles her feet instead of taking maybe a one, two step, big steps to the basket. Kind of shuffled her feet there in this camera view. This is a two foot takeoff, nothing wrong with that. She has really good elevation here, beautiful extension up to the rim. You could see it here in the first person view. That ball's up high.

So here, really nice job getting that spin around into the chest popping out to the side and then stepping over back to the right and switching his arms side to side. So again, keeping a really great energy, doing the steps accurately, just an overall really great job. So the dancer starts with some improvised movements to the beats, just really nice work keeping his energy up and just trying to find the groove of the music. So really nice just overall improvved movements. So there I think it just shows his level of musicality. He is able to stay on the rhythm, get all the steps, travel from one side to the other. So he uses space really well and is really just throwing his body into the movement and not holding back at all. So in the first couple of counts, he does a really great job staying to the music, executing all the steps with great energy.

Looking at the player going into his left-handed mic and layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice that again the player does well at incorporating some proper footwork by jumping off two feet. Also does well at keeping his right hand on the side of the ball before going into his release to create more security and protection on the ball. As well as locking his eyes on his target before going into his release, creating a much easier finish for the offensive player. Looking at the player going into his right-handed mic and layup attempt, we can notice that the player does a good job providing the proper footwork by jumping off two feet, allowing his body's momentum to carry him forward towards the right side of the rim. A slight improvement the player can make to avoid potential turnovers in a game-like scenario is bringing his ball placement position higher above his shoulder, allowing more space from opposing defenders, as well as creating more ball control and security on the finish. Looking at the release of the player's right-handed mic and layup attempt, some improvements the player can make to become more efficient is to jump closer towards the rim, allowing his body momentum to carry him closer towards the target area, allowing a much easier finish. We also want the player to get his shoulders more squared towards the back of the rim, allowing a better angle for the ball to travel accurately towards our target area. The player also does a good job keeping his ball placement position above his shoulder or at his shoulder level. Again, creating more ball control and security on the finish as well as creating space and separation from opposing defenders in a game-like scenario. The player also does a good job as we look on the right side of the frame on his right-handed Mike in layup attempt, jumping off the ground with full maximum effort, allowing the ball to gain more arc and rotation it needs to get above the rim to hit our target point, dropping inside the rim. Looking on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player does well at getting his follow through, going towards the direction of the rim, snapping his wrists almost towards the direction of the rim, allowing the ball to create the proper spin and rotation it needed to get towards our target point, hitting our target point, the top right corner of the box on the backboard, or allowing it to create the proper angle it needed of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the player going into his Right-handed micing layup attempt on the right frame some improvements the player can make to become more efficient Is to start his body placement position lower in the athletic stance allowing a much more balanced quicker Influent Attempt going towards the right side of the rim Looking at the release of the player's right-handed reverse layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice that the player did a good job of scoring his shoulders on the release towards the back of the rim, allowing the ball to create a better angle of being directed accurately towards our target area. Looking at the finished result from the player's attempted right-handed making layup on the left frame, we can notice that due to the player's lack of ability to jump closer towards the rim, as we look on the right side of the frame, we can see that the ball is hitting the outside of the rim, dropping back down, resulting in an incomplete layup attempt. We also want the player to improve looking on the right side of the frame, bringing his ball placement position closer towards his body, and raising it above his shoulders to create more ball security and control going into the finish.

It is part of the choreography, but not sure what steps those are. One thing that I noticed is that the dancer keeps swaying back and forth, which might be their own personal style, but the movement should definitely be more in the feet, where the body is moving and the feet are stepping, and the ways in which the body engages in the movement will be based on the isolations and being how the dancer moves those particular areas. So it's less so in the hips swaying and more so in the feet and the isolated parts of the body. This movement is very good. Dancers are in sync. They have a nice distance and connection.

As the dancer begins a basic salsa step, moving his feet outside to side and then returning to center, he demonstrates that he has a fairly comprehensive understanding of the movement vocabulary. He's got a lot of nice movement, particularly in his hips and lower body, and is able to engage the arms choreographically in a way that helps him embody the rhythm. As the dancer turns around himself, he would really benefit from an increased attention to spotting the head and his body shape as he's doing this turn. His turns appear to be quite slow and do get thrown off the rhythm just a little bit. If you were to tighten up his legs, bringing them closer together, spotting his head and pli\u00e9ing his knees or bending his knees just a bit more, he would be able to move more quickly and efficiently through the turn and transition into the next movement. As the dancer performs this cross step, he demonstrates that he's able to play with the rhythm using different tempos, different rhythms, and movement dynamics as he's performing these fairly basic salsa movements.

He gets around back facing the front. He's spotting his head around so he's not getting dizzy. But just really good job with the turns. So here I would say go up on the toes a little more, shift the weight forward, just because his feet are very flat. So you just want to keep, again, that lightness in your feet. So staying on your toes while keeping your knees bent will help a lot. And I think will also help to keep the flow and energy moving in the rest of his body. So the dancer starts stepping in place. He's picking up his feet off the floor. As he steps, his knees are slightly bent. He has really good use of his arms, kind of moving them around. And also his chest is moving a bit. The only thing I would say is try to move the hips a little bit harder in this step. I also noticed his head has kind of stayed in the same form and shape the entire time. It hasn't really moved. So just keeping in mind, like, when you're doing this style of dance, your whole body should be moving in fluid. There's no part that's ever isolated or just standing still unless the choreography calls for that, but the steps that he's doing, everything really needs to come into play. And that should really adjust from his spine up to his head to keep everything moving.

And here he appears to add his seasoning to the cucumber mixture, which is garam masala or cumin or coriander, some Indian seasoning. Now he realizes that he needs to have the mixing bowl to complete this recipe. And again, I'm not certain if this is his working knowledge or this knife just appears to be very dull, but he has a very hard time getting that initial cut lengthwise to go through his cucumber coins. He seems relatively comfortable with this type of cutting board with a knife attached. However, he does have his fingertips right up against the blade of the knife, and it appears that the blade is rather dull. After transferring the tomatoes to the bowl, he then has to transfer the cucumbers from the plate to the bowl. He could have eliminated this step by having the mixing bowl on hand at the beginning of the recipe. This is a slow and very misguided approach to chopping a tomato. Efficiently, you would want to chop it lengthwise and then create lengthwise slices before chopping it across the grain. Here it seems that he's taking each quarter and slowly chopping that into a fine dice. And here, if you look close, you can see at the bottom of the bowl, there is a ton of liquid in this salad. Additionally, he is missing a key ingredient of salt. Maybe there is salt in the seasoning mixture, but it's unclear why salt was not added. Again, whether this is his technique or the dullness of the knife, he seems to have a very hard time slicing this tomato fully with just the blade. He's having to take the vegetable and move it in order to finalize the chop. Obviously, a fourth of a cup of seasoning added on top of one cucumber and one small tomato is too much seasoning. One teaspoon, up to one tablespoon would have been sufficient. Step one of making a cucumber and tomato salad is to gather your tools that you'll use to execute the task and your ingredients. Here he has a cutting board with a knife attached to it. First, he appears to add one teaspoon or one tablespoon. But then he looks like he decides to pour the entire bowl onto the cucumber mixture, which appears to be about a fourth of a cup. That would be way too much acid for this amount of vegetables. Here to note that he transfers the cucumber back to this plate, which is not his mixing bowl. This creates a process where he's moving that product two times. Later in the video, you'll see that he moves it back to the mixing bowl. This indicates to me that he doesn't necessarily know all of the appropriate tools that he needed at the beginning of the recipe. And so he didn't grab the mixing bowl, which creates a two-step process for the cucumbers. This indicates to me that he has not made this recipe prior to this video and that he doesn't have a good working knowledge of the amounts that are consistent in producing this task. Here you can see that he's struggling to get all of his slices into a single line so that he can chop them lengthwise. He grabs one small cucumber and begins to slice it crosswise into half inch or fourth inch thick rounds.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

Can he jump higher? I think so. Love the extension of the elbow, the snapping of the wrists, guide hand is here on the side. Beautiful extension of the hips here on the release. Kind of starting to get off his feet here a little bit. Here's his elbow. The ball's coming off the fingers last. Here's that guide hand. Great job with not putting the guide hand on the ball on the release. So when he catches it, you can see his footwork here. It's really slow. And I don't mean that in a negative way. It's just, it's gonna take him a while to get it off. Therefore he's gonna be defended. So why don't we step this left foot aggressively, bring the right leg in aggressively when you catch it. Here there's just little footwork, just a little small step. He holds it here a little bit too long. Here on the release, he kind of short arms his follow-through a little bit. It's a little bit down too low. Let's get that follow-through up. He also jerks back that non-shooting hand as well, and you can see that in the image here. Let's square these shoulders and hips up. It looks like he turns that right leg in a little bit. Let's get our whole body square to the basket. Again, he catches it because he's not really ready to catch and shoot. So when he catches it, there's like a hesitation or a pause here. And just that split second, that pause is going to cause a defender to then now defend you. So we got to be quicker stepping in and meeting the pass. And then we got to catch and shoot a little bit quicker here. You see the footwork, his feet are really close together. My recommendation is to really step in with that left foot, pull the right foot up and then elevate. Here it's just a little bit too slow. Here you see him, here's the pass coming his way. He's kind of upright. His feet are together. Again, in this drill, my recommendation is the shooter drop his hips, bend his knees, and step one, two to meet this pass to get more lift and elevation and make it more game-like. Ultimately, that's what we want to do in these drills. Go game, speed. Again, he takes a little extra step here with his right foot, therefore it's out here in front. Again, let's square our hips to the basket. I like how the ball's sitting back on his shooting hand. He's caught that wrist back. Guide hand is here on the side. Again, here's the release. Beautiful follow-through extension of the right shooting arm. Wrist snaps down. You see all four fingers pointing down to the floor. That's really, really nice. Guide hand is not in the shot. It's here on the side. Pretty good verticality here. Start to see a little air under his feet, which is good. Here's the release. Pretty good extension here of the right shooting elbow. You see that that arm, it kind of followed through a little bit across his body instead of straight on. Again, let's get this left elbow of the non-shooting arm parallel to the floor. This is really nice. Beautiful extension, snapping of the wrist, fingers down, guide hand on the side. My only continued recommendation is let's get this elbow, the non-shooting hand, elbow in. It kind of goes out a little bit. Again, let's square this, our feet and this right hip facing more to the basket. But the ball looks like it's leaving the hand, has good, good arc to the basket. Here are the shooters shooting a 15-footer. Beautiful extension of the right elbow, the shooting arm. You can see in the egocentric view. Pretty perfect. Beautiful extension. Snapping down of the shooting wrist. The fingers are pointing down and spread. Has nice arc on the ball to the basket. The guide hand, the palm of that guide hand, that non-shooting hand is facing inward. My only recommendation is I bring that left elbow in and have that forearm more parallel to the ground. Pretty good lift here. This right hip may be turned in just a tad on this shot, but good extension and elevation here. I probably could lift up even more if he would prepare a little bit more ahead of time and meet that pass and drive those hips into the shot. Here's where he raises it up. He does bend his knees here a little bit. Here the shooting elbow looks like it's a little bit out. Let's bring that elbow in under the ball. In this view, it does really look like he's bringing the ball really a little bit back behind his head. You'd like to shoot it from the forehead. Again, waiting to meet this pass, he kind of just standing straight up. He does have his hands up. We'd love to see him backstop it with his right hand right here, because that's his shooting hand, and just that guide hand can just help bring it into that right hand. But let's let's bend our knees, let's drop our hips, let's get our feet apart and really step into this pass. Here comes the shot. He's got a pretty good hand placement on the ball. You can see the shooting hand and the fingers spread on the ball. His guide hand is here on the side. I do like that his feet are now apart. He's stepping a little bit with the right foot forward. I would love for him to jump up vertically, to go up straight. Here the elbows have a tendency to kind of pop out a little bit. Let's bring these elbows in under the basketball. Here comes the pass. You could see he's really just kind of waiting for the ball. He's not going to meet it with a with I call a one-two step. And again, the reason you want to meet this pass is you don't want a defender to step in there in a game situation between you and the ball and steal it. So you got to meet your pass in any of those situations. I like that he's got his hands out. He's starting to reach his hands out, but let's extend them more out to meet the pass. Again, beautiful extension of the right arm, the shooting arm and hand. Here, the fingers may be a little close together, but not bad. I love the inside of that palm of that non-shooting hand facing in. Again, let's move the elbow of that guide hand, the non-shooting arm in. I really feel like, again, this player could get more lift and legs in his shot. He's barely getting off the floor. I think he has a capability of lifting and elevating and shooting that ball at the height of his jump.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

In some cases it might be, you know, if you have really bad feet, that's gonna take more energy to try to stay on the feet. Sometimes it can be more beneficial to campus. I don't know if this is one of those cases or if you're just kind of missing the heel hook out right. Even in this you can kind of see how much he takes his right arm off to move it up to this hold. And his whole body doesn't really change position. It's not like it's some drastic thing that he has to move really fast to. He's able to really just kind of sling through and move slowly. This is just the starting movement. The right foot is on, the left foot is kind of balanced and tensioned out, so he makes the first move. But just how all that coming together, setting up his upper body to his lower body, and keeping that set up once he starts, really lets him flow together on this first move. Now he's obviously on some bigger holds so it looks like it's pretty easy for him, but instead of opting to get his feet back on, and his feet do kind of run out here, but he's got this big pinch side pull thing that he can put a heel on and free up his right foot, but instead he kind of opts out and tries to campus up the wall. Here you can see his left foot kicking, and I think this is the one spot that would have him use maybe a little bit more tension. So he's right hand on, right foot on, and his left foot's kind of just flopping around as he reaches up. You know, albeit it's a good hold, it's pretty positive. But if he could have, you know, immediately, instinctually, once he had that right hand, right foot, and it was high, he could have backflagged right away onto that hold, or backflagged out to the right, tension up and move more slowly through this section, a little bit more control. Because every time that leg flops out, it's kind of pulling him out away from the wall. So, we have like this pre-climbing ritual. So, he kind of, you know, uses his hands to like kind of mimic what he's going to do for the sequence. So, when he kind of gets to it in the climb, he kind of has an idea of what is coming. It feels like he's maybe climbed before. He's got some muscle memory to rely on. I like this move too, so you can see he's, you know, this, this, uh, he doesn't match on the hold. He doesn't, and then go up, uh, left hand first, his hold, he keeps his, uh, matching to a minimum. So he just was able to pull off the left hand where a lot of people would go match and then left hand up. He just kind of crosses his right arm to here. Um, and this hold is kind of a side pull. So the optimal position is gonna be up over here. So you can see his arm kind of is bent and he's having to engage and kind of pull, but he's moving his feet up to slowly let them kind of wrap and slink around to the left side so you can more, uh, pull against like the positive edge of the hold and kind of more relaxed into it. And again, once he makes these moves, he's not really fighting anything, he keeps his arms straight, and he's kind of moving his feet and then shifting into the next position, which is kind of like a repeat of how he started the route. You grip it, then you kind of skid into the position, you kind of just want to get more and more into the position as it allows. So I like this he hasn't even put his feet on but you can see he He goes from like standing at the hold gripping it really hard and like gripping it how he wants to To slowly lowering himself down. So now he's below the hole. Those feet are still on the floor And now he's kind of so he's still got the fingers engaged now he's kind of getting the arms tensioned and like where he wants his upper body to be and Kind of hanging out below the hold and now he's kind of gonna sink in and kind of move his feet in So that's gonna ensure that he's you know one got a really good setup on the start handhold But also it's gonna sure that he's got his feet really loaded and tensioned up And that everything's kind of working together and feels good", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

It just needs to be one fluid motion here. But love this, love this, excellent. here you know what a lot of shooters do this just really pushing off the left foot and like fading back sometimes they watch too much of the pros doing all this but you know it looks good but you know he's weights needs to be more evenly distributed I love that he's lifting off the ground beautiful extension here doesn't get any better than that let's get that left elbow in palm facing inward it looks really nice he's just falling backwards a little bit could throw off the shot Again, I just can't emphasize this as much as possible. Like, just being a ready shooter, like, you know, it's hard to really execute this drill to the 10 unless you're really stepping in and meeting this pass, bending your body down, having your weight down, bending your knees, dropping your hips. But, you know, at the end of the day, he's got his hands ready. He's a right-hand shooter. Let's backstop it with his right hand. It's a lot quicker. You catch it, shot. If he catches it with his left hand, then he's got to move it to his right hand. And that second or two can cause the defense to guard you. And you're not going to get your shot off. Here he kind of steps to the left a little bit on his landing. You know, at the end of the day, you just you want as little movement as possible. You know, you want to go straight up, straight down, be real soft on the balls of your feet on the landing, hold that follow-through. You just want it to be one simple movement. Any extra, like, you know, jerking back, falling backward, falling one side the other is going to throw off the accuracy of the shot. Again, not a lot of lift. If he could step more into this pass, he could get more jumping. But this looks really, really good here. Flexion here, elbows at 90 degrees, the ball sits back on his hand to shoot it. He's got his fingers spread. Really nice. Here he receives the pass. He kind of bends his knees in together a little bit, kind of as he crouches to shoot it. You want more of an explosive, like step into this pass and one, two, and lift. Here he kind of squeezes the knees together to get his power. This is really good. I like this. Elbow in maybe just a tad, but this looks really good with his hand behind the ball and that guide hand is just offering some token pressure there to help raise it and lift it for the shot. Here, again, he's going off this left foot. Again, just let's evenly distribute our weight here. Beautiful beginning of the extension of the arm. The ball comes off the pads of the fingers. Look how they're nicely spread. And that guide hand looks pretty good. Again, gets the ball up to the height of his jump. This is really, really, really nicely done. The landing, he kind of falls backwards here a little bit. You really couldn't see it here, but again just, you know, bend those knees. Let's get, let's get our body a little bit more square. Get these shoulders facing the basket. Again, he's kind of turned a little bit to the inside or to the left. Beautiful shot, beautiful extension. Let's get that guide hand here on the side, elbow in. But I start to see some air there. But really relying on pushing off with that left foot. I would really recommend going off two feet. Here the shooter receives the pass. You know, he's got his feet staggered, but I would love for him to drop his hips and then lift his body. He kind of steps with his right foot here a little bit more. I love the fact that he gets the ball up high quickly. This is really nice here with the ball sitting on his shooting right hand, elbows bent. This is what it should look like. I'm trying to see if this is his guide hand. It's on the side, just token pressure there. Again, he kind of bends his knees inward. Let's evenly distribute this weight so we can catch and go straight up. This looks really good. It's more of what he's doing before he catches it because once he's caught it, it looks really good. here his weight he kind of falls back again a lot of the weight falls on the left foot I can tell just slightly again let's bend those knees hold that follow through Here's the release. So, I mean, he could jump even higher if he would step into it. That's why I say that. But he's got pretty good... he's elevating here a little bit. I love it that his hips are extended. Beautiful. Better extension of the shooting arm. Great breaking of the wrists. Let's get this guy's elbow, this left arm, get this elbow parallel to the floor, that forearm parallel to the floor. But looks good. Here you go, just really pushing off the left foot, throwing that right leg up. He's feeling it here, I think, but, you know, falling backwards, I think it's the last shot of the drill, but love his extension, love his energy, enthusiasm here. Beautiful follow through as the ball elevates to the basket. Again, he kind of short arms it. Let's hold this follow through high and lengthen that elbow. When he lands, he kind of is a little straight legged. Let's bend those knees. Keep our body square or facing the basket. Looks like he kind of turned a little bit to the left. Let's stay square. That means keep your shoulders and hips facing the basket. So, on the follow-through, let's extend this shooting elbow more. I just sometimes call this short arm in it, where you kind of hitch it back. The guide hand looks pretty good, but let's extend this elbow. Let's break that. He's got the wrist broken. Just extend that elbow more. He's got some extension here. Leaves the ground just a little bit. I think he can get more power and lift if he would step more into this pass.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And this one so that that left hand is being held onto the right side just above the right grip. So both hands on the same hold this is called matching and the climber does this position in a way so that he can find a way to lay back. Next hand to be released could potentially be the lower one as the climber will need to extend out right. Here we can see the climber sort of testing the holes before getting onto the wall. The right hand is positioned as a normal grip where the fingers will slide into the donut and the thumb is used as for a pinch to sustain the hold. And on the other side, the climber as he's getting lowered has placed the palm to be facing up with the fingers sliding into the donut as well. But it seems as that would not be ideal for the start move. Here we can see the climber, his hand position was not the best. That's because both of the grips were stacking one on top of the other, creating unnecessary pressure done by the left hand that was above and pressuring the top of the right hand. That is not a very comfortable position as it's like over gripping and can hurt the hand for the climber or even worse, not be able to release the right hand for the move. Here we can see the climber getting himself positioned, each hand holding onto a donna. This is called a two-hold start. Now as we can see the climber has flipped the right hand to be also gripped with the thumb being supported for a pinch. Once the climber gets to hold onto the grips above, it's keeping the arms extended. This way it can add more pressure to the grips above. Once the climber gets to place the feet on the wall and the body is off the mat, then the climber starts.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

A slight improvement the player can make is again bringing that ball placement position above his shoulders to allow more ball security and control going into the finish, also creating a quicker release. However, the player does an excellent job of jumping off his correct leg, which is going to be his right leg, allowing him and his body's momentum to guide him forward towards the rim, allowing a much easier finish. Looking at the player going into his left-handed mic and layup attempt, we can notice on the left frame the player does an excellent job of having his follow-through go towards the direction of the basket, allowing the ball to hit exactly on our target point, which is going to be the top left corner of the box on the backboard, allowing it to develop the accurate angle and ease of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the player going into his attempt on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player does a good job of using the correct foot as we look on the right frame, jumping with his left leg, allowing his body's momentum to carry him towards the right side of the rim. However, we do want the player to have his left hand still on the ball before going into his release, again to create more ball control, security, going into the finish. Looking at the release of the players left-handed mic and layup attempt, we can notice that the player does a good job in the left frame having his follow through go towards the direction of the basket allowing the ball to travel that same way with the right amount of rotation and spin it needs to hit around our target area which is going to be the top left corner of the box on the backboard allowing the ball to create the proper angle it needs of dropping inside the rim Looking at the finished result of the players attempted right-handed mic and layup, we can notice on the left frame the player did a great job of allowing the ball to develop the proper angle and rotation with the right amount of force needed to drop inside the rim, resulting in a completed layup attempt. Looking at the player going into his right-handed, Mike can lay up attempt on the right frame. We can notice that the player does really well at getting his follow-through going towards the direction of the hoop, which allows the ball to create the proper spin and rotation to travel towards our target area. Looking on the right frame, we can notice that the player's body's momentum is slightly bringing him away from the rim. We will want the player to jump with full maximum effort, allowing his body momentum to carry him forward towards the rim, allowing a much easier and quicker finish for the offensive player. Looking at the player going into his right-handed mic and layup attempt, some improvements the player can make to become more efficient is to start his body placement position as we look on the right side of the frame, lower in an athletic stance going towards the rim. This will allow the player to become quicker, more on balance, and more powerful going into his jumping motion on the right side of the rim. Looking at the player going into his left-handed Mike and layup attempt, we can notice that the player does a good job of stepping and jumping with his right leg, allowing his body momentum to carry him towards the left side of the hoop. A slight adjustment the player can make is to bring his ball placement position towards his shoulder area above his shoulder, preferably to allow more ball control and security going into the finish, also allowing a closer gap of releasing the ball quicker towards our target area. Looking at the release of the player's offensive right-handed Mike and Leah Patent, we can notice on the left frame the player does a good job of getting his follow-through, snapping towards the direction of the rim, which allows the ball to create the proper spin and rotation it needs to travel towards our target area, which is going to be the top right corner of the box on the backboard, allowing the ball to develop the proper angle it needs to drop inside the rim. Looking at the player going into his right-handed mic-in layup attempt, another improvement the player should make to become more efficient on his attempts is to bring his ball placement position higher above his shoulders, with his left hand still on the side of the ball before the release. This will allow the player to have more ball control and security going into the release, also allowing a closer and quicker gap of releasing the ball towards our target. And last but not least, allowing more protection from opposing defenders in a game-like scenario to have access of stripping, taking or stealing the ball from the offensive player.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

There's no problem if he can generate force, but this player is not capable of doing that given his skill level. So I would actually recommend that he start another step back where he can take more steps then into the ball and create more speed moving this direction. He's also just missed two shots in a row, so having a reset and taking a breath and calming down between the reps and taking his time, he would also very much benefit from that, more like a real penalty kick sequence. Right now he's rushing through each repetition. So going back to the right side of the goal as he's aiming for this area, so he just had a really nice little short run up to the ball. His plant foot is facing that direction. His hips are naturally aligned to that direction based off of that. That's great. He used the inside of the foot as a kicking surface. That's been very clean. And then now the follow-through. You can see that he's following through in the direction of the intended target. That's something that we would ask players to do. You can almost over exaggerate this motion to help give the ball extra direction. And I think he's done a good job here. So this shows a picture of what we would like to see. Because he isn't taking big run-ups into the ball, his whole kicking action sort of stops with his foot planted here and he doesn't move any more forward. If he were taking a bigger run-up, which could be recommended, so that he runs through the ball as he kicks it and almost land on that kicking foot, that would continue even more trajectory or more force and direction into his intended target. So, in terms of the run up, because this was a short one, even shorter than the first two, where he took one step with his left foot into here, he's using then the inside of the foot technique, which makes the most sense because he's not generating any momentum into the ball. So, using the laces or the instep would be a lot harder to generate power. This would be it from a close distance like this. This could be a technique that is used for more accuracy and finesse to place the ball away from a goalkeeper. So, this could definitely be utilized. In terms of the plant foot, this was directly next to the ball or as close to the ball as it could be on this side. So, that was good. The knee is soft, it's bent. His head is slightly over the ball, but like that he's not leaning too far backwards in his stance, which is good. And then you can see the technique with his foot is toe up, heels down, lower, so the angle of the foot looks more like that. He's hitting the ball, center of the foot, right, center of the ball to keep it low. And so that's good. I like all those contact points and the technique that he's being used in this picture. You can see he's giving the ball direction towards the corner. So overall, a nice picture. So in terms of where the ball is going, the best targets that he could hit would be to the sides here of both. Now he doesn't have a goalkeeper in the goal or a direct opponent, but you could see now this is a couple shots in a row, two or three shots in a row now where this ball is going in and around the central box, the central area, which is an area that is largely dominated by a goalkeeper. So the target that I would recommend that he try to hit every single time would be to of the sides of the goalkeeper, which would be a much higher percentage chance of actually scoring. So here, just examining that inside the foot kicking technique at the moment of impact, he's actually too, like the plant foot is faced this way. The plant foot or the kicking foot, you can see where the toe is facing as he kicks it, which actually then makes the contact point more closer to the heel, which is now forcing the ball to go wide of the goal. Right, so nothing really wrong with the plant foot. I mean, it's facing where he wants to go, which is this target. He needs to close the angle of this foot up a little bit though, so that he's striking it more like this, and it's hitting the inside of the foot here, and then he follows through towards the target. It's just a contact thing at this point. And he's leaning a little bit too far back, which is also opening his hip up more towards the side of the goal. So that's something that we would want to correct, where he's a little bit more over the ball with his head, and following through towards that intended target. So this is a different technique. This is using the instep of his foot where the toe is more pointed down and the heels up and the knee slightly over the ball at the moment of impact. And you can really clearly see from this picture what that looks like. In order to make the space for him to be able to do that, his left foot is planted like a little bit wider of the ball which you can see, and it's also slightly behind the ball at this point. He's leaning a little bit more away from the ball in this direction, and that gives space for him to be able to swing his foot and use that surface of the top of the foot. One thing though that's happening is that the way in which his hips are facing because of the direction of his foot, which is more this direction, his follow through, once he strikes, the ball will naturally be more across the face of the ball so he's contacting it here and then bringing his foot this way as opposed to contacting the ball more central and bringing his foot through the ball towards a target. So it's essentially doing two things. One, that will slice the ball. It'll slice the ball where that will go here and his foot will come follow through that direction and it will generate less force, less power on the ball. So the recommendation here would be that plant foot a little bit more higher next to the ball can still be a little bit wider and that would allow him then to naturally align his hip better towards whatever target it is. If it's the center of the goal or this side, that would be that. And then that would allow his follow through to go in that same direction. The subject is performing a penalty kick shot where the ball is being placed in a stationary position. He's taking an approach of taking steps back and then taking a run-up into the ball and then striking the ball into an open goal. So here there's no direct opponent. So we're looking at one the consistency of this setup what that looks like. The angle of the run-up in the approach. Is it a straight on angle? Is it to the side? So we're gonna evaluate what it is and then what that does. Here you can see the angle is a little bit it's a little bit hard in the sense of it's a it's a an angle that makes it difficult for him to hit the ball to this side. So he's gonna have to bring his foot really across his body if that's something that he wants to do. It's much easier for him at this point with this angle of approach to hit the ball to this side of the goal. So something to consider in terms of deception and deceiving a goalkeeper at times he could take a little bit more of a lighter angle onto the ball or if he hits from this angle the quality of his run-up needs to be quick and his leg action needs to be quick that if he hits it across his body that the ball comes with a lot of speed to get across the goalkeeper. So you can see here as we go back to this left side that he's not hitting that corner target and that has to do completely with that plant foot being more towards the middle and then him having to hit the ball and try to bring the ball over here. And so this is the outcome of that is that you have a ball that ends up much more closely related to where a goalkeeper would be positioned, which could be a much easier save if a goalkeeper reads the ball or anticipates that correctly. So the easy fix again would be for that plant foot as he places it next to the ball to be aligned more towards that direction so that he could better bring that right hip across and follow through towards this target as he strikes the ball. So this is the opposite of what we just saw where, you know, the plant foot is not next to the ball. You can see it's slightly behind the ball. It's number one. Number two is that toe is facing the center of the goal, which will naturally bring his left hip in relation to that center of the goal. But he's aiming for a target over in this direction here, towards this corner. So this is just going to be a little bit more difficult for him naturally because if his hip on this side is facing this way, it's going to be harder to rotate that hip this way as he kicks the ball in that direction over here. So what I think he could do to change this is get that foot next to the ball, but point that pointer toe in that direction, which will help naturally align his hips. And then he can use a inside the foot kicking technique to place it in the corner. One thing I noticed right away with the second repetition is that the distance for his how he's coming back and creating a run-up is much smaller than it was before. I would recommend that he establish a routine and that this become very consistent with the amount of space that he gives himself to run up into the ball.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Be able to just kind of apply all that pressure through it. And that's going to free his right hand just to come up, up and over and hit this handhold. Again, works on this nice back flake, so he's right hand on, right foot. So he flakes this left foot back behind him. Still not a super rigid, so a little bent, so you could kind of clean that up and really sink down into it. But that kind of lets him bounce out, so he can just kind of casually reach up with his left hand. He does a good job of when he cuts his feet and then recovers, he kind of saves his body to the left so he's kind of underneath this hold more. So he can kind of relax and play around with his feet and get his feet where they need to go. And this kind of move seems like it wastes a little bit of energy. He hangs out one arm quite a bit and kind of just lets his left hand drop down before kind of slowly adjusting and going up to this big hold. So he could probably move a little bit faster, keep both his hands on. And by doing that he's able to really kind of Get his sequence on his hands And he's kind of does this crossover so instead of matching he's kind of getting his hands swapped on there So that higher right spot might or the higher left spot for his right hand might be a little bit more positive Which kind of ease up and let him go up to this next hole a little bit easier I like this move so he could go off this lower foot and drive up and over to this handhold, but he opts to use his heel hook. So he's going to replace this hand, he's going to be able to pull straight through that hold, take all that tension. And so then he cuts his feet, I think just by balancing on keeping a little extra tension not having that other leg flop around, you could kind of prevent a lot of these foot cuts. And then again he's dropping the hand down. So he's kind of wasting energy. And he's not really using this left foot for anything. This left foot's kind of just dangling. It's almost back plaguing, but he could just keep it a lot more rigid, let it post into the wall, and let it kind of drive him to the left. But he's kind of opting out of that. So he kind of unintentionally maybe goes into the backflip a little bit, but he goes up left hand, but he's got his right hand, right foot, and his left foot kind of kicks back around. So that's kind of his body just kind of bouncing out. I'm not sure if it was on purpose or if it just kind of flung that way and just kind of bounced out on its own. But he does work on a little backflip there to get a little more control on that left hand. So then again, cuts his feet again, but he's on two positive holds, so it doesn't seem as bad. But it does look like maybe he's getting tired and not as good at holding the tension as he moves through the row. But the handles are big enough that he's still able to hold on and keep going. And then again, he's right hand, right foot, so his left leg is kind of just dangling out here so he could kind of straighten it out, kind of smear into the wall and push, create tension with it or you get the balance out. And so just let it flop around. I like this, how he readjusts so there may not be room for his left hand, so he goes back down to this lower hand hold to kind of pace himself and set himself up for the next move. So he kind of recycles that hold with his left hand. It's really nice, he kind of gains control of his hold and he kind of segs down off of it so that way he's not really fighting it. He's able to kind of relax into it to kind of readjust.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As you can see, this guy hand is open, fingers pointing towards the basket, palm facing in the direction of his shooting hand. The shooting hand, you can't see the back of his hand because he did a really good follow through, but everything is pointing towards the basket. There's nothing off to the side this way or off to the side that way. Everything is headed towards our target, whether it be the guy, the shooting hand and the guy hand, they're all pointing in the direction of where we want the ball to go, which is into the basket. If you take a look at his left guide hand, you can see that the majority of his left hand is behind the ball. Which means that his left hand is actually in the path of where we want the ball to go. So he's actually blocking his own shot as he goes up to shoot. The only way he's able to let the ball go in the direction where he wants it to go, which is towards the basket, is for him to flex his wrist out this way in order for his fingers to clear a path and open up and allow the ball to go straight. So that is an unnecessary movement that is not needed. When it comes to shooting, we want to eliminate all the excess movements within your shot. So if we can slide his hand down more and place it more on the side of the ball, that will put his hand already in the position where as he goes to shoot it, it's already opened up and in the position that is needed for the ball to go straight. And so that eliminates a small unnecessary movement within his shot. The more excess movements that we eliminate from someone's shot, the more consistent that person's shot becomes. Let's take a look at the placement of his right hand. His right hand is on the side of the ball. And since his right hand is on the side of the ball, you take a look at this angle, you can see his elbow is out sideways at that angle when we need it to be more vertical up and down with that elbow as he's raising it up into his shot. As we take a look at the release of the ball, you can see his guy hand, he opened up his wrist so that his fingers were no longer behind the ball. He opened it up to clear a path for the ball to go straight towards the basket. See the positioning of his hand right now is how ideally we would want his hand to be once he has the ball on the catch and he begins the motion of his shot. At the end of his shot, he opens up his wrist and his hand and puts it in the correct position. Ideally we want this wrist action to be like this from the very start of his shot. If we take a look at his right wrist, as you can see, we can't see the back of his hand because he snapped his wrist down and let the ball roll off his fingertips creating really good backspin on the ball. Now the ball has good backspin. If we take a look right here, his elbow is slightly above his eye level. When you combine the good placement of his feet and the good power generated from his legs, combine that with his elbow being above the eye, that allows for us to get this nice arc on the shot and we knock the shot down. We can take a look at his feet. He has good placement of his right foot as his right foot is slightly in front of his left foot. With your feet aligned this way as a right handed shooter with your right foot slightly in front of your left hand, that allows for your elbow to be more in line and straight up with the basket. However, because of the placement of his left hand on the side of the ball, that forces his elbow to be flared out more. So if we were to slide this finger over more to the middle portion of the basketball, that would allow for his elbow to be more in and lined up with the basket.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This can compromise the climb as the climber will have to over grip to sustain herself from falling and trying to recover the move. However, we can see from the left hand how the depth of that lip of the hold is more positive than the right hand grip that she's sustaining above. the clambor and switching the feet with keeping the left leg extended. This is called flagging out and is to control hair position and balance when performing the next move. However, the left hand seems to have lost grip pressure so the clambor is reapplying the grip onto the hold. This one is a slight jog but because the lip is sticking out and is not as far in depth to be positioned upright, the clambor is actually pinching into the hold and it's important that she pulls it over in the right direction which means that she needs to keep the elbow down and close to the wall to sustain the grip. And once the clambor is able to apply the pinch, then the clambor will be able to lean back to transfer over the weight to the grips. The climbers are starting at a one-hole start and as we can see both of the hands are placed into the same hole. This is called matching. The climber places it over a jug where it has an indent where the climber can place the fingers behind the lip of the hole. Now the climber starts until the feet are no longer standing on the mat and are placed onto the wall. In this case, the climber had brought the left foot to come into place first and brings the right foot at a high stance, looking at the next hole at reach. The climber has come in contact with the mat due to loosened pressure of the feet, which means that the climb has ended. Now, if the climber was to attempt this move again, it's important that the climber immediately, when placing the left foot onto the hold, she continues to apply pressure of the right toe to stay in place. And once the climber secures the left toe placement, then she can release with control the right foot. As we can see the climber had sent the right foot back out to the original hold where she had placed the right foot and Has dropped the left foot from its place with the leg extended This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place And having the flag helps the climber to also Support and keeping the center of gravity close to the wall as she performs the twist of her shoulders To bring the right shoulder up to send The hand to the hold that reach Now as we can see the climber can remain underneath the hold that reach being in this position however, we can see her fingers are being placed above the hold and She wraps the thumb around the edge of that hold to sustain the grip. This is a flat surface type of hold so the climber must Continue to close the grip in order to create friction of the skin Towards the hold once the climber gets to find the catch then she will be able to lean back To transfer over the weight to the highest grip At this moment the climber is glancing down, retracting the right foot placement to bring it over to a match at the foot chip Where she brings the right toe to come into place at the hold. This one being a small, the climber is being metatautical by swiveling the left foot out So the climber can get to place the toe of the right foot above the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So their head moves really sharp and then their body follows quickly. So I mentioned it earlier in the video, so I wanted to spot out or highlight that this is a great example of that. Here, in order to save and conserve their energy, I would encourage them to bend their knees and engage their core in order to exert less energy for this intermediate salsa. I would encourage the dancer to be very clear on when they should be on the balls of their feet versus when they should be flat-footed. This would encourage with the buoyancy and energy throughout the movement because they're doing all this amazing work and all this footwork and in demonstrating such musicality and attention to detail in their arms and engaging that core, but really being clear on whether their articulation of the feet would take it to the next level and save them some energy in this intermediate salsa. Here the dancer uses their arm a lot and they're pretty sharp when they use their arm. To further encourage the sharpness that we've seen in previous videos, I would encourage them to continue to pay close attention from their wrists all the way to their fingertips and make sure that that has as much energy as their arms do so it looks like a great attention to detail. I would encourage the dancer to think about the quality of breath because they're so great at executing the movement. So think about how the breath can give longevity or agility to the movement so they don't feel tired or out of breath as they looked in the first section of the video, because they're doing all this incredible work, but breath control will help them maintain doing this great, amazing work. Here for the scoop unders that they do, kind of scoop with their arms and then scoop and their their legs are moving side to side so they go scoop with the arms and scoop with the arms. I would encourage them to take bigger steps so they can plie or bend their legs even further so their scoop almost touches the ground like they're holding a bowl and then they can scoop again and touch the ground like they're holding a bowl and come up even bigger. This would give it more dynamic quality and is more closer to the roots of salsa and it's like African aesthetic and technique so digging into getting closer to the grounds would help with that dynamic quality and intermediate salsa and pay homage to its roots. Here, the dancer does a really great job of doing isolations or moving one part of their body at a time. They go backside, front, arm, arm, head, roll. And so, in order to do that more efficiently, I would encourage them to be very sharp on what they're doing and over anticipate their movements. But overall, really great job. Here, I would encourage the dancer to be quicker about spotting their head or quicker on what direction they want to turn. So you look first and then you turn. So I would, when they look, I would encourage them to look even quicker and even sharper in order to be able to turn faster. This would give them more efficiency of movement and allow them to again turn quicker.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

To do this, the climber avoiding from swinging out completely, he will need to create body tension, meaning engage the core and bring the feet up. However, because the climber stood up lastly on the right foot to press and driving his direction away from the wall, we can see how his body has been shifted to have his chest face the opposite side. This because the climber had engaged forcefully on the reach. So this automatically will make his body face the opposite direction of the reach. So in this instance, the climber must force the grip in order to sustain the move. It's important that when the climber finally gets to engage on the stance, the climber pulls himself in as much as he can. This to bring his center of gravity with him to get as close as he can to the wall. It's important that he will bring then his chest first in to then the hips to follow while he pushes down on the feet to generate a jump up to the hold. The climbers is starting it at a two hand hold start, meaning that each hand has its own hold and as we can see both of them are donuts. Meaning that the right hand hold at least is curved in so the climber is able to sustain a positive grip, meaning that he's able to wrap the hand around it by keeping the thumb on the outside to generate more force when on the grip. On the left hand, the donut is not as positive, but in order to create pressure he places the fingers on the inside and leans back to create pressure on the hold. The climb will start until the climber's feet are on the wall, which he is doing right now and this is his first positioning. As we can see the right foot is placed on a positive hold, meaning a big hold that he can place his entire toe box over it. And now the climber's feet are on the wall, then the climb starts. Here, the swing has been more powerful than the climber being able to apply pressure on the grip, which is making the climber now lose pressure at the grip by having a feeling of getting peeled off due to slightly having his elbow already not underneath where the climber's hand placement is. This will create a peel motion and as the climber is already making himself way down, the right foot will be positioned on the mat and the climb will be over. The moment that the climber stepped up on the right foot, which was the highest foot placed, you can see how the climber first was going parallel with the wall on his body. And the moment he stepped, he shifted his direction slightly out. This will continue to send the climber away from the wall if he doesn't get to make the reach by palming the hold above. Here we can see the climber swinging forcefully. This is so that the climber is able to generate power before going up for an explosive stance, meaning that the climber will need to leap up in the air to make the reach up to this big green hold. This is called a dyno. So the climber will be leaping up in the air for a matter of seconds, not touching any holes until he makes a placement of the right hand up to the hold. It's important that the climber aims exactly which area of the edge he's trying to get at as it will be necessary for sustaining the move.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And then I would anticipate maybe on the left, since she took two more counts, but she did like a different kind of pull and then she claps and then she did a stretch, right? So again, I would have liked for her to finish that movement. It felt like she did the two on one side and then she just decided, I'm going to do something else. And so I think to execute the movement more fully and to really feel that and be in tune with the music, I would have chosen to do it both the right side and the left side and then gone into the stretch and then the clap. Maybe the clap is a four count, going right, left, right, left. Maybe the stretch in the middle is a four count, a right, a left, a right, left. After the two essence pulls to the right and two to the left. So really completing that movement and committing to it and not changing it up before you would really round out the sequence. So, overall, I think that the dancer had pretty good execution in terms of just moving and utilizing steps that I would find familiar in this movement vernacular with social dancing and looking at some Lindy Hop swing dancing. However, again, I could see there was some improvisation happening, and therefore she was thinking about the movement and not just hitting the movement and hitting it clearly with the extension of arms or the feet and things like that. That's something that I would pick up on. So in a context of just in general, just making sure you know where your body is going and what steps that you're executing and being clear of whatever the sequence is. But then, you know, if it is choreographic, then I would speak specific to the choreography being executed or not and hitting certain movements. So, again, the dancer is trying different movements, not really completing them on either side. I noticed that she goes right into a kick very strongly, which is great, but then realizes that if she doesn't slow down, she's going to lose the beat. So I'm seeing that in the movement when she brings the leg down. I've seen this a couple of times. So she'll sustain that. And that is fine, but she could also keep going and add another step in there as well to make sure that she keeps time with the music. So that was another good example as the dancer is reaching and she's looking. Her hands are going to different positions, right? So again, if this were something that was choreographed or that was a specific step, then she's reaching right and she's reaching left. She's reaching right, she's left, but she's still going to the same place. I feel like she's going in different levels with her arms in the spaces she's turning. So you're not really sure where she's going with those spaces. And then if this is a dance, dancing that she's doing with a partner, it's very difficult for me to see if she's leading or following or if she is dancing solo, right? So if say she's following, where would the hands be or the steps be as if it were a puzzle on the other side of her, this other person dancing, where would that person be fitting into the things that she's doing as she's moving about? So I'm not exactly sure if I'm describing this correctly in terms of what I'm assessing and seeing and analyzing in terms of me not being sure. Like I need more context, right? Is this something she'd be doing with someone? Is this a stylized jazz dance? Is this social dancing, something that's like the Lindy Hop or the Big Apple? Are we looking at specific steps and executing steps or just how she's executing movement? Because to me, these are not specific. These are specific steps as in I could see a step ball change or I can see a kickball change, a shuffle. I can see steps in that way, but with the phrasing and the sequencing, the steps are quite short. It's hard to see what the phrasing is or what is being communicated with the phrasing, if I'm saying this clearly enough, with some of the steps. I also think she could do steps a little longer so that we can really identify what it is that she's doing or she's saying with the body, with the steps. She's changing a bit. So it's kind of hard again to see what the phrasing is and where it begins and where it ends. And that doesn't always shift with the movement changes because a phrase can change movements, but it's really also about how it fits with the music. Okay, so this was a good example. I think she did the step where she was swinging her arms right and left, then she steps forward. She's still coming down a diagonal going towards the left, down diagonal towards the viewer. And then she kind of brings out the arms from the chest and opens and she does it twice. And then she goes backwards and she does the movement again versus stepping on the left to do the same movement on the left, which would have taken up the same four counts, but she changed the movement, which again, she's bringing in different movements and variations, but not really completing it on one side from the next, which would I think even out the movement a bit better. And it would also just take up the steps and the counts because when you have a four, four, you're counting usually eight counts, a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So if you do the first four going to the right, one, two, three, four, you can do that movement on the left side of five, six, seven, eight, or do something else. That's a five, six, seven, eight. But what I'm finding is she might go into a five, six, seven and step into an eight to do the next movement instead of on the one. And so that's where I'm saying that she could balance that a little bit better. I could probably show you what I'm saying more clearly. So doing my best to try to verbally describe what I'm seeing, but that is how I would suggest for the dancer to execute that movement. Furthermore, if the dancer is clear about where they're going, the movement is done more fuller out, it's done with more confidence and more energy and less inhibition or apprehension. Thank you. The dancer is doing great with adding her head, with the movement where she's doing the two-step and adding the arms to sway. When she starts to do the quarter turns and what looks to be a kickball change or stepball change, it was really the first two were more alike. And then the third one, she did like a harder stop. And then the fourth one went back to the first two. Usually if you're doing a movement like that, you're doing the same movement on all four sides in a quarter turn. So I would have liked to see that just to make sure that it's very clear, all the steps. And then one might go back the other direction to round that out. She's turning quite a bit on the right side here. Even though the third step was a harder step, it also was differentiated from the other two steps by what looked like a shuffle almost. Like again, going into maybe a tap movement, like a shuffle ball change. Whereas in jazz, you might have a step ball change. A shuffle would be creating that sound that we heard there. Another example here that I'm referring to is what I would refer to as an essence pull, where she brings both of the arms out. Usually you want to pull in the hip to the right or to the left, whichever direction you're going, and you want to move right or left with the feet, the legs. She's moving somewhat back on a diagonal and kind of making it a slide, and that's fine. Again, it's hard to say, okay, is that a specific step or is that movement? So if I'm looking at this and saying, if you want to achieve an essence pull in this sequence and that's choreographic or that's where we want to place that, my direction would be to fully step out on the right and stretch the right arm over the top of the head, over to the left side of the body, and really lean into that to the right, and then do the same thing on the left. Even if you're doing those double time steps that she's doing, right, right, and left, because she's going back, it's hard to see, okay, is it that essence pull that I think it is, or is this something different? And then if it is something different, and I do appreciate how she did it both on the right side and the left side, then what is that? Maybe it's supposed to be going in that diagonal because that is a step that she's created or that's a movement and that's fine, but not really identifying the exact step that that person is doing, that this dancer is doing, it's a little difficult to say, is that person doing it correctly? I would just say, again, all the movement needs to be fuller, fully extended and fuller on the top part of the body, just as much as you're doing the steps with the feet, really stretching the arms and releasing in the chest and holding the head up and those types of things would be some of my corrections and tips if I'm looking to help guide somebody through a sequence that looks like that, because you want to see confidence, you want to see the joy, you want to see that somebody's having a good time. You want to, again, going to this African aesthetic and these canons, there's a certain level of confidence and vibrato, if you will, there's a certain approach to the movement at any level that shows that you're really enjoying yourself, right? Because if this is social dance and this is cultural, then this is really about expressing oneself and in a heightened state of joy or excitement. A lot of these dances come out of resilience and beauty and connection and community. That's what we want to see in the body with those movements and being very intentional and clear again, because if you're dancing with somebody, that other person needs to know where you're going in space and be able to anticipate that as well. Another example of this is it's not very clear if the dancer is pushing her arms out, stretching her arms out into like both being fully extended to create a T, or she's just kind of moving through the space. So again, we want to be intentional with the way that we're directing our movement. So if you're extending your arms, it should be a full extension and everything should be straight from the fingertips all the way across to the other fingertips, right? So no bends in the elbows and being very direct versus having a bend in the elbow and also just the direction of the hands. If you're stretching out, is the path that you're pushing the air and then dropping the hands? Are you extending it fully? So that's what I just mean by the commitment is just trying to understand where she's really going with her hands and her arms. Her feet definitely seem to be more clear, but directionally and with the energy, I want to see the effort being more intentional and direct and her just being aware of, okay, where am I placing my arms? If this was choreography, where would those arms go? To me again, she's improvising. So she's just kind of moving her arms in a direction to sway along with the feet, but she's going to make the movement, make it with intention and make it very clear. Another example is the reaching out in the quarter turn. So the dancer begins to reach out just with her right arm, bringing her arm back in, bending her elbow. And then when she gets to maybe the third one, she adds the other arm. And it wasn't clear in the first two if her arm was really fully out there or she was thinking about it. And so it turned into both arms. So maybe because it was a quarter turn, in my mind, I would like to see both of those arms going out in each of those quarters turn steps, really facing each of the corners or the quarter, if you think about a pie or a clock, and just being intentional with the movement as she turned around in that circle. Dancers begins with moving her shoulders and catching the rhythm of the music. And then she steps out to, I believe it is the left. And then I saw a little bit of a, I don't know if it was apprehension on the movement or a thought to go in a different direction, but the direction she went. So I did see a little, it's not really a mistake, but it's more that she was thinking to do something, but she went in a different direction or did a different step, which is what I am seeing. Again, there is the improvisation. The dancer is trying out the different movements and executing on the steps. It does, in some aspects, I would say a tip would really be to just the dancer to be very clear about where they're going and what the movement is that they're executing so that it doesn't seem like they're thinking about it or holding back. That's what's coming through a little bit there. Then also, it seems at this point, the dancer is anticipating the music ending. There are moments where I notice the dancer probably could have finished. They strike the pose and then realize, oh, I need to keep going, which is fine, just saying that I picked up on that. What's helpful is to, again, it was nice the dancer was listening to the music in the beginning, but just have an idea about where the music is ending if you're improvising or what that can look like, or even having a transitional step in there. Again, because this isn't choreography to me from what I see from my experience. If it should be choreography, then it's easy for me to say, okay, this step is not accurate because this is the choreography or this is the specific step. The dancer is moving and improvising, so some of it is subjective in the sense that, okay, this is the dancer's choice to do this or to do that. However, my perspective is that when they are doing some of these movements that they're improvising, they do need to be more intentional and stronger in their movement, more convicted, more committed to carrying the movement out so that it is clear and that it does not seem that the dancer is unsure about the movement. Overall, though, I do think that the dancer knows how to move their body, they know how to execute steps, and they know how to incorporate their body and be rhythmic with the music and the movement. Another step, a point here along the same lines, and pointing this out because it shows how it does impact the movement, is just the twist from the dancer. It's not clear where her feet are stepping. She is sort of moving both right and left, and so she has great groove, and she's listening to the music and it's rhythmic, but hard to see where her feet should be, right? When she's just kind of moving in the space. Because even when you're improvising, even when you're dancing by yourself, you know where your body is going, you know where your feet might be going in the space. I think about some other dance forms that do include improvisation, that maybe like folkloric dances, for example, even though there's improvisation there, it's still being done within a structure. So when she's doing this shift here, this twist, what is the structure? She could have still had her feet in the same placement and been in the center, and she's just rotating her knees from side to side and her hips in opposition, but she's keeping her feet in the same place. So we're very clear about where she is in the space versus her feet picking up and being in different places as they land. It doesn't seem as organized in the body or in the space, even though the movement can still be executed. And so maybe that was the goal for that kind of step. And then I would just say, keep the feet together, parallel, right underneath the hips, twisting and rotating so that it's clear what the dancer is doing. Another example of that is just even on the hand claps, right? So I think that those hand claps could be stronger. The arms could have been held more taut. The elbows could have been at a stronger angle. I felt like it was a little bit of a, for lack of a better word, it was a weaker clap, as in it wasn't done with as much strength or force to bring our hands really together. And a lot of times with movement, when you have accents, right, where you can stomp. And she did a really good stomp in the quarter turns on that third turn. But even in the claps, just being very intentional and using some strength behind that movement. And again, it could just have been because she wasn't sure if that's where she wanted to go. Or she did do that, and she was thinking more about her feet. And so we want to have that same energy throughout the whole body to mirror what the top is doing with the bottom, particularly in this kind of movement. Again, that is based in African aesthetic, even though you're doing isolated movements, right? So you're moving those hands independently of the feet. They can still be on the same beat, but you still want it to be strong and carry the same energy throughout the body simultaneously. The dancer has great execution with the movement. She's lifting the knees high, she's kicking. So that's very clear with the steps. I can tell because she's not doing the steps on both sides of the body that she might be thinking about doing the next thing and then kind of jumping right into it before she finishes a sequence. So she's gonna do a kickball change on the right. And that's like a four count. She's going into another movement that might have a three count versus a four count. She could have repeated the movement on that other side to complete the roundness of the movement. And also I noticed she stepped to turn on a right side or a left side when again, that I would have sequentially just thought for her to move, to finish a step or sequence that she started. She's keeping the rhythm very well and being clear with the steps. But again, for me, I can see that she's improvising. It's a bit evident that she's doing that and thinking about what to do next and executing on it. But she's kind of will do this step, I'll say once and then again. And the second time seems a little bit clearer because maybe she feels like, okay, this is what I'm gonna be doing. And I feel a little bit more confident in that movement. The dancer is doing great. This is a nice two-step here. She's adding snaps and swaying the arms. The arms are not executing the same, going to the same place as they swing right to left to their height or to their high point, but she is swinging at the same time. So I could tell like when she started to do it, she thought about doing it and then as she started to continue or she as she continued, she started to kind of get her groove with it and then felt a little bit more carefree with it and confident. And then I can see her hands swaying in the visual from the egocentric view there. I do like how the dancer is coordinating the top half of her body with the bottom half, which does help one to keep the rhythm and show interconnectedness between the top and the bottom part of the body and to keep step.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Here you can see that he has a black pepper grinder and he is going to grind that directly into his salad. I always recommend using a measuring spoon when seasoning a salad so that you know exactly how much seasoning you're adding to the finished dish. He eyeballs about a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar and pours that directly into the mixing bowl. This is the acid that he's using in this dish, which is a key component to a cucumber and tomato salad. However, again, I would like to see him use a measuring spoon or a liquid measuring cup to determine how much to add. A tablespoon or two is adequate for a salad of this size. It's here that you can see that he has like just very average knife skills Outside of the fact that he's seated which is a very awkward position to be Executing these tasks. He doesn't seem very comfortable with the knife and he doesn't seem like he has any Rama reason or technique To what he's doing It's just very random He is grabbing each tomato, it looks like a grape tomato, out of this container here one by one and cutting it in half crosswise. He continues this motion over and over and over again until he has his onions chopped or minced to his liking. Here you can see that once all of his vegetables are cut, he moves them by hand in batches from the cutting board to this mixing bowl. He actually would be better served by holding the bowl underneath the table here and dragging all of the vegetables directly from the cutting board down into the mixing bowl. It would be much more efficient that way. Then he slices it into half-inch thick slices and then proceeds to do the same technique as he did with the onions which is holding the tip of the knife down on the cutting board with his left hand and moving the knife up and down in a backwards and forwards motion across all of the cucumbers that are that are sliced. After cutting off about a half inch thick tip from this cucumber section, he cuts it in half lengthwise. The first step to making a cucumber and tomato salad is to gather all of your ingredients that you will need for the recipe and to set up your workspace. You can see here that he has a cutting board and a chef's knife here in front of him. He is sitting in a chair which is never recommended when you're cutting anything. You need to be standing up on flat feet at a workspace that's at an adequate level for your height. However, he does have his ingredients handy. He has some pre-sliced red onion here that he is grabbing from a bowl and transferring to the cutting board in batches. His last step is tossing all of the ingredients to combine, which he is doing here with a metal spoon. This is an appropriate tool selection for this task. Here you can see that he is adding a pinch of salt, which I assume to be about an eighth of a teaspoon, which would be a sufficient amount of salt for this recipe. However, again, I would like to see him use a measuring spoon to execute this task. He cuts off about a three inch section of a small baby cucumber and sets the balance aside for another time. Once his onions are chopped to his liking, he groups them on one section of the cutting board here. He should probably at this point have transferred the onions to his mixing bowl so that he would have adequate room to work on the next vegetable, which is his tomatoes. Holding the knife down with his left hand here, he holds the tip of the knife down on the cutting board and with his right hand he moves in an up-and-down motion across the surface of the cutting board. Obviously all of the onions are underneath the knife and are getting diced. This is actually a reasonable way to dice onions if your onion starts from a pre-sliced state.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

Here she's moving backwards in space with her right leg and she's leading with her toe first. This is helping her remain mobile. The dancer should make sure her focus remains forward for the entirety of the dance routine, even if she's reaching towards the end here, instead of looking downward at the floor in her hand. On this box step the dancer could be covering a lot more ground. She kind of stays in the same vicinity But this is a traveling step so she really could travel far over to her right and back around To just cover a greater portion of the studios and she has a space available to her that would make her dancing more exciting Again, every dance step the dancer is doing is leading on her toe first. So this is why she's able to cross over, cross behind, and come back around in the direction that she is doing easily with her heels off the ground. The dancer keeps her weight on her toe when she turns. Her heel is in the air and that's helping her be able to get around on the floor without any friction. The dancer tilts her chin a bit down here and lowers her gaze slightly. We see more of the floor in her ego view. She should make sure that she keeps her eyes straight level in front of her, especially since she's about to turn. She doesn't want to do any head movements like tilting her chin downward because that can make her more dizzy and also throw her off balance. The dancer can improve this movement by changing her focus to be looking in the direction in which she's extending her arm. So because she's extending her arm to the left, she should also be looking to the left. The dancer is inconsistent with her focus. When she walked to the right side of the room, she was looking to the right, but now as she walks the left side of the room, she's looking forward. So she should just be consistent. Either would be fine, but it doesn't seem like she's very much so concentrating on her focus, which she should be. These basic dance steps, the dancer could also travel more as well. She could be traveling further forward to the center than further backwards just to make her dance more exciting especially because she's a dancer who has long limbs. She has long arms and legs so she really should be using those to her advantage since they're a resource for her. The dancer does a great job of distributing her weight on her toes when she's sliding out to the side Her weight is on the toes.

It's a really great tone that he's getting from the low strings, but their resonance is overpowering the higher strings. So we just need the higher strings to be a little bit louder, just for the balance of this ringing chord. We can hear that the guitarist is making really great contact with his thumb in the right hand, the nail of the thumb on the string, which is why we hear that nice really resonant low strings when he plucks them. However, we do hear a bit of nail sound on the high E string, so the correct way to get a tone without nail sound would be to just get more of the nail underneath the string. We're hearing a buzzing coming from the high E string played with middle finger. That's because not enough of the nail is on the string and so when it was plucked we heard that buzzing against the nail. So ideally more nail on the string. That was a really great example of beautiful warm resonant tone on the guitar. So that's kind of exactly what a good mezzo forte guitar tone should sound like. This is an excellent example of a very balanced left hand and great left hand position. We can see that each finger is perpendicular to the strings and that the thumb is pretty much right behind the middle finger and that nothing except the fingers, no part of the hand except the fingers, is touching the neck. This is a great example of left hand technique on the guitar. We heard a buzzing sound come out of the high E string, and that is because as we can see, his fourth finger on his left hand is just slightly off-center and tilted downwards, and so when the string was plucked and vibrated, it hit up against his fourth finger, his pinky finger, and his left hand and caused that buzz sound. So there's a little bit more curvature of the pinky finger and making sure they were dead center on the string when holding it down will make it so that our finger is not in the way of any other vibrating string. This is a really great example of the motion with which the fingers in the right hand should pluck the string. We can see that every time the guitarist plucks the string, his finger is coming backwards into the hand, not being plucked up. And so this slight curve of the wrist and where he has the guitar positioned on his arm allows his hand to hang over the strings, and then he can pluck just inwards toward his hand instead of having to pluck up. So it's pretty much perfect right hand technique. It's a really great example of correct finger placement and correct technique with the fingers on guitar. We can see that on all fingers touching the fingerboard, it is the tip of the finger that is pressing down the string. And that's what's giving him such great mobility around the instrument as well as great clarity of note.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So here the feet are pretty parallel Which means the hips are staying in the pelvis is staying intact. The hips are staying intact with each other So she's pivoting more on the balls of her feet, which is exactly how we want to do a turn She's done a good job of swinging the arms down and up in an arc shape while keeping the elbows nice and straight Which is really good. She does also appear to be spotting her head It looks like her gaze is kind of more in this direction, which is good Even though her body is facing this direction So that means she's keeping her head facing where she came from as long as she can hopefully which is good spotting technique This is a better recovery from the second turn. So the first turn after she finished, she really kind of let her arms drop, which really detracted from the beauty of the turn. In this case, she's keeping a little bit more strength through the arms, a little bit more clarity through the arms, which really helps. So here she's starting a turn over her left shoulder on her left leg and is bringing the right arm, right leg up or about to bring the right leg up. She's preparing to do that and I think she does a good job here because she's got a nice straight knee and a plantar flexion through the foot so that's creating a line here that hopefully is, not hopefully, but is setting us up for the idea that there might be an arc in the air with that leg. So this is something else this dancer needs to work on. So one thing to work on is attack. Another thing is the mechanics of lifting the arms and keeping a little bit more looseness through here, a little bit more looseness through the knees. But another thing is transitions. So she just did this really actually very well executed turn, but my issue is that in this recovery from the turn, she completely loses her arms. She just drops her arms down. So that really detracts from the beauty of that turn that she just did. So it's really important to continue dancing through all the transitions and making the transitions just as important as the big things like the turns. This is a good preparation with the arms. She's a beat before she's about to do something new. She's prepped with the arms. The arm prep also looks really strong and clear because it's just this nice cross in front of her body. Again, I really think this dancer needs to work on attack because she did this basic step to turn to come towards her left and then turn her facing towards her right and is now making her way back toward the right. And this arm came up really, really, really slowly and only just now at the end of that step. I think she probably forgot that she was supposed to raise her arm up and so has brought it up here at the last moment and is now bringing it across her body. But because she's bringing it up so slowly, again, she really needs more attack. This choreography is very shapey and very sharp looking and she's missing that texture and that dynamic. Here she does a better job of stepping further away from her body. Well let me back up. She's basically repeating the same step she did to her left. She's now doing it to the right where she steps out with one foot and drags the rest of the body behind her. She did a better job in this repetition of stepping a bit further from her body. I would have liked to see her get onto a plie here and really get her weight all the way on that foot so that the rest of her body can really drag behind her. She does a better job with this arm coming up a little bit higher here but again she's not attacking the moment enough and so because she doesn't attack that very first millisecond of the beat she runs out of music to complete this fully and that means that the arm doesn't ever fully make a shape. It doesn't fully get to where it's got a where it could go before she has to move on to the next moment in order to stay on the music if that makes sense. Here's another transition moment that is a quite stiff, awkward, and jerky. She just sort of steps forward with this right foot and is sort of just standing here. She's not really moving through the transition. Another reason that it looks awkward and jerky, as you can see, she's stepped onto a very straight knee and that's just by nature of physics going to create a reverberation, which makes it look jerky. So I would say finding a way to continue moving through this transition, whether that's coming into the transition more slowly or doing something with the arms as she steps through with her foot and also step with a soft knee. Really good job with these arms. She brought them to prepare in front of her body kind of crossed over each other and has Done a really good job of flinging them down and back and up into an into an arc shape There's a lot of energy coming out the fingertips which we can see here also nice Height with the L shoulder and straight elbow. So this is really good arm shapes here The turn prep so she's about to do a turn It does look like she's considering the hip as her pivot point rather than the ball of the foot Slightly because the hips are turned in towards each other slightly. So we're gonna keep watching and see if that's true So a little bit of stiffness here, especially, well actually I was gonna say especially to the upper body, but actually the lower body too. You can see that this knee is barely in a plie, this one is very straight. So that's part of why this looks a little awkward and stiff in general for her. She needs to loosen through the knees a bit more and allow them to give her some cushion and some spring. Also very, very stiff through the shoulders, the neck, and the upper back. You can see that as she's lifting this arm, it's very hard to really see, but I can I can barely see here that she's lifting using her upper trapezius to get that shoulder up, when really what would be better is if the shoulder stayed neutral and she moved in a more front and back way with the shoulder rather than up and down. So that's another reason this looks really stiff and it looks kind of clunky. She's not very, she's just not moving very smoothly and this particular step is meant to look very smooth, very elegant. Also another reason it looks stiff by the way is because she's not using her hips very well and the reason that she can't really isolate through the pelvis is because she's too stiff through the knees. Once the knees release, usually the pelvis can release and move side to side a bit more smoothly. So she's done a great job with this leg because she had a nice straight knee. She brought a little bit from behind, arced it up, and then bent it when it's really high in the air. And it looks really good partly because she's plantar flexing through the foot rather than just letting the foot dangle. So it helps to emphasize that line and also helps to emphasize this angle. I think she brought the knee up a little too high for her flexibility. I can see you can see that because she's had to bend through her standing leg, which is typically a sign that there's some inflexibility through the hamstrings, at least enough for her to bring the knee this high. So I'd recommend she find a way to... I would just have her bring the knee down just a slight bit here so that this can be a nice straight knee. I wish that something different was happening with the arms here. Unclear what's meant to happen with the arms, but because this is such an unusual step for this choreography so far, there's never been a step like this yet in the choreography, it'd be really nice to see something interesting with the upper body. I don't know if that was the choreographer, if that's on the choreographer, if that's on this dancer, but certainly would like to see something a bit more interesting with those arms. Just pointing out again that she makes this shape almost exactly the same way as before very similar facing looks really really strong This is one of the better shapes that she makes. So this attack here that she's doing with this shape I would want I would encourage her to find ways to attack other shapes in the set in the choreography So the shape is really nice because she's got a I don't actually know if her elbows straight but based on the position of her hand most likely a straight elbow here, which is creating a line from the fingertips to the toes and that line is also Assisted by the fact that this is a nice straight knee and the toes are on the floor really really nice and that's contrasted with This arm coming across the front of her body It's a really beautiful twist and a great plie through this leg while looking out towards the audience This is a really really good moment. It's very sharp She attacks it so that she has time to hold the shape before dropping it so she can go to the next thing musically And because she holds it for just a millisecond it gives the viewer the impression that oh, that's a shape and something to look at It's also quite unexpected because there's not been another big shape like this in the choreography And so it's really important to emphasize that as a dancer. So really really good moment here So this is pretty graceful with the wrist and fingers here, which is what I wanted to point out. She's also quite clear with this shape here with the other arm. So this is another example of where I'd love to see her attack a little bit more. So this arm looks really good and strong. This one looks pretty weak here. So I would actually recommend that she attack this and get the arm straight in front of her with this movement because what's happening is she's coming up relatively slowly in this sort of legato way and then bringing this arm up into this. It's actually it's a nice looking shape. It's very graceful but it really doesn't fit with the step because this is a very quick step with these feet and this one's coming forward and what's I think meant to happen is that it's supposed to be mirrored with a quick movement forward with the opposite arm. So she's really kind of missing that which makes this this section look a little bit again weak. She's doing a good job with the hip movement though with this step which I think is the point of the step. So maybe the arm is just not as important but it's certainly as the hips but would add just a little bit more interest to the movement if she could get that arm quickly up there with an attack just as quickly as she's bringing the foot out and get that arm nice and straight with energy out the fingertips there. So I know the dancer is just waiting for her musical cue here, but I still want to critique this moment because she's standing in, she's just standing there and that's a problem, especially when doing a type of dance that is very highly correlated with the music. My recommendation is that she put the beat in her body somehow. Well, actually there's two different options. One, put the beat in her body somehow. So bounce her knees, tap her foot, move her arms a little bit, snap her fingers, something so that she can really get that, put that music into her body before she even starts dancing. That's option one. Option two is be in some sort of a very specific pose that lends itself to the style of choreography or lends itself to preparation for the first step that she's going to do. This position she's standing in is not helping her to start strongly once the musical cue hits. So here she just completed a second repetition of the turn. Again I'm not going to go through every single moment of that second turn just to say that she was very consistent with both turns and has really good turn technique. Great, she's got good really good turn technique So she did a good job of transferring her weight onto the right foot But you can see that there's a tiny shadow between the heel on the floor or tiny space between the heel on the floor Which means she's turning on the ball of her foot, which I want to see every time with turns Also great job spotting her head She's whipped her head around and is bringing it or is Continuing currently whipping her head around to bring it back to face downstage You can see that her gaze is already towards downstage even though her body is still facing stage left Which is great spotting technique. The arms also look really nice and strong in this shape here. So overall really great turn So here she's doing a rib isolation in a circle and is doing her arms in the sort of opposite circle. This again looks really stiff. She's got her shoulders really close to her ears. She is doing a circle here with the ribs, but it's not very well isolated. So again, I'd like to see her work on more flexibility and articulation through the spine would help this look less awkward and less stiff. So this is how I can tell that the previous step she did not do correctly. I can tell that she forgot to raise her left arm when she was going in this direction, because as she's stepping here, she's already bringing the right arm up. So this is a demonstration of she forgot what she was supposed to do. That's OK. It happens. My issue is that then it's very obvious that she didn't do it right, because she repeats it and does it differently this time. So I would recommend that she repeat her mistake and make it look like, because that would make it look like she was meant to do it that way. I do like that she's got energy out her fingertips here, a nice straight elbow to start this movement. However, again, there's not enough attack. I would really like to see this arm get up to shoulder height right away, because that, again, lends itself to this style of dance and this choreography. Because what's going to happen is as she brings this arm across, she's going to run out of music again. So I don't think this arm will ever get up to shoulder height in time. I think it's going to look very small and weak, and it'll be more like an arc like this. So to prepare herself better for this, I would like to see this attack happen, with the arm coming all the way to shoulder height before coming across her body. Again, just pointing out that her lack of attack is making it so that this movement is kind of weak looking. The first time that she did this, with the opposite arm, it was more like this shape, and now she's almost got a straight elbow here, but an almost straight elbow makes it look unintentional and again weak. So I would recommend really again, attack and get this up right away. That would just add so much more interest to the step. You can also see a little bit of stiffness through the upper spine here, so that's something she also needs to work on. Good job with this basic step and turning her body, her facing here. Also, she's alternating her arms in a way that's appropriate for this step. Pretty good ending of that turn. She was able to get all the way around, get her weight on that back foot and the right toe forward, the opposite toe forward, which looks really nice. And she also stopped with the arms up in the air right on the beat. So that was really good ending to the turn here. This is an example of her making a really good shape and attacking the movement. So again, encouraging her to find ways to do that throughout. So here she's done a salsa step one, two, and then on the three she steps away from her body with her left foot. Lots of things are not good about this. So first thing is her step away from her body is very small. Smallness can be helpful to make movements more quick, but in this case this step would be so much more interesting if she really took a risk and stepped really far out from her body, even leapt onto that foot slightly, to drag the rest of her body behind. That would just make this shape so much more interesting. The arms here are very weak. There's no clarity of the shape here. I can see that she's using her shoulder to lift her arm, her trapezius to lift her arm up, which is not good technique. It's gonna make it look stiff and awkward. Neither of her arms are really in any clear shape here, so she's missing a lot of opportunities for interest here. Also and part of the reason that's happening is because she's stepping into this way too slowly. She's not attacking this moment and so that's making it so that she doesn't have enough music to fully make the shape because she didn't bring the arms up quickly enough. And that's partly why she never actually gets into a shape and it looks really kind of weak.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He's got this pelvis really Jutted out to the side and this knee turned in on the same leg Which is creating this contradictory flow of movement in his lower body Which is keeping him from moving efficiently and connecting to the rhythm And that's really stemming from the movement of this pelvis if you were to minimize the movement of the pelvis you'd be able to move the lower body more quickly and efficiently and Also be able to find some more clarity in the upper body As the dancer starts by beginning some basic step touches and movements around himself, he's getting thrown off the rhythm almost immediately, particularly through this kind of extraneous movement in his upper body, where his head, his shoulders, his arms, down his spine, and even his pelvis are moving in quite a significant way that's really disconnected from the rhythm. So he would overall benefit from some refinement and some clarity in the use of the upper body. However, in his lower body, he's also maintaining quite disconnect, a lot of disconnection from the rhythm. He's taking very large steps, which you can see his foot elevated quite significantly off the ground here, and bending his knees a little bit too deeply for what the movement would call for, which is overall making his movements appear slow and quite jumbled in relation to the rhythm. As the dancer continues to turn around himself, he's kind of disconnecting from the movement vocabulary of salsa here. He's really turning around himself in more of a freestyle way, disconnecting his feet from one another. He's got this really significant turnout in both feet and this significant bend in both of his knees which is causing him to move slowly as he turns around himself rather than quickly and efficiently. He also continues to have a lack of clarity in his arms and his upper body which you can see here is kind of twisting off of his pelvis, particularly his head which is floating above the upper body in a way that's completely disconnected from the rhythm of the music. As the dancer incorporates some basic arm choreography, alternating holding his arm up above his head, he could use some refinement in the shape of both his arm as well as his hand, which is kind of overall lacking some clarity. He would also benefit from some rhythmic clarity here. He seems to be holding the arm above his head and moving it down to alternate arms without any sort of real rhythmic embodiment or connection to the music. You can also see his shoulders are appearing quite stiff as he's doing this movement, which is minimizing his upper body's ability and his spine's ability to connect to the rhythm and connect to the lower body in general.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You can start to see the beginning of the right knee to raise up. Two hands go on the ball to give better control and support as this person prepares to release the shot. His eyes and head is up, eyeing the target. I would like to see a little bit more aggression here in this shot. He's just kind of flipping it up there. I love the extension of the arm to release the ball high on the backboard. It has a good chance of going in. I would love this offhand to be a little bit up higher to kind of hold off the defense when there is defense, but beautiful extension here of the elbow. I would love to see a little bit more elevation here on the shot. Again, good footwork here, two hands go on the ball, eyes and head are on the target. I would love to see him square his shoulders up, that left shoulder square, but maybe bring the right shoulder around a little bit. He's kind of shooting like a hook shot, which is not as very as accurate if you were to square your shoulders, get that shooting hand behind the ball. But I love the fact that he's aiming for the top of that square right in there, has a good chance of going in. Again, eyes are on target, great extension of the arm and elbow, following the ball up to the basket. Love the elevation here on the shot. In this particular frame, with the one dribble move to do the reverse layup, I'd love to see this off hand be up a little bit more to add some protection to the ball. In a game situation, you don't want that off hand down. You want it up more, ready to catch the ball and to go into your shot. He's a little upright. I'd love to see him bent down, knees bent a little bit more. Here, good extension on the shot. He may come down a little bit too under the basket. You'd like for him to kind of be out in here a little bit, but this ball has a really good chance of going in. Nice rotation up to the top of that square on the backboard. Again, good elevation here, leaving to go up and shoot the shot. Eyes are on the target, which is really good. A great look here of extension of the arm and elbow, the release of the basketball to the top of the square. Good use of the dribble to get in this position to the rim. Nice big step here. One, two step. I love how he puts the ball in two hands to prepare for the shot. Good spatial spacing here on relationship of your body to the basket.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here the player has demonstrated a high degree of proficiency when he accidentally hit the ball a little bit too far behind him. Rather than panic or lunge, he manages to contort his body which takes some flexibility. And if you see here, he still has a locked ankle with the heel down and the toe up, which leads to a perfect recovery touch and then he gets back into his rhythm. Being able to quickly adjust your body and maintain flexibility but still maintain proper striking surfaces is a key to good juggling. Not only did he reach back but he maintained a heel toe relationship that was locked in order to quickly get control of the ball. The player also is showing a high degree of skill. Not only are they maintaining balance, but they're using different strike surfaces of both feet. Using both feet rather than just your dominant foot is another sign of proficiency in through juggling and will help you get better at the actual act. He's used the inside, the laces, and here consecutively he's using the outside of his foot. He still maintains proper striking form in the sense that his ankle is locked, his toe is up, which gives the ball a strong surface to go up on. You can see as he's juggling there's almost no spin on it and he maintains the exact same touch multiple times showing the consistency we're looking for when you're learning to juggle at a higher level. The player also demonstrates the ideal control for the ball, which is especially when using the feet below waist height or at times even below knee height. If he's not doing that, the ball still maintains relatively close between around his head height or around shin height where you'd want the ball in order to keep it up. At times players might mess with greater heights, but the ideal height for striking with the feet is below the waist, which he does with ease unless he's changing to a different surface, such as his thighs. Again, and it's extremely important to note in terms of his skill is that he's developed both foot. One footed juggling is a detriment in the long term and makes the actual act itself harder. Demonstrating or practicing proficiency in both feet will help you with balance and help you to be able to juggle longer for extended periods of time. He's worked on both touches, both surfaces, and you can see he's comfortable with both his left and right and multiple surfaces. Also, he's shown that he's comfortable using his thigh, chest, and even shoulder and head while juggling, which is important for the entire act in and of itself. You'll also notice with many of his touches, the ball has minimal spin or very little spin. At times, having some backspin or slight spin on the ball is okay, especially if you're doing it on purpose, but a sign of a pure touch is that the spin is minimal and it's not changing or moving the direction of the ball. Many early jugglers make the mistake of having too much backspin, which moves the ball into your body. Here, he's shown a high level of proficiency and control in the ball and not spinning it in any direction, which helps him maintain his control. Here the player is going through the act or the skill of juggling which is keeping the ball off the ground using all soccer allowed surfaces that excludes the arms and hands. The objective is to get touches while maintaining control of the ball without letting it hit the ground. The player is doing an excellent job of when they do change surfaces or hit the ball higher or farther out, quickly adjusting their body so they're back in balance and back to the same steady rhythm or relatively the same height use of the ball, which is head to shin. They're doing a good job of getting the same cadence as soon as they regain control. Here the player has adjusted his body very quickly. Rather than lean or stick out a leg or fall over, he moves with the ball so he maintains his own balance and regains control. If you ever lose control of a ball, regaining your own balance as quickly as you can and moving with the ball rather than lunging for it will help maintain control for better juggling. Another sign, as you saw from just now in the video, is that he maintains a consistent rhythm on the ball. You saw when he briefly lost some control, he quickly got hold of the ball and then got back into his rhythm, showing that he'd regained complete control. When working on juggling, a steady rhythm shows a superior level of touch and proficiency in terms of actually using striking surfaces. Immediately you can see from his balance that he's very in control of the ball. One of the key things to juggling is maintaining your own balance so that rather than you being off balance and constantly needed to readjust, you're in proper balance and can focus on how you're striking the ball. Here you can see he has good posture, a good relationship between his knee or his hip and his knee and his foot which allows him to focus again on how he's moving the striking surface of his foot rather than if the ball was all over the place or if he was off balance and leaning, chasing after the ball. Balance is one of the key indicators of you being able to successfully juggle versus you being able to constantly have to chase or dropping the ball.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here the player makes contact and doesn't really move forward, so we limit the control and accuracy we really have. And we can see the non-kicking foot is still pretty much rooted through the ground, so a lot of the control and the accuracy and the power is all generated by the right leg in the contact point with the ball, not really utilising the body for that additional element of the technique. Again, look at the non-kicking foot position where the toe is. Again, we're making contact with the ball in front of that line, so we're going to naturally be hitting the ball when our leg is moving forward. Hit the ball on an upward trajectory, it's going to limit the control of power. Also, obviously, this is our body leaning back and away, so that's going to affect, again, elements of the technique. So we want to make sure that we're making contact with the ball when it's in that number 10 shape where the non-kicking foot is, stroke the ball when the left leg is more vertical to the ground alongside the ball, bending this right knee, getting our hips forward, chest leaning slightly forward, and moving forward in the line of the pass. Again we can see obviously the direction of the ball coming in, playing the non-kicking foot again well behind the line of the ball so now we're reaching forward and also obviously the distance between the non-kicking foot and where the ball is travelling to leads us to now bringing this left leg pointing in, heel up, toe down, making contact close to the heel so that's going to affect the control and the power of the pass. And obviously we also have the body leaning back and away more towards the left side so based on the angle of the foot the body is not being fully utilised for the contact and for the next follow through action. I'm just looking at the contact point with the ball, so I'm making contact with the ball in front of the standing foot. Generally, we can see that by the position of the toe, the direction of the foot and where the ball is made contact with, so we can see it's well in front. We can see, again, the right leg, the leg turning inside, which is naturally going to lead to this foot position B, where the toe is pointing down, the heel is up. We want to be making contact with the lower leg, slightly straight and more vertical to the ground. Heel down, toe up, lock that ankle, really striking through the middle of the ball. Here again, it looks like we've made contact with the ball closer to the heel, stroke ankle area, which is going to lead to less control over the ball due to the nature of the curved surface and the harder surface. We can also see as the player is angling his foot to play the pass back towards the player, the body position, again, is still pointing slightly to the right. We want to try and make sure on contact and follow through that our body is aligned and moving through the line of the pass. And just looking at the contact point with the ball, we want to make contact ideally when the ball is alongside the standing foot. This just helps with our balance, our control, maximising the follow-through action. So we can see the ball is being made contact with in front of the standing foot. So now we're going to be reaching slightly in front of our body, making contact on the follow-through, which is going to impact the contact point on the ball and the follow-through action in general. The foot position, we see the toe down, heel up. So although we could potentially have a locked ankle position here, we're going to be making contact again closer to the heel, ankle, just because of the direction of the foot or potentially the lower half of the ball, which is going to impact the quality and control of the pass. So on heel down, toe slightly up, ankle locked, strike through the middle of the ball in the direction we want to go. And ideally we want to make contact when the lower leg is going straight down, not turning to the inside, because that's what's going to naturally move the foot into the position it's currently in. And we can also see as the player is striking the ball, the body is leaning backwards and away from the intended direction of the pass. We want to try to bend this right knee, get our hips forward, chest leaning slightly forward, so our body momentum moves through the strike. Just looking at how the player is receiving the ball. So as the ball is obviously travelling in, it's important to be on the balls of our feet, move our body behind the line of the ball so we can make good decisions on the technical selection and surface. So here you'll see the player preparing to strike the ball with the inside of the right foot as the ball is travelling towards his left. But we've already planted his left foot very flat to the ground, straight leg and the ball looks like it's travelling towards that foot. So if we're preparing to use the right foot, it's probably not the right technical selection for the most accurate and clean of passes. We can also see the body, very upright position. I do like the player really maintains strong visual contact on the ball all the way coming through. But we need to really be on the balls of our feet, moving our feet and timing both the selection of the pass that we're looking to make as well as the technical choices. Again, just looking at the follow-through action of the player, so very limited, quite short. It does go in the general direction that he wants the ball to go. We can see the foot opening up a little bit, knee opening up a little bit, hips and chest you can see facing out to the right side with the ball travelling through the centre. So we're not fully aligned. Elements of this come from just being very static and still through that left foot planted to the ground. So we want to be a little bit lighter on our feet, lock that ankle, strike through the line of the ball, keep our body aligned with the direction that the ball wants to travel. Again, just looking on contact with the player, with the outside of the right foot, the left foot throughout the ball, travelling into him, doesn't move, very upright static position, so I want to see a slight knee bend, and be more working on the balls of their feet as the ball's coming in. Again, we can see the player getting his foot in a decent position, toe down to the ground, bringing his knee forward over the ball, so that's going to help in terms of the contact point with the ball, but because we're not moving our left foot or stepping towards the ball, a lot of the work, the control of the player is now done with this action to move the foot towards the ball, rather than utilising the body and the balance to move the ball, and then move after. If we're moving towards the ball, we can get this knee closer to one line of the ball, and get our body moving forward through the line of the pass and into the next available space that we want to go. And again, we can see that again, partly through the body position, very upright, as we're reaching out to play the pass in front of the body, so it's not like an inside foot pass with the outside, we're naturally going to be stepping forwards and making contact, but then the follow-through action is going to be slightly different. The end player preparing to play a pass with the right foot so as the ball is traveling in we want to be on the balls of our feet moving in line with the ball. The player is starting to do better in terms of stepping towards the ball with the left foot and he's coming at a slight angle to the ball which is going to help him step into it and rotate his hips through the pass and then obviously we want to allow that ball to travel alongside the standing foot so we create this number 10 shape. Here you'll see again the toe is pointing really far out towards the right hand side towards the right post or outside and that generally controls the body position into the chest and the hips so the follow-through action is affected by that and the balance of the player can effectively be controlled by that. and it's looking at the contact point with the ball so look at the position of the non-kicking foot where we're making contact with the ball is well in front so now we're going to be reaching for the ball which is naturally going to lead to the player leaning back slightly so we don't have our full body momentum moving forwards and through the line of the pass. It's also going to impact the contact point with the ball so here it looks like the foot's in a slightly better position in terms of being more parallel to the ground but the contact with the ball again is much closer to the heel so it's a much much harder rounded surface than the inside curvature of the foot that we want to make contact with the middle of the ball to improve the quality, the consistency, the accuracy and the power of the pass so we want to make sure we're getting our body in a better position with that non-kicking foot stepping forward so we can make contact with the ball alongside the standing foot and get our body moving forwards through the pass itself. Again, very limited in follow-through action for the player. So the player looks like he keeps his foot relatively locked, but there's little to no follow-through, so we don't get any added control or accuracy, and we don't then use that body momentum to move through the ball and bring the body forward. So it's important that when we make contact, keep our foot in that locked position, follow through in the direction we want the ball to go. Can we then go from this bent knee to a straight leg to maximise the control and power we have. Bend this left knee, bring our hips forward, our chest forward in the line of the ball, not lean back from the line, which is going to risk making the ball travel up, but also affect the contact point of the ball due to our balance. Player preparing to play a pass with the inside of the right foot with the ball travelling towards him. Key things are move our feet, get our body behind the ball but as the ball is approaching can we step forward into the pass and time it so as the ball is travelling based on the speed and direction we make contact with the ball as the ball is alongside that standing foot. Here you'll see the player doesn't really move his feet, kind of waits for the ball so it's going to take longer for the ball to travel and in game situations potentially we lose seconds to make decisions and allow defenders to close us down so we want to step towards the ball and be light on our feet. Again we can see the body in a somewhat upright position and the player not really preparing any form of back lift and that again comes from not stepping towards the ball and giving himself the room to do so. Ideally we want to make contact with the ball when the ball is alongside the standing foot so we create this number 10 shape. Again you can see the angle of the non-kicking foot, the angle of the striking foot and the position of the ball so we're both coming across our body with the action and in front of our body so that's going to impact the players balance and ultimate control we can have. The kicking foot, the right foot here you can see the ankle not quite locked fully we want that toe to be pointing up to the ground we can see it pointing slightly down and away making sure we're trying to make contact with the inside curvature of the foot through the middle of the ball in the direction that we want to go. Again bringing this left knee forward, hips forward, chest leaning slightly forward so as we strike and make contact our body is moving through the same line. Again, just looking at the follow-through action, so the player still hasn't moved his left foot through the motion, so we're very planted and rigid through this left leg. We want to be light on our feet when playing the pass, receiving the ball. So if we're going to strike the ball with the outside of the right foot, ideally we would probably land on the right foot and we're bringing our body forward in the next direction that we want to travel, rather than being static through the left leg. You can see the position of the right foot, so all the ball's travelling forwards. If we're going to utilise the outside of the right foot, we want to see the action taking that right foot forward and through the line of the ball before he moves in his next direction, instead of his foot still pointing to the left as his body's facing the direction the ball is travelling. So it's going to limit follow-through action, it's going to limit our ability to move into space. And it's looking at the contact point for the player, so again player making contact in front of the standing foot, so we're going to end up making contact on the follow through motion as opposed to making contact with the balls alongside the foot, keeping the body in a better balanced position. Again we can see the toe pointing down to the ground, heel up, so we're naturally hitting more with the ankle stroke heel, which is going to have less control for the player, so we want to strike through the middle of the ball with the inside curvature of the foot with the heel down, toe up, right through the middle of the ball in the direction that we want to go. You can also see by hitting the ball in front of the body makes it harder for us to get our hips and our chest forward over the ball because we are reaching with the left leg, so we want to try and get our hips forward, our chest leaning forward by getting the non-kicking foot in the right position and maybe bending this right knee more on contact so we're stepping forward into the pass. So we're going to have the follow through action, so it's important that we keep our foot in a locked position all the way through the contact and into the follow through, so stay strong, stay with a firm contact with the middle of the ball. So the follow through action is relatively limited, so to generate more control and power the more we can strike through and then fix this right leg into more of a straight leg on the follow through rather than maintain this knee bent, it's going to help us get through the ball. I'd also like to see a little bit of flexibility in the left knee bringing the body forward, so bend that left knee get the hips forward, chest leaning more in the direction that he wants the ball to go to help utilise his body momentum to move forward. Body's in a decent position in terms of the hips and the body facing the way that the pass is being played as well as the angle of the foot facing that way which is going to help us control the direction of the pass. So you can see a slightly better example for the players with the balls travelling in, player moves his feet slightly, moves across, then he's stepping towards the ball and he's stepping towards the ball from a slight angle which is going to help with the rotation of the hips. But that forward step with the right foot is going to allow the player a better chance of moving his body through the line of the pass. Can we get our toe pointing generally in the direction we want the ball to go? Obviously here the toe pointing more towards the post, the right post and outside the line of the goal. So now we're going to have to adjust the contact point with the ball to get the ball travelling to where we intend it to go. So that non-kicking foot is important in terms of the body position, the follow-through action that we can take and making sure that we're preparing our left leg, getting our foot in the right position and timing it so we allow this ball now to travel alongside the standing foot and make contact when it's alongside the right foot. Again, it's looking at the preparation for the player, so ball travelling towards. I'd like to see players stepping in towards the ball and then obviously timing it so on contact from the back lift, the player then makes contact with the ball when the ball is alongside the standing foot. Here the player's right foot as he's preparing to pass with the left. She's very flat footed, very stuck to the ground, very straight leg, so the player's not going to be able to adjust or adapt when I see him on the balls of his feet, slight knee bend and really starting to step towards the ball so he can time the pass with the left foot. Again, body position very upright, so we're going to be in a very rigid and static position when striking the ball. Just looking at contact point with the ball, so we see during the ball approaching the player, the left foot doesn't move and adjust, he's not on the balls of his feet, very straight, rigid leg which is going to impact the cushion and the control that the player can have in his contact. We can see the player utilising the outside of the right foot to play the pass back. So here it's good that the player's toe is starting to point down towards the ground so we can strike through the laces through the middle of the ball. Obviously from this angle we can see the toe pointing slightly to the left. A little bit of this is down to the body position being very upright and straight. So as that ball's coming in, if we're going to play with the outside, can we turn our body slightly to the left so we can really strike through the line of the pass with the laces in the direction that we want the ball to go. The players utilise the left foot, so as we see the ball being played in, we'll see a small step towards the ball, but again we can see the player relatively flat-footed and high and static as he's receiving the ball, so waiting for the ball to come to him, which is okay, but in terms of this activity I'd prefer to see the player stepping forwards towards the ball to maximise the body's ability to get forward and attack the ball and move with the ball, so we're making sure we're getting that non-kicking foot in a position where it's pointing in the general direction we want to go, and allowing that ball to travel alongside it so that we can make clean contact. Again, just looking at the contact, so contact point again where the non-kicking foot is and pointing. You can see the line of the pass and then the angle of the right foot is well in front of the standing foot, so we're going to end up again reaching for the ball, making contact on the follow-through action. So it's not going to be as clean as we would ideally want. Foot looks in a slightly better position in terms of heel down, ankle locked, toe up. With having that toe up, we generally should lock that ankle. We need to keep that contact through the ball. Again, hard to see the ball making contact with the inside curvature of the foot still closer to the heel, which is going to affect the clarity of the pass. The heel is a harder, more rounded surface, so the ball can go off on a varying tangent. And again, we can see the angle of the foot looks like we're looking to play back obviously towards the player, to the left side of the goal, the non-kicking foot, the hips, the body, everything's pointing to the right. So if we're coming across our body, it's going to have an impact on our balance and our follow-through motion. So again the follow through action, so obviously the player brings his right foot inside, makes contact with the ball and then follows through in a circular motion to the outside. But we can see the left foot still not moving as the player makes the pass. So all the control and accuracy and power is generally coming from the right leg and the right foot. We want to be striking the ball with the foot and then either following through in the line of the ball or moving quickly into the next space that we want to receive the ball. So in terms of the technical choice as well as the technical actions, some different elements that we can improve. Definitely improving the body position, we can see the body is in a very upright position, being rooted through this left leg as he's playing the pass. So it limits the control, accuracy and power we can generate. Once again, the player preparing to receive the ball. So as the ball is starting to travel in, we want to adjust our feet, be on the balls of our feet, move behind the line of the ball. Here, the player again, very rooted to the ground, very flat-footed, want to be on the balls of our feet, feet shoulder width apart and looking ready to receive and adjust. Player here in a very upright position, just waiting for the ball to come in. But ideally, we want to make sure that as the ball's coming in, we provide the space to come into the area alongside the standing foot as much as we can if we're going to play a pass with the inside of our foot. So then just looking at the contact point with the ball, we can see the position of the toe, both in the direction that it's facing and then obviously the angle and where we're making contact with the ball and the angle of the foot. It's going to make it very difficult for us to strike cleanly through the ball and maintain our balance. So when we're looking to make contact with the ball, we want to make contact when it's along, especially with the inside of the foot, contact alongside the standing foot, but that standing foot needs to be generally pointing in the direction we want to go so we can get our body position in a better position so we're not now bringing this right knee inside, which is naturally going to bring the foot into this position with the toe down, heel up. It's going to make it difficult to strike through the middle of the ball because we generally will hit the ball closer to the heel with our toe down or the bottom half of the ball. So the foot is coming much closer to the line of the non-kicking foot, which makes it more difficult to strike through the ball cleanly with the right lower leg coming more vertically down to the ground. The player again looking to receive the ball from a rolling position so as the ball is coming in the player is pretty static and standing in one spot so we want to see the player on the balls of their feet, maybe a slight knee bend, moving those feet behind the line of the ball coming in so then it can be better balanced and controlled for whatever technical choice the player makes whether playing the pass with the inside or with the outside of the foot. Follow through is very important, see the foot changes shape and wobbles through the contact so if the foot stays in a locked position it shouldn't really move through the contact and all the way through the line of the ball. Ideally we want to keep this leg as it goes from this bend position on the follow through to a straight leg to maximise the control and power and also again the left foot doesn't really move through the action so as we're striking through with the right we want to be a little bit more lighter on the feet, keeping the hips forward, chest forward, not leaning back as we're moving into a pass moving forwards. Once again, just looking at the player's preparation, ball travelling in towards, player does take a step towards the line of the ball which is important, but still allowing that ball obviously to travel in alongside the standing foot. Where we plant the non-kicking foot is important, so it's pointing here towards the right post and slightly outside, that controls the body position, the follow through action helps with our balance and control. So here we can see the player is stepping towards, but again we want to be a little bit more agile and ready to receive the ball. So step in, can we bend that knee, prepare this left leg, there's no real back lift which is okay, but we can see the player coming from a very static position, upright body position, we want to step in and make sure that we're in a fully balanced position as we're making contact with the ball. So again, preparing to play the pass with the inside of the right foot. So as the ball's travelling in, we want to be on the balls of our feet, move our body in position behind the line of the ball, step towards the ball with the left foot. If we're going to prepare to play with the right, so the player does this well, we want to make sure that our non-kicking foot is generally pointing in the direction that we want to play the pass, because that helps control our follow through and our body position as well as our balance, and being in a position where we can allow the ball to travel alongside the standing foot to strike through. We can see as the player's preparing, very upright position, very static, so that's going to limit the momentum that the player can generate through the pass. Right preparance player pass with the left foot, so obviously the ball is travelling in and player is starting to move his feet across, does take a step towards the ball with the right foot as he plants it which is fine because we want to allow that ball, we want to step towards the ball but allow that ball to travel alongside the standing foot. Again the non-kicking foot we ultimately want to be pointing towards the direction that we want the ball to travel or how we're looking to receive the ball, this helps control the follow through of the body position so we can see the body position is pointing out towards that left hand side so and then depending on the outcome of the player that can affect the technical action of the contact with the ball. Again the follow through is very important, you can see the foot changes its position and angle both in terms of the direction it's facing and the position of the foot. So if we don't have that locked ankle and firm contact all the way through the ball it's going to affect the quality of the pass. You can also see the follow through is still in that bent knee position rather than moving through with a straight leg. So again it limits the control and the power of the pass and the motion of the follow through is limited as well so we lose elements of control. You can also see the direction of the ball and the final body position at the end of that follow through, body still facing to the right, legs coming across the body to the left and the left foot is still planted very much through the ground with a straight leg. So we don't have our body momentum moving through the ball, we don't have a full amount of balance so the pass is going to be affected. The follow through action, again we want to keep our foot in a locked, firm position all the way through the strike. So the foot we want it to be angled in the way we want to go but there was a little bit of a wobble with the foot in the follow through so it shows the ankle is not quite locked so we're not going to get as firm enough contact with the ball. We can also see that the follow through action again very limited as it's coming through the initial line of the ball but then our body is leaning back and away, our hips and our chest are facing one way as the ball is travelling the other and the body is still leaning in the direction away from the ball. Not utilising the arms for additional balance and momentum so we need to be stepping towards the ball so we can increase and improve elements of our technique and body position. Again, just looking at the contact with the ball, we can see the ball being made contact slightly in front of the line of the standing foot. Again, just leads to us making contact on an upwards movement within the follow through. Also, it makes it more difficult to get our body forwards and through the line of the pass. So, we want to make contact with the ball when it's alongside the standing foot. Can we get our heel down, toe slightly up so we can make contact through the middle of the ball, the inside curvature of the foot. Here again, it's hard to see from here, but it looks like it's making more contact closer to the heel, stroke, ankle, which is going to have an impact on the control and accuracy of the pass that we can make. And trying again, making sure that we're trying to bend this right knee forward, get our hips in line with the ball when we can, get our chest leaning forwards towards the direction we want to play the pass. Again, all made difficult when the non-kicking foot doesn't get alongside the ball on contact because we're naturally going to be reaching for the ball with the left foot. So again, just talking about the preparation for the player. So it's important that we are alert, ready to adjust and adapt on receiving the ball, whether we're playing a pass first time or receiving. So we want a player to be on the balls of their feet, maybe the feet shoulder width apart, slight bend in the knees so we're ready to adjust, get our body behind the line of the ball. So although here you can see the ball's traveling in and the player is generally in a line behind the ball, you can see how close his feet are together. So he's not necessarily ready to receive the ball fluently, not kicking foot. In this case, he's gonna be playing the ball with the right so his left foot is very planted to the ground, straight leg, high body position. So it's gonna limit our options as we're receiving the ball. Looking at the player again, as the ball is approaching the player, coming towards him, again important for our footwork, body position to get behind the line of the ball. We can see as the ball is travelling on a slight angle, the right foot is coming in planted, again we want to try and step towards a rolling ball as much as we can, allows us to get our body moving towards and then through the ball, maintain our balance and momentum going forwards and obviously we want to try and plant our foot in a way that it's pointing in the direction we want to go to help with our body position and control. Once again we can see a player making contact with the ball well in front of the standing foot. So again that just means that now we're making contact with the ball on the follow through. So even if we strike through the middle of the ball, the follow through action is going to be going up and through the middle to the top of the ball. So it's going to affect a lot of elements of quality and control. By limiting the follow through action it's also going to limit the power that we can generally create. Making sure we keep the ankle locked, heel down, toe up so the foot here is in a slightly better position, a little bit more parallel to the ground. So we can get that toe locked up so we're really striking through the middle of the ball, maximising the control and accuracy. And then also looking at the non-kicking foot, so where that's pointing is generally going to be controlling the body position and we want everything to be aligned. So on contact can we get the inside of the foot, can we get the hips, the body, the non-kicking foot all pointing towards the same direction to maximise the control of the passing action. And follow through action for me very important in any kind of pass or ball striking. We want to keep the ankle locked and our foot in a steady position all the way through the contact. So from the back lift to the contact to now the follow through. Can we keep that foot locked in the same position? Here you can see the follow through very limited and now the angle of the foot is pointing away. So the more we can strike through the line of the ball and in that direction, the more control and power we're going to generate. We can also see how limited the follow through action is. So I'm going to go through a straight leg all the way through the ball. That will help bring our body forward and again control the ball better, more power and accuracy. If we can get a slight knee bend in this right leg to bring the hips and the chest moving forward rather than leaning back, that's going to again help with our balance and control. Then just looking at the follow-through action for the player. For me it's important the follow-through keeps our foot in a locked position, move the foot through with the foot in that locked position through the line of the pass. So here we can see the angle of the foot is changing as we move through. So we have them come all the way through the line of the ball, can we get a straight leg in that follow-through, but keep our body facing the direction we want the pass to go. So here you can see the non-kicking foot pointing to the left towards the right post and generally that helps control where the hips and the body position is facing. So now we're striking through the ball across our body a little bit, which is going to limit our ability to have full control and balance. You can just see the follow through action, again very limited for the player, still in this bent knee shape. So we want to keep the ankle locked all the way through the line of the pass. The foot does wobble again on contact with the heel. So we want to try and keep that foot angled and locked all the way through the line of the pass with a straight leg. Again bending this right knee, it's hard to get the hips and the body forward when we're making contact with the ball in front of the standing foot. So that's where that preparation is important, stepping into the line of the pass and moving forwards with it. So it's looking at the preparation from the player, so the ball travelling towards the player. Important that we move our feet, get our body behind the line of the ball first and foremost. Player here not necessarily working on the balls of his feet, we can see a very static position. So although the body's behind the ball we see a very flat foot, straight leg, so I'd see the player on the balls of their feet, slight knee bend, slight bounce in terms of anticipating the ball coming in, it will help with the action of the pass itself. Making sure that we're keeping our eyes on the ball, allowing the ball to travel into the position between the standing foot and the spacing between the body, create that number 10 shape to make contact. So ideally we'd be stepping towards the ball as the ball's coming in, timing it so as we make contact with the ball, the ball is alongside the standing foot. Again looking at the contact point with the ball, making contact with the ball well in front of the standing foot means that we're going to be reaching for the ball slightly and making contact on our way up through the ball which is going to impact the quality, consistency, control and power on the shot. You can see the toe is pointing down to the ground so we're going to hit the ball again closer to the heel, stroke ankle or the lower half of the ball. We want to try and get this heel down, toe up, lock our ankle, strike through the middle of the ball in the direction we want the ball to go. Ideally we would want the non-kicking foot to be planted so it's pointing the direction we want to go. That's going to help us control our body position, body shape and play in the pass because we want our hips and our chest aligned with the follow through in the direction we want to play the pass. If the non-kicking foot is pointing slightly to the left that's going to affect the follow through motion because now we're going to be rotating around and it's going to affect the body position of the player. Again, just looking at the immediate follow-through action for the player, which is important in the pass or the strike. We can see as the player makes contact, the foot changes his position a few times, shows that the ankle may be not fully locked as we go through. We also want to try and keep this foot positioned facing the direction we want the ball to go. It's going to show us that we have a firm locked ankle contact on the ball and come through with a straighter leg to maximise the power and control. Obviously when the knee is bent, the ankle is not loose, the contact is probably not going to be as firm. And again, we can see the body position as the ball is travelling forwards, body is still leaning backwards and away, players arms not really being utilised for any additional balance and the feet close together. So, in terms of what the player can do next is going to be limited. Again, just a follow through action, we can see the foot changes positions throughout both in angle as well as the foot position itself. So it shows we maybe don't have a firm locked ankle for a firm contact through the ball. The follow through action is again very limited, rooted through this right leg. So he's not bringing his full leg through the ball, keeping his foot in that locked position through the direction he wants to go. So better in terms of his body position, you see his chest and his hips are facing the line of the pass in line with the non-kicking foot, but the body is still leaning back and away from that direction of the pass where we want to be moving forward, bending this right knee, going our hips slightly further forward, chest leaning slightly further forward to get our body momentum moving through the pass. And just looking at the contact with the ball, we can see again the player not moving his feet planted to the ground through his standing foot. So now if he's going to use the outside of his right foot, it's actually okay for his body to turn this way as he strikes through the ball. But then as we're striking the ball, we want to have our body momentum moving forwards into the next space or through the line of the pass that we're going to play. Because the left foot doesn't move, we end up reaching for the ball, the distance between the non-kicking foot and the right foot that's passing the ball becomes greater. So then we lose elements of balance and we can't maximise the control and accuracy and power on the pass itself. You can also see from reaching, it's very difficult to get this toe down. So we end up making contact with the foot a little flat and more parallel to the ground. And that's going to affect our quality of our pass as well as our quality of movement after making contact. And ideally, if we're going to bend this left knee, we're bringing our hips and our body forwards towards the ball so then we can move fluently in the next action. Follow through action for the player is a little limited, very short action to follow through. We can see the foot changing position quite quickly so we want to try and keep this foot in a locked position, ankle locked, following through in the direction we want to go. Ideally with the foot still facing that way, straight leg, bending this right knee forward, hips, chest leaning forward towards the direction that we want to go, not leaning back and away. Looking at the contact point for the pass, so again the player stays very static through the right foot, he's not stepping towards it. We can see the player reaching now with the left foot, so the distance between the non-kicking foot and the foot striking the ball with the left foot is increasing. So we're leaning forward and reaching for the ball so we don't have the full maximum effect of the contact and the follow through motion. Foot, again we can see the toe pointing slightly down to the ground, a little bit more parallel than some prior. That comes from reaching for the ball, so we want to try and get this toe slightly up, heel down, make sure that we're making contact with the inside curvature of the foot, not the heel with the middle of the ball because we lose control due to the rounded and hard nature of the surface. And make sure then we are connecting with the ball, going straight through the ball. Again you can see the body position is reaching out, back is leaning back and quite straight up and again the arms not really being utilised for additional balance, momentum or control. Again we can see player looking to utilise the inside of the right foot. We see the foot in a slightly better position with the toe up a little bit more. The leg in a better position in terms of the lower leg vertically down, not tucked in. Although here we can see the ball making contact closer to the heel. We want to make contact through the inside curvature of the foot through the middle of the ball for the maximum control and accuracy when the ball hits the heel. The ball can go off in different directions because it's a rounded surface and a harder surface so we need to really focus on getting the inside of the foot through the ball in the direction we want to play it. We can see again the non-kicking foot on contact is pointing way out to the right and is behind the line of the ball. So now we end up reaching for the ball, potentially coming across our body or leaning as we make contact. We can see that from the body position leaning back and away. We'd like this left knee to be bending as he's making contact, bringing the hips forward, chest slightly leaning forward, head in a position over the ball so we can get our body momentum moving through the line of the pass. The end player not really maximising the follow through, foot looks like it's in a more locked position throughout but we only fractionally go through the line of the ball. So the less contact and the less follow through, the less power we can generate, the less control we ultimately have. We can also see the player's body still slightly behind the line of the standing leg and way behind the line of the ball where we make impacts so by leaning back and away we're not maximising our body momentum to move through the pass. Again, the follow through, very important for control and power. We see the foot changing shape slightly, so it's not fully locked as we go through or the contact is off. So it's important we get this foot following through, angled in the same direction we want the pass. Can we go from that bent knee position, making contact to a straight leg through the ball, so the player stays very structured in that shape, very shallow follow through, very static with the non-kicking leg. So we want to try and bring our hips forward, body slightly forward in the line of the pass, keep everything aligned so obviously the non-kicking foot pointing to the right. That's where the body is now lined up to, but the ball is travelling towards the left based on the body position. So can we strike through the ball and get our body moving through the line of the shot. Again, it's looking at the preparation, so the ball's traveling towards the player. Player does take a slight step towards the ball, so it's important when we're stepping forward it's going to be timed in a way that we can step forward and make contact with the ball as the ball travels to a position alongside the standing foot. So that timing and patience is important. Can we get the toe pointing in the general direction? We want the ball to go next. That's going to help with the follow-through action, the body position, the balance of the player, and then obviously trying to be in a ready position. So here a little upright and static, so that we're stepping forward, be on the balls of our feet and be ready to strike through that ball as it comes in. So we're just looking at the preparation for the player, so we're looking at the direction of the ball coming in. We want the player to be on the balls of their feet, moving behind the line of the ball, ideally if we're looking to make a pass. We can see the left foot again, very planted and rooted to the ground as the ball's coming in. So unless we're moving our feet it's going to limit the choices, the balance, the control that we have over the ball. So again, player preparance, player pass being played towards him. Player does take a step towards the ball, which I like, from a slight angle, which is going to help with the body position and the hips moving through the ball. Again you can see the non-kicking foot as it lands is pointing more towards the right. The non-kicking foot and the way it's pointing is helpful in terms of the follow-through action and the body position of the player. But also helping with the timing as we step forward, improving the back lift and the contact point with the ball. So we want to make sure that we're stepping towards the ball so we can bring this right leg towards the ball so it makes contact as it's alongside the standing foot. Again I like the player maintains strong visual focus on the ball all the way through the action from the ball coming in to the contact and the follow-through. That's going to help him in certain elements of the technical actions. Just looking at the contact with the ball, so the ball is being played in front of the standing leg which is going to mean we're reaching for the ball slightly, making contact with the ball on that follow through action, so that's going to limit the power and control we generate from the follow through. We can also look at the foot position with the heel up, toe down. Ideally we want the heel down, toe slightly up, lock the ankle so we can strike through the middle of the ball. When the foot's in this position, we generally hit the ball closer to the heel, stroke ankle, which is a harder, more rounded service so we lose elements of control. So we want to strike through the middle of the ball with the inside curvature of the foot and lock that ankle, heel down, toe up, show us we get that. We can also see the leg position starting to turn inside, which could be a result of the proximity from the ball to the standing foot and the player obviously naturally there and it's been harder to get the toe pointed up with the leg turning in so we want to try and get this lower leg in a straighter position, more vertical, to help us put the foot in the right position, strike through the ball freely. So again we can see the player preparing to receive a ball rolling towards him. The player does a little bit better here in terms of stepping forward with the left foot as he prepares to strike with the right foot but we can see the direction of the left foot is really pointing out to the right hand side so we want to try and get that toe pointing in the general direction we want to go because that's going to help control our body position and our follow-through action as we make contact and follow through the ball and by stepping towards the ball we want to make sure that we're in a position where we allow that ball to roll alongside the standing foot and we make contact when that ball is level and with the toe so the timing of the of the action is important", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They also have their pelvis quite stiff. If they were to drop that pelvis back, perhaps bending their knees just slightly a bit more, they would be more grounded and activate a way greater range of motion in their pelvis and in their upper legs. They would also be able to activate this greater range of motion by separating their feet more and so that their feet are further away from one another and they're able to twist more deeply and move more effectively through the space. As the dancer starts to incorporate their arms more fully in this moment as they're kind of coming towards the end of the typical or the classic shim-sham-shimmy, they're doing so in a way that is really disconnected from the rhythm and feels very performative. It doesn't feel like they're very connected to, or their arms are very connected to what's happening in their lower body, nor does it feel very connected to the music, so it doesn't feel as though they're engaging in polyrhythm in a meaningful way. Overall, just some additional clarity on the rhythmic embodiment here, as well as the movement dynamics would be beneficial. As the dancer performs this final turn, he's able to make the full turn around himself. However, he would really benefit from spotting his head here, which would enable him to move more quickly and efficiently through the movement. He also has one arm kind of slightly up and the other one very relaxed down to his side. Some added clarity in the shaping and engagement of the arms would help him remain stable and engaged through his entire body. He would also just in general benefit from a slighter bend in the preparation of the supporting leg so that he's able to move more quickly and efficiently through the movement. The dancer begins by performing what appears to be a take on the Shim Sham Shimmy, which is a classic set of movements or phrase of movement in tap dance and also appears in some social dances as well. While they understand the mechanics particularly of the footwork, they're really lacking a full integration of their body into the movement and really lacking rhythmic embodiment. They fall off the music quite repeatedly and really struggle to maintain a consistent connection to the rhythm. They also really don't engage their upper body choreographically in a meaningful way. They use their spine to lean forward and backwards and help with their weight distribution and their weight transfer. However, their arms don't appear to be performing much significant choreography and their range of motion in their pelvis feels very limited. If they were to drop that pelvis back, they've got this nice bend in their knees already, but dropping the pelvis back would help them to be more grounded and be able to move more quickly and efficiently through the steps. Here the dancer appears to struggle with the transition of the movement. He moves his feet very quickly in this very kind of staccato motion that really disconnects from the rhythm. Perhaps like he forgot the choreography or maybe is trying to transition from one step to the other while being a bit confused in his movement or trying to find his new footwork. He would just benefit here from some clarity, some deeper understanding of the choreography perhaps some additional rehearsal to memorize the order of the movements. As the dancer incorporates their arms, particularly in their hands, in a way that's audible, here by snapping, they're able to reconnect to the rhythm of the music and find this kind of full-body connection to the music that they had been missing prior. Perhaps they need to incorporate the snapping or the clapping throughout their performance to help them maintain this connection to the rhythm and continue to embody the rhythm. As the dancer continues through this performance of a take on a Shim Sham Shimmy, it becomes clear that they are performing kind of the tap dance typical version of the Shim Sham Shimmy, in which case they're able to perform the movement, particularly from the knees and down through the feet. However, they're not making any clear sounds with the feet, which would be expected in this version of the Shim Sham Shimmy, particularly in this step that he's performing now. While it might not be typical to include the arms choreographically to a very full extent in a tap dance or in the Shim Sham Shimmy in general, they are kind of lacking clarity in their shape in general and don't appear to be helping the dancer connect to the rhythm or perform the movement. Overall, they really need to find more clarity in the sounds coming from their shoes or from their feet, and also find a greater range of motion and a more relaxed feeling through their shoulders, their spine, and their pelvis.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You can see her gaze off to the side, perhaps looking for help. When she's holding her head like this and performing her movements and her body at more of a minimal level rather than performing them full out, it appears like she forgets the choreography or is struggling to remember what comes next. Memorization could be something for her to work on because it also shows in her body that her technical skill and her connection to the rhythm decreases when she appears to be confused. The dancer is able to stay pretty closely connected to the rhythm here as she's performing this undulation or rotation of the shoulders and also the pelvis. She could use a little bit more relaxation in her arms which kind of stay somewhere between tucked to the side of her and loosely out to the side. She could really loosen up those arms and those shoulders here to create even more dynamic in her movement. She also could benefit from bending the knees and dropping the pelvis down to ground her closer to the floor. As the dancer performs this transitional step touch side to side while moving about the room and changing her facing, she appears confident and relaxed. She's got a smile on her face and she's really connected to the movement through her body. She has these nice relaxed arms that are still making shapes out to the side of her, but are floating appropriately for the step. And her lower body is really maintaining connection with the rhythm while keeping a nice relaxed pelvis. The dancer starts this performance quite strong, showing she has a command over the technique and the ability to embody the rhythm. She's got a nice shape here through her arm with a nice flexed palm and her other arm circling or kind of curving in front of her chest. She also has a nice line here through her leg which is crossing over in front of her other leg. And her spine and her torso overall, including her pelvis, appear free and connected to the rhythm. As the dancer performs this basic step touch side to side with the bouncing quality in her body, she is thrown off the rhythm quite significantly for the first time in this performance. She's bouncing too much in her upper body, which is not connected to the rhythm, and kind of causing her limbs, particularly her arms, to flail out from the side of her. Her head is also moving quite significantly. You can see her gaze is tilted to the side quite significantly, which is throwing her off the rhythm and overall making this movement appear awkward and out of place. The dancer appears quite unsure here. She's got her gaze really looking off to the side, disconnected from the rest of her body. And her body's performing the movement while staying connected to the rhythm. However, she's performing the movement quite small and not 100% full out. She's able to maintain the rhythm through the step touch in her feet and also has a nice looseness in her arms and upper body. Here the dancer appears confident. She's got a slight smile on her face with her gaze really appearing upward stretching over this fingertip. She's also got a nice shape happening here with her arms with these nice posed hands as well as in her legs where she's got this one leg bent with the weight resting on the ball of the foot and the other leg acting as her supporting leg the appropriate distance away. She's got a nice shape here with her body and shows command over the technical skill and also her ability to embody rhythm while adding interesting dynamics into her movement.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They're not doing the foundational step. They're not even stepping on the beat. You know, this type of dance really is all about the music, embodying the music, and staying on the beat, and they've lost that basic foundation. So here again he tried to get her to join him and she completely ignored him and just turned around and kept dancing away from him. So it's important if he's the leader to let him be the leader and to say yes to his contact because that's an agreed upon, agreed upon, that's what's agreed upon when you decide to do a partner dancing such as this. I think another big kind of conceptual issue that I'm having with their dancing is that they're not on the beat, but I don't think they even notice that. And that's a big red flag. That means that they are not very skilled dancers yet, and they're trying to do all these complex choreography. They're just not ready for it. They should be recognizing right away when they get off the beat and doing their very, very darndest to get back on it before trying any other fancy turns and things like that. So it's just not performance ready. Again, everything I've said before, they both don't have enough control. He's too tightly held in and she's too flailing. You know, she's trying to do some various kicks and he's trying to sort of imitate her. So I think now they're back to her sort of back leading him even though they're not physically in contact and it's not working. Good, so now they are doing a basic foundational step. So they're doing some sort of swing, step one, slow, slow, quick, quick, slow, something like that. And they're both doing it. They're both on the opposite foot of each other, which is great. Unfortunately, they're both dancing on flat feet. That's not a good idea. Dancing on the balls of the feet is the best way to dance, especially in partner dancing, so that you have freedom of movement, so that you can move efficiently and quickly. Okay, so here he's the leader and so what he's done here in this moment is offered his hand to her. I think he probably should have waited until she was done turning because she doesn't, I don't think she sees that he's doing that. Actually I can tell she can't because she's not looking at his hand here. So I would just recommend that he waits so that she can actually see when he offers the hand because otherwise we as viewers were just seeing him hold his hand out and she's not taking it. The way that she's moving her arms here is another clear indication of a lack of technique and a lack of experience. This sort of weak elbow shape with this up turned wrist is really common in inexperienced dancers. For some reason people think that that's what dancers are doing when they're moving their arms and so when they try to imitate it that's how it comes across. So very obvious to me that she doesn't have a lot of dance experience. Also her head again lack of control, lack of coordination. She's got her head all tilted off to the side. That's not adding anything to the shape that she's doing. In fact it's just making it look even more flailing and less controlled. Okay, he's lost the basic foundational step now. Not good. Again, they're not going to be coordinated with each other. And they aren't actually. They're already not coordinated because you can see she has her weight on this foot and a sort of a lunge backwards here. If they were mirroring each other, he would have this foot forward in that lunge and the second foot behind, but he's doing the opposite of that. He's sort of got his weight on both feet, but with this leg back. So they've lost each other and that's because he did not continue with the basic foundational step. So she's collapsed inward towards him and that's because neither of them are doing any sort of basic foundational step. They kind of haven't agreed, in their minds at least, what they're doing. I don't even know what style of dance they're doing here because they are not doing a basic foundational step. And so that's going to make them not well coordinated with each other. And so things like this will happen. They'll crash into each other at times because they aren't communicating and they're not doing the same step as each other. That's just the bottom line. Okay, here he offers his hand and she's just simply refuses it. She just sort of brushes him off so that she can do her own thing. That's not okay. She's not the leader. And I don't care what, what, who, if she becomes, if she wants to be the leader, then she should be the leader. Back leading like this is not, it's not good because it's confusing to both of them. It also puts him in this position of having to do a bunch of solos, improvisation solos that he clearly does not want to do. If she wants to do a little solo, then she should just do a solo for three minutes by herself without involving him. It's really not quite fair to him. And it's also confusing and makes them, it makes them be even more disconnected and more discoordinated when they're, when they are dancing together. Okay, so the music has gone into this really cool, like, scatting moment, and the scatting singer is doing some really complex, quick staccato rhythms, and they've completely lost the beat again. They're not even dancing on the tempo, and so especially is highlighted and emphasized in this moment because the music has this really beautiful staccato quality to it that they aren't mimicking whatsoever. Also, they made some kind of mistake here. Basically, she's not following him very well, and so what he's trying to get her to do, they're not accomplishing, but then she sort of laughs about it, and she kind of collapsed downwards, and so she's just highlighting the mistake that they made. It's important to hide mistakes as much as possible. She's back leading again. She decided, okay, I want to do a dip now. And she just went into a dip. Problem with that is that's he's number one, he's the leader. They should do a dip when he's ready for a dip because it would actually be more successful. This is not a successful dip because his energy is still traveling this direction and she's stopped. She's not traveling any direction and then arced backwards. And so he can't really support her very well in this dip. And the energy is all off as well. I shouldn't say energy, but the trajectory, the momentum is all off. Again, they're not coordinated. And so the dip is not as successful as it could be if he were involved in the dip and had initiated it. It's successful for her in a little way because she's so flexible. She can really arch her back very far back. So she's able to get a strong arc there, but the whole pattern and the quality of it is not working. If she weren't that flexible, this wouldn't work. This would be even less successful. This is an awkward turn and I think it's because she doesn't have a strong frame with her shoulder and so as he's Suggesting that they turn it's her arm that moves first rather than her whole body moving with her I mean, it's really nice that she's doing these really full movements with her arms, but the problem a couple problems One is she's super hyper extended through this elbow She needs to work on strengthening through her biceps so that that doesn't happen mostly for her own health long term That's not good to keep doing that hyper extension, but also because it makes it so that instead of a line We have a curve here. It doesn't match this side and then she's as she's bringing this arm up and around these arms up and around It's also not symmetrical. It's not consistent. It's not well controlled So again a very flailing quality to her dancing and once again, he's really not done much with his arms or his legs here He's just kind of a same kind of pattern that I mentioned before Okay, so they're starting this improvisation section at the beginning of their choreography, and it's not successful for multiple reasons. Let's talk about the leader first. I know he's the leader, by the way, because I've watched the rest of the choreography and he's meant to be the leader. So he's clearly very uncomfortable. He clearly doesn't have a lot of experience sort of just jamming and improvising because he's very, very stiff with his arms. He basically, with the arms, he kind of holds this straight arm and just kind of moves this arm this way and back, and then this one back and forth like this. He's also very stiff with these very straight knees and stepping on the balls of his, or on the flat feet, and he's kind of arched forward. His chest is a little bit dumped forward. So it's not very interesting to watch. He looks self-conscious and it makes the viewer, it makes me feel self-conscious for him. Which, as an audience member, that's really common. Whatever the dancer is exuding, the audience can feel. One of the worst things you can do is make the audience feel embarrassed for you or self-conscious for you. So what I'd recommend for him is that he try to exaggerate a little bit more. Actually, no. What I would recommend for both of them, they need to get into technique class and they need to practice and get a better, stronger vocabulary before trying to improvise. Dancing is one of the most difficult things that a dancer can do successfully because it can come across as super, super pedestrian, like it is coming across for them, because they don't have enough vocabulary and they don't have enough experience to know how to initiate movement appropriately. And so it looks very, very... His dancing looks very, very stiff and awkward and her dancing looks very, very flailing. They kind of are having these opposite effects because she's doing a little too much and he's not doing enough. For her, her main issue is that she's not moving from her core. You can see that because her pelvis is tilted forward. You can see that in the shape of her body right here. Her pelvis is also lagging behind. So she's not engaged through her core and so she's moving, rather than moving from her core, she's moving from her proximal limbs, especially from her shoulders. So there's this really kind of, like I said, like a flailing quality to what she's doing here and you can see that in this moment, the way her arms are shaped here. She's also not super well coordinated between the arms and legs. Another thing is that because her core is not engaged and her pelvis is tilted forward, she often loses balance and isn't doing that in this moment, but I'll point out when I notice her. I appreciate here that, you know, as there's this loud saxophone sort of sound, she's doing this head roll, but it's not precise enough, it's not controlled enough, so again, it has this sort of flailing quality, it looks very weak. Again, very flailing quality to her dancing. I appreciate that she lets herself, her body go and lets her body move and lets herself get a little bit off balance, but the problem is that she doesn't have adequate control and she doesn't initiate her movement from her core and so it really just looks super super flailing but not like she's intentionally flailing, so it really is just very quite weak. Good, so once she sees it and she's finished her turn, she takes the offering of his hand, which is excellent. They are both, they both happen to end, I don't know if they happen to have planned it, but they happen to end on the correct foot, so they're mirroring each other here, which is great. Good, so here they are dancing on the beat. They're doing this sort of side to side swinging step and they're stepping on the beat, which is excellent. They're also kind of pushing through their hips as they go, especially the followers, she's doing a great job with that. So it gives the step a bit more interest than just a plain side to side. Okay, so here she's done this really big sort of turning leaping thing across the floor. Again, really poor control of her body. It's very flailing, it's not precise. Her pattern pathway across the floor is sort of like that. She's also losing her balance here and that's because she doesn't have adequate core strength and doesn't know how to move from her core or is not moving from her core and so her pelvis is throwing her off balance here. She's kind of falling. Again, a flailing quality to what she's doing. I kind of feel bad for him because she's obviously leading and he's obviously very uncomfortable. She's like cruising across the floor here and he's kind of chasing her but again he doesn't really have adequate control of his body either and so he can't really come up with anything interesting to do. He's just very, very stiff through the arms and also through the legs. Again, very flailing quality to her dancing. She's not super well coordinated. You can see she's kind of losing her balance here. I really appreciate that she has a lot of exuberance and it seems like she really enjoys dancing, which is great. And I don't want her to stop dancing. I actually want her to dance more. I want her to go to more classes. I want her to work on that coordination and that strength. Maybe take some ballet classes that would help with that coordination and that strength that she's really lacking because it's a successful performer combines that love and that joy with strong technique so that as you marry those two things together, it's very pleasing for the viewer. She's missing the technique part of it. So I want her to take that joy and I want her to add the technique and I want her to bring them together. And I want to commend her for having that joy and that exuberance. And I don't want her to not have that. I just want her to again, combine that with more strength and control. What it is is that there's not precision. Neither of them are moving with precision. And it's because again, they don't have enough experience to know where their body is in space at all times, all parts of their body and to place the various parts of their body where they want it to go. So it looks very sloppy and imprecise and very obvious. They don't have very much technique experience, are not ready for improvisation. So I would recommend again, more technique class. I'd recommend don't improvise yet. Have somebody choreograph this section for them and then rehearse the choreography.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Here a small error in pitch was made again, but again the pianist is not letting this affect their overall performance. They are continuing on to the next pitches in the phrase. Just now in this set of arpeggios there was one error in pitch again The pianist is demonstrating good accuracy with pitch and rhythm with this scale. They are continuing to demonstrate excellent finger crossing technique. They are shifting to different spots on the keyboard very gracefully. Again, here an incorrect pitch was played. It would help to review this portion of the scale at a slower tempo multiple times, then gradually work it up to performance speed to get better pitch accuracy on the way down the scale. It would help to review this set of arpeggios hands separately multiple times at a slower tempo while watching the fingers when crossing and making sure that they land on the correct keys to play the correct pitches in each pattern. You can see the pianist demonstrating great hand position in both the left and right hands. Their fingers are curved and rounded over the keys. Here another incorrect pitch was played. It would definitely help to practice the descending arpeggios here hands separately at a slower tempo multiple times while watching the fingers as they cross to make sure that they are playing the correct keys and correct pitches in this pattern. Gradually work each hand separately back up to performance speed and slowly work on performing this portion of the arpeggios hands together again. Here are some of the notes in the right hand part of the scale. When descending the scale, we're a little bit softer than the rest. It would help to practice the transition from playing the last few notes in the ascending portion of the scale leading into the first few notes of the descending portion to work on pressing the fingers a little more firmly on each of the pitches and keys and making sure that each pitch is equal in volume when coming down the scale. Again, here there was an error in pitch played by the third finger in the right hand after crossing. The pianist did a better job with this set of arpeggios with their finger crossing and performing accurate pitches. Throughout this scale, the hands and fingers were in very close proximity, and the pianist maintained their pitch accuracy and clear sound when performing this scale. Here again an incorrect pitch was played, but the pianist is continuing on and maintaining their steady tempo. Here another incorrect pitch was played. It would help to practice the last few notes in the ascending portion of the arpeggios leading into the first few notes of the descending portion of the arpeggios to gain more pitch accuracy. The pianist performed a major scale hands together. We performed at a steady, fast tempo and with perfect pitch and rhythmic accuracy. For this scale, you can see the hands are very close in proximity, the thumbs are on two adjacent white keys, and the pianist is continuing to shift accurately and play all of their pitches in the scale so far accurately without having the fingers bump into one another. Another mistaken pitch was made here, but the pianist is continuing on with their arpeggios. It would definitely help to practice this set of arpeggios hands separately at a slower tempo to review the pattern of pitches, then work on hands together at a slow tempo while watching the fingers when crossing to continue to maintain pitch accuracy. Here you can see the right hand fingers are extended to cover a wider range of notes. The pianist is continuing to use great finger crossing technique and they are having no difficulty when expanding their fingers or reaching them further apart to cover a wider range. Here you can see the right hand fingers are crossed over the left hand fingers to cover a smaller range of notes. Here an incorrect pitch was played, but the pianist is continuing on and not letting this affect the rest of their arpeggios. You can see the right hand fingers are expanded and throughout the arpeggios the pianist is continuing to shift to different spots on the keyboard very gracefully and smoothly. The pianist is demonstrating excellent finger crossing technique with both their right and left hand fingers.

This is demonstrating really excellent technique and being very efficient. The guitarist has a very efficient left hand which is helping them play these faster scales very smoothly. They're keeping their fingers close to the fingerboard and they're also using this pivot motion to make an efficient use of their hand. The guitarist is strumming the string with their finger and then quickly dampening it. This is in effect to have a shorter articulation. These arpeggios are very even and sound great the whole time. They have great control in their right hand and they have a very good understanding of how much weight they're putting in each of the strings. The guitarist makes a very smooth shift here. They have really excellent timing with their left hand in between their strumming, so it doesn't become an audible shift. The guitarist starts playing some scales, alternating between their first finger and their second finger, plucking the string. As they're playing arpeggios, it's very clean. There's a very slight tendency though to rush. It'd be helpful for them just to practice with a metronome so they can get their rhythm really spot on. The guitarist has really excellent technique that they're able to get up and down the fingerboard with ease and have a really great sound. The guitarist has a very relaxed left hand. They're also using a pivot motion from their arm slash wrist to rotate the balance of the hand from one note to another.

I mean, obviously he plays basketball, impressive touch, like pretty experienced, but he wasn't doing the drill the right way. He should be moving his feet, jumping, getting angles on the right and left side, not just spinning the ball for backboard. I'll give it to him. He is doing a good job of it and it's a harder layup.

She could finish the line even with more energy by extending her fingers fully. Either straight forward would be fine, or if she broke her wrist and angled them downward, as long as it was purposeful, that would be fine too. But just finishing this line, that is great because it's straight with even more energy by choosing a direction for her fingers to be facing. The dancer can add in some energy here by just emphasizing when her arm is in front of her with a little flick of her fingers perhaps. Just to add in some extra energy and extra punctuation mark. She's placing her hands perfectly but they're very exact and there's not a great deal of artistic flair here. The dancers feet are also very close together and that is how they're supposed to be here. There should be meeting and she's doing that well by having her feet in the proper position. While the dancer pulls her left hip back on the diagonal to the left corner of the room, at the same time she pulls her right shoulders out to the right. So in total, she's stepping with her right foot, pulling her hips diagonally left, and then pulling her shoulders diagonally, horizontally to the right. So she's creating a triangle or a zigzag here with her body, and that is great. The dancer does a really good job of her eyes looking forward perfectly here that she's spotting the curtain and She does that well so that she gets her full 360 degree turn without any hesitations and without Any distractions she just ends up exactly where she's meant to be by spotting that point exactly The dancer is in full control of her body, which is really great. She's bringing her arms at the same level. They're in front of her, but they're not blocking her face. So she has great control there that we're still able to see her face clearly from where she is bringing her arm out. The dancer is very light on her feet and puts her weight onto her toes when she's dancing Which is why she's able to go forwards and backwards and change direction like this with weight shifts without a problem The dancer's arms are very elegant here. She alternates with one higher versus one lower. With each step she takes, she alternates it. When she steps with her right foot, her left arm is higher. When she steps with her left foot, her right arm is higher. And that is great oppositional there. The dancer is dancing monotone. Everything she's doing is executed very well. But when she's doing this step of three series, step out, step in, and then cross over, all three steps have equal say here, which shows that she's very controlled, and it's great that she's able to have that control and purposefully make each step have the same amount of weight, same amount of emphasis. But now that she's able to execute this step perfectly, she can play with dynamics and artistry so that she can put her weight further in to any of these steps of her choosing and create some sort of dynamic so that it's not three steps that are all equal, but that there is some shifts in some steps that are higher energy or take longer time or have more space within them. Just finding these pockets on holds where she could add in some nuances would elevate her dancing even more. The dancer also executes the step in place. She's not lifting her legs up and down, and she's not moving at all in terms of traveling. She's staying stationary, which is how this dance step is supposed to be executed. The dancer is also moving her hips on backwards diagonals. Here she steps with her right foot and while in doing so she pulls her hips backwards diagonally on the left. She does the opposite when she steps with her left foot pulling her hips backward diagonally on the right. And this is great. It's creating this sort of diagonal in her body and that is executed perfectly here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I would encourage them to think about the direction they need to go each single time they turn, so to have more clarity. Here I would encourage the dancer to really think about being really clean and sharp with their arms to increase the overall precision of the dance. I think this dancer, since this is advanced salsa, can really think about when to move more staccato versus when to have more flow in their movement. Here, this movement right here is a perfect example of if they were grounded, they would be able to kind of do these step, step, step, step, step, step, step really quickly. So dropping that weight and really dropping that pelvis and dropping that weight and bending those legs would allow them to move really quickly on the balls of their feet. I would encourage a dancer to really think about moving from staccato to legato movements and thinking about movement quality because the arm should really flow and you should really point really longingly across the space. So understanding that legato movement before it moves into these really quick, fast steps. This dancer did a really great job of transitioning to the floor and getting back up by understanding where to shift their weight. So kudos to them. This is still a salsa, so I would encourage the dancer to really think about hip articulation. I think the dancer really needs to think about grounding and really working from opening their feet more when they dance so they have a stability throughout to move really quickly.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Think of it as a clamp. Now the climber must remain to keep the elbow down to create friction when sustaining the grip. Now as the climber is working on moving quickly before getting to the left hand hold, climber had placed his left foot and kept the right leg extended and pressed down and pressed with the toe against the wall to generate power for his stance as well as bringing his hips close to the wall. Here the climber has been able to release the right foot out of place after placing pressure on the left foot. As we can see, he needs to make sure that he brings his center of gravity underneath the hold that's been held above him. This in order to then, after making the right foot placement, the climber can release the left hand to the next handhold. The climber has a two-hand hold start. The top grip, the climber must create pressure by leaning on the hold and pressing it towards him as he is at the same time engaging the left-hand grip on an undercling, meaning that there is a jug that is positive and seems to be placed upside down, where the climber must slide the fingers underneath the hold. In order to sustain this hold, the climber must create a pulling position towards him the way that the climber is compressing the move when making the foot placement. This time the climber has placed the right foot on a foot chip and once the climber gets to bring the left foot out of the mat, then the climb will start. As the climber went up for the reach, you can see he was able to make the hand placement, but wasn't able to apply friction, reason why the right hand has slipped out of place. This was also due to the leg that was out on the flag. He then was struggling in making a foot placement and had send it behind him, driving the force of gravity down, not helpful for the climbers making the right hand placement up to the block. The climber has sent the left hand to come into place to match the right hand hold. This one, it's called a jug. And so since this one has a big lip, the climber is able to wrap his hands around it to sustain the grip. However, the climber has pulled into the hole engaging more pressure onto the grips and the climber has lost applying pressure on the left foot when making the placement of the left hand. This can compromise the climber from over gripping and tiring the upper body just the beginning of the climb. So in order for the climber to get back into the wall, you would need to engage his core to make a foot placement down below. You can see the climber bringing his left foot placement to place the toe above the hand hold grip. This one being an undercling. In this instance the climber right now will have to continue to create pressure by pulling on the hold while pressing down the toe against the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So they're really swinging hips right to left to right with the goal of releasing at the apex of this jump so that they can catch the hold. And again, it's just kind of reward climbing. The dino that they do at the end is straightforward, and because the climber is tall enough, this is not a very difficult move. Great use of bringing the second hand up immediately to get over the top of the hold.

As the dancer begins a series of turns which locomote him through the space, primarily forwards and backwards, this is a real moment of shine for the dancer. He's including his head by spotting his head, which is helping him to maintain rhythmic consistency, clarity, and efficiency.

This is another moment where they could be really more grounded so they can execute quickly like they did when they were transitioning to the floor. I would encourage this dancer to think about having power behind their arms because they have a really great flow. As soon as the music started, they will really have this great musicality, but having that power behind the musicality takes it to the advanced salsa level. The dancer did a really great job of transitioning to the floor. Notice how they slide their knee through and really shift their weight and use their hips to glide them to the floor. And then be able to press that hand down and then use their hips to push up to get into this bridge position. So this is a really good understanding of weight distribution. And I would encourage them to use this under curving and groundedness throughout the entire dance, not just in this moment. I would encourage the dancer to make sure that they're spotting and really whipping that head around quickly so they can create smooth, luxurious turns. I would encourage the dancer to drop that head even further and really push that leg up to have a really full embodied layout. It's the head-toe connection that allows that layout effect.

He does this by sending the left leg that was extended to be pointed on the opposite direction and this one so it can be a back flag. The climber then is able to bring his weight, center of gravity, close to the wall when making the reach. Here, the climber is leaning over to the right with the arms extended and also extending the right leg. This so that the climber is ready to do a committed pull where he then immediately would have to step up over the only foot being in place, the left foot, to go up for a dynamic move having to bring the left hand over to the edge. Right now, the climber is taking some time adjusting the grips which means that he's hesitating and can take energy away when having to engage on that power for the dynamic move. Once the climber had incorporated pressure onto the right hand accurately, the climber can lean on the right hand and quickly sense the left leg that was out on the flag to come into a high placement, crossing it over the right leg. Now once the climber applies pressure to that foot at height, then the climber can release the right foot from its place. The climber was able to send the left hand up for a reach, this one being a pinch grip. The climber then forces a squeeze and is able to apply weight by leaning back on the grip. Now in order for the climber to go for that reach, the climber's right leg has been extended and the toe was pressing against the wall. That way the climber was supported when pushing down on the right foot to gain direction when making the reach out left. Here the climber is shaking his hands and this is how the climber can warm up the hands as well as releasing any tension that may be built up from previously performing. As the climber released the right foot, he had sent the leg extended for a flag where it was initially a back flag and the climber brings it under the right hand grip so that he's able to balance the position to keep his center of gravity underneath the hold that was supported the highest. And then quickly once he gained position of the leg being extended below the right hand, the climber quickly releases the left hand to bring it into a high position. The leg extended helps the climber to shift the weight over to the highest foot as well as keeping the hips square and stay in position when making the reach. Since the climber brought the right hand for a reach, open-handed to place it on top of a lobe of the hold. This one, the climber has to remain open-handed and apply friction at the fingertips that are placed on top of the pores, meeting the hold. So now the climber has to create pressure by leaning on the hold. In order for him to power through and release some of the pressure at the hand to replace the hand to have a better friction, is the reason why the climber's left leg that was extended had to go on up in the kick so that the climber was able to release some of the pressure at the top for the adjustment. The left leg being extended, this is called flagging out, and this is so that the climber can balance over the areas of support. It also shifts the weight over to the right foot being in place. And since the climber is keeping the left leg extended, it helps the climber to keep his right side towards the wall, as the next move would have to be releasing the right hand to go up for reach. The climber is chucking up his hands. This will help the climber to absorb any sweat that may be coming from the hands as well as gaining a better grip when sustaining the holds. As the climber was going up for the reach, his left foot has come out of place. This didn't allow the climber to have completed placing the grip above the hold. So now the climber will be coming off the wall. The climber then chooses to lower his right hand to go back onto the previous hold, but this time he places the hand as a pinch as he's wrapping both sides with the hand. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet when making a foot switch. So the climber has brought the right leg that was extended to bring the right foot to be placed where the left foot is and he needs to do this where he pulls tight on the grips to release some pressure down at the feet and on this one the climber sends the right toe to come into position at the hold before releasing the left foot from its place. The climber is starting at a one hold start where he places both of the hands to the sides of the hold. This is called matching because both of the hands are in the same hold. The right hand, he's sustaining the hold at an open grip. This one, so that the climber can send the thumb underneath the hold to create more pressure at the grip as he is pinching the hold. And we can see that the right hand, he is creating extra pressure because of the knuckles bending up to apply pressure with the fingertips towards the top area of the hold. And the left hand, it's placed just with the fingertips above and the climber wraps the hand around to the side to apply pressure with the palm on the left edge of the hold. The climb will start until the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall and no longer is touching the mat. Later on, the climber is blowing off any excess chalk that's in the hands, so it doesn't cake over the hold that he will initially start on. And cake means that is when there is multiple application of layers of chalk on top of the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Unfortunately, the arm is obscured here, but because the hip was open to the left, their left hip was still facing more this direction or directly into the wall. They had to pull all the way in the right arm, almost the shoulder to be able to jump and make this big move. So we see the climber begin the attempt by sequencing their climb and pantomiming the sequence they intend to use. The more a climber does this, the more they have the climb memorized before beginning, the more successful they'll be because they're just going to be more efficient. They'll be able to identify the holes in the wall and know where their feet and hands should go rather than have to spend time looking for them. Unfortunately, they didn't have quite enough of the core tension to maintain the swing. As their body started pulling in and towards the ground, their hand came off and they come with it. So, something a climber could do there is purposely kick the wall as they're coming back in, extending one leg and stopping it against the wall to prevent the momentum from dragging them down. So good first couple moves climbers good about twisting their hips into the wall really evidenced here turning right hip in really far so they can reach up with the right hand.

I would encourage the dancer to, after they do the swooping step, they kind of turn their shoulders in and out, and it seems like their feet are struggling to catch up with them. So I would either purposefully take a beat and pause, twisting those shoulders in and out, or making sure to ground through those feet and use the hips to push you forward and back while you shake those shoulders in and out to create more fluidity of the movement as opposed to the movement, the shoulders are moving and the feet are looking stuck. Immediately I would tell the dancer to make sure that they look up and rotate those shoulders forward up and back so that they have this really beautiful presence and energy and confidence that they're exuding as soon as they start. Sometimes the dance falls flat, and the reason that it falls flat is because there's not textuality in the movement or different textures or layers or dynamic qualities of movement. So it's important to know when to melt and really over accentuate those hips and let it go slow, or versus when to hit it hard. So as the dancer grows in their technique ability in the salsa step, really thinking about the legato versus the staccato qualities will take it to the next level. I would encourage the dancer here, especially when they do this wrap around land with their leg, and then kind of roll their torso to also make sure that they're rolling those hips as well. I would encourage the dancer to send that energy down, making sure they ground their energy so then that they can twist those legs really dramatically in and out. And the audience can see that over-articulation of the twisting in the legs and in the knees.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

He could have eliminated this step by grabbing all of his utensils at the beginning of the recipe in step one. I would recommend using a fourth of a teaspoon with an egg mixture that only contains one full egg, which is actually one fourth of a cup of liquid measure. Now he has finally grabbed his flat spatula. He needed this earlier to spread out the eggs and cook them more evenly. Here you can see he is adding his chopped veg directly from the countertop, I meant from the cutting board, into the mixing bowl. However, he failed to throw away the shell of his eggs. Eggshells are actually very dirty and they contain a lot of bacteria. So when you crack an egg, you immediately want to throw it into the garbage rather than setting it on your workspace. Here he uses his cutting board with the knife attached to make very thin slices of the red tomato going lengthwise. He appears to actually have a decent skill level in slicing this thinly. However, you can see that there's a gap between his fingers and the actual blade's knife blade. He should have his knuckles pressed up against the blade of that knife so that he doesn't leave himself open for any injury. As his pan heats, he adds what appears to be a one ounce ladle full of oil. This is to grease the bottom of the pan so that the eggs don't stick while cooking. Having an open flame without any dish or pan on top of it in any kitchen setting is a safety hazard. This step of flipping the omelette over and over and over again is really unnecessary. You need to let an omelette cook on both sides, you know, one or two minutes per side until the egg mixture is cooked and that's enough. The flipping is unnecessary. Next, he turns the slices crosswise and he is attempting to chop them into a fine dice. He has chosen a red onion and it looks to be a green pepper. As he is trying to get the flat spatula underneath the entirety of the omelet, you can see that since it is uncooked on the center, he's having a very hard time getting it to stay on the spatula. As the egg hits the pan, you can see very quickly the edges of the omelet are cooking relatively fast, considering that the interior of the omelet is still extremely raw. Here he could benefit from spreading out that egg mixture into a more even layer. Now that the pan is ready, he swirls the pan in a motion to elicit the oil spreading out over the surface of the griddle pan. This is so that all of the portions of the pan are covered in oil so that when the eggs hit the pan, they will not stick. Next he is going to prepare his egg mixture and he gathers his tools to do that task which includes a cutting board and a knife that is attached to the cutting board and then his ingredients. He adds roughly one and a half teaspoons of ground paprika and that's a tremendous amount of paprika for this egg mixture, which is really only about a fourth of a cup with liquid measure. Step one of cooking an omelet is gathering all of the tools and the ingredients that you are going to use for this recipe. His next step is to season the egg mixture, which it appears he has a kosher salt here, or iodized salt, and he is using about a half of a teaspoon. He cracks his single egg into the mixing bowl directly with a spoon. He could have done this on the countertop or the edge of the mixing bowl, but this is a fairly adequate way to get the egg into the bowl without having any spillage onto the countertop. And while he is successful in turning at this time, you can see quite a bit of splatter as he turned it, which meant that his center of the omelet was very raw. Alternately, you could use butter or pan spray, any type of oil, just something that contains fat so that when the eggs cook they don't stick to the bottom of the pan. Here he is mixing his egg mixture in the mixing bowl with a spoon. I would always recommend using a fork or a whisk in this scenario since you could incorporate more egg, I'm sorry, more air into the egg mixture with a fork or a whisk and make your omelet fluffier. He has selected a flat top griddle, which is like a cast iron skillet. And here you can see as he attempts to flip the omelet, he actually tears it and rips it at this one point where he hasn't let it cook long enough and hasn't spread out in the mixture enough for it to actually be ready to flip. He mistakenly starts with step one of lighting the stove top without a pan on top.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

There's a mixture with him of short, smaller touches that are sort of under hit and then these touches that get away from him. This is another example of the ball just getting away from him and having to grab the ball with the bottom of his foot to then pull it back to then go in this direction. So he's not moving very fluidly through these cones. It's very choppy. It's very sporadic, right? So I think a challenge that he could have and something that we've done before is that you could give a player a target objective of saying if you're coming from this direction and you're dribbling this way that your hips always need to try to face forward as much as possible. And the same thing if he's coming from this way to go this way is that his hips always face forward as much as possible. You can see that those hips are facing the side or the fence here in this picture. That could help him dribble or force himself to figure out techniques to be able to dribble, to stay facing the way in which he's going and keep moving with the ball, perhaps out in front of his body more. Yeah, I liked how he started this part of the sequence where he was coming around, he started really tight to this cone, I think, which was great. But then he took a heavy touch, and that heavy touch brought him far outside the cone. You can see where he has to catch the ball and now come back a bigger distance in this direction. So I think this is really, I think this is actually like the intention of it's good. He just needs to stay as close as he can to these cones to get to there, and then he can push through that space. That would be the challenge, is that he stay tight to the cones as much as possible. This is also just something from a setup perspective that this cone is so detached from the exercise that he's working on. If he just put the cone here, like in the same spacing that's between these cones, I think that would be really helpful for him to do the exercise. You know, one thing that he could do is as he keeps going here, this could just be a continuous exercise where he goes around here and then comes back around in this direction. So we would call that like a closed chain loop. He in this case is coming from here and instead of going around this direction, he's coming here and he's stopping and he's going around that direction and sort of restarting. So I think if it was going to be a continuous exercise, he should do the first way where he just tries to keep it close to go around here. If this is going to be an exercise where he resets after he dribbles through the cones and gets to this point and resets and then does the same thing, go back in the other direction, that's another thing. It just needs to be determined at the start of the exercise. Yeah, here and just like a lack of efficiency and how you get around and keeping that ball out in front of him. The ball got kind of behind him and underneath him. And you can see here he's pulling now the ball across his body back underneath that direction. In terms of the exercise of dribbling, what we would prefer is that that ball stay slightly out in front of him the entire time if he's working on that as a skill. If he was working on skill moves or turns that were different than just dribbling around the cone with the inside or the outside of the foot, then what he's showing in this picture could be appropriate. But for this drill or this exercise, it's not something that we would want to happen. We want to keep that ball out in front of his body as much as possible. You know again a really consistent theme with him is that as he gets into this position and he tries to go back this direction is that he's over hitting the ball across his body or high and he has to grab the ball with the bottom of his foot and pull it back in this direction to then hit it in this direction. So it's inefficient in terms of the number of touches that he needs to take. So if he can be a little bit more mindful of the strength of his touch, if he's going to control it here, that it's just a soft controlling touch, so less power, and that allows him then to set up for another, a second touch to move him in this direction. That would be what I would, I think he needs to focus on doing. A lot of those errors are actually recurring with his left foot touching the ball this way as opposed to his right foot. So just something to make note that it's probably not his strong foot. Yeah, this is a great touch. I mean, inside of the foot, he chopped down on that ball with his foot, and now it's driving the ball all the way across to here where he can then move with his body and catch that ball. I like that. And you see here, his arms are out to the side. That gives extra support and balance. He's slightly bent over with that upper body. You can see that his support leg is bent, so his hips have been slightly lowered. Yeah, there's a lot of good stuff that's happening in this clip. When he brings that foot down to the ground and he chops it, though, that foot is entirely going flat on the ground. It'd be nice to see that heel up in the air and that on the ball of the foot being what's contacting the ground. So the subject is performing a cone dribbling exercise where he's just being asked to dribble through these spaces. He's going to create a figure eight and he's going to control the ball and dribble as closely and as quickly through these cones as possible with using any surface of the foot that he would like to use. One thing right away that I want to just point out is I like that he has a slight bend in this knee. He's not moving at a super fast pace so at least he has a bend in his knee. I think that would be good. He has a slight upper body lean over the ball, head down, tracking the ball. I like that there. That's pretty good. The one thing about his support foot though is it's totally contacting the ball, meaning it's flat on the ground almost completely, at least in this freeze frame or this moment. What I prefer to see is that he stay on the ball of his feet. Lift that heel off the ground, keep the ball of his foot planted on the ground. It would allow him to be a little bit more athletic in the sense of being able to push off in either direction and he can be quicker with his footwork. Yeah, I mean, this is what we don't want to have happen is the ball gets way out from him underneath him. He loses control of the ball. So now he's all tangled up, completely out of balance. And a lot of what he's doing is just very choppy as he's walking and sort of kicking this ball or dribbling this ball. You know, perhaps what could be beneficial for him would be actually to create more space in between the cones. So if he were only going to use three cones, maybe he'd double the space in between them, which would give him more grace or more space to be able to slalom through each one. I think that would probably help him given his skill set. Because right now when it's too tight, it doesn't really allow him to move all that naturally with the ball because he has to like very, very quickly, very quickly contacted in addition to take very quick steps throughout. Yeah, so again, he's using that top of the foot or the bottom of the foot, sorry, to catch the ball on top of it. This is just because he took a heavy touch in this direction here going forward as opposed to taking it through the cones and going in that body, in that direction. Part of that is just because he, the weight of that touch that he took, instead of trying to just like control it, stop it, or manipulate it this way in a single touch, he actually tried to just take like a touch forward in front of him, and then he wanted to bring a touch across, but the touch was too hard, and so now he's stuck putting this foot on the ball to pull it backwards in this direction to then move in that direction, which is just inefficient. It's slowing the whole process down at this point. So, here as he's going through these cones and he has to go back in this direction here, this is probably an inefficient way to do so, where he's essentially putting his right foot on top of the ball here. So there's no, he's not manipulating the ball in any way that's going to move it in this direction. So this way he could either pull it back or he could kind of push it across, but it's going to be hard to get it to where he wants to get to, to then continue around these cones and go from there. So I would recommend that he would try to either use the inside of his left foot that hit the ball across his body. He could use the outside of his right foot to contact it on this side as well, but any surface to get the ball here. And perhaps what would help define that for him is just selecting a surface to use and sticking to it, whether that just be only inside the feet or whether that be use the outside of the feet or the laces. If he selected a surface, it would help. So I like this as a skill that if the ball is here and because he dribbles a lot with the inside of his feet, he's moving at a walking pace, so this makes sense actually. One of the things he does is he'll use this what's called a cut catch where the ball is placed here. He'll take it across his body with that right foot by touching it with the inside of his foot and he'll catch it on this side with his left foot. It's a really useful skill when you're going through these cones, especially if the ball gets sort of caught too far to the cone here and he can't go through it like diagonally. He's got to bring it more straight across. It's a really good skill to be able to use.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So really putting energy into that performance quality. Kudos to this dancer here for being in plie and taking big gigantic steps. The dancer is about just the hair late, so I would encourage them to have more hustle for this. And also if they plied a little further and just stood a little bit wider, they would have more range of motion so they could tap that foot and get quicker with it because they have this more greater range of motion. So they'll be able to take a bigger step and move back quickly. So they won't be off the beat as they were in this beginning section. I would encourage the dancers to be more dramatic in every single one of their steps. Everything needs to just be performed bigger to have a greater dynamic quality so we can see all of those movements. I would encourage this dancer not only to be on beat, but also to have more precision in their steps so we can clearly identify when they're kicking versus when they're stepping, so we have some more precision in this basic choreography that would improve the overall look and feel of the dance. I would encourage the dancer to again do a little bit more homework about studying the music and studying the rhythm and making sure their body matches the rhythm and they're dancing on the beat. This would improve the overall quality of the movement of this basic choreography.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He wants to jump to it. It seems like he probably doesn't have to jump to it, but maybe that's just more his style. But I think if he is gonna jump for it, kind of start from this locked off position isn't the greatest. He kind of wants to sink in. Kind of drop down and then kind of pull over to this right foot and spring off the right foot instead of kind of solely doing it on his arms. So he's kind of a little bit more springy. These holds are good so he can swing around more. Looks like he's quite comfortable on them. They all look pretty big and in-cut. So he's kind of able to launch himself around, swing around pretty comfortably, which might save some energy by moving faster instead of kind of taking your time and slowly bearing down just because he is comfortable with those holds. And then by jumping he's gonna have to cut his feet so his feet do rip off So that means he's got a hold this kind of swing out And then he also has to kind of hold all that weight on those two arms that have his feet on So I don't know if this is the best idea But he does make it work But it still follows some basic technique like getting opposite pose. He's got left hand on. He's not bending that arm too much, keeping it nice and straight, but still tension. So he gets the right foot up, so that way he's opposite pose. That kind of lets him drive up and reach up with his right hand and stay kind of nicely balanced out.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You know, she's not really stepping into the pass. She's just counting on her body to, from the point of takeoff, that this is all we get in here. It's not a lot of legs initially. This doesn't look too bad, but I think that guide hand may, it just, the palm needs to stay faced in. It's doing something as it comes off the ball, which could cause a little bit of some sort of pressure here for the ball to kind of go off target. I love her shooting hand behind the ball. That looks very, very nice. Then she takes her time. Again, you're going to be defended quickly. Spread our feet just a tad here. I like how she's looking, but again, if this was a shooting drill, you don't have that time. You're going to be guarded. Again, here comes the pass, standing straight up, locked out, feet together, kind of bends over a little bit here at the... Again, we need this right hand to catch the basketball, not the left, because she's right handed. Let's go get it. Let's go get this pass. Be aggressive here. Here, she didn't even move to get it. And again, see her hands? She's right-handed shooter, so she's kind of using the opposite hand to backstop it. We need this right hand to be behind the ball and the left hand on the side. So let's switch up our hands here, even when we catch it. Bend our knees, drop our hips, go get this pass. Again, here's her release. It looks a little flat here, if you will. See how the the arms kind of flat and set up? I think she's snapping the wrists. Again, the guide arm just needs to stay in there and not come be jerked back. Again, I really feel like that left toe is pointing to the sideline. We need to turn that left hip in so it's facing the basket, the baseline that you're shooting at. Let's get that arc up. Again, she's dribbling it. For the sake of this drill, it's more of a catch and shoot sort of drill. You don't really have time to dribble it. If it was a free throw, that would be fine. But you dribble it, you're defended. She looks down, takes her eyes off the target. So again, let's speed this up. Let's be a catch and shoot kind of girl here. Here's the shot. Good extension of that right elbow. Uh, can't really see. I think there's a good follow through here. So that looks good. Beautiful extension of the hips. I think the feet are a little bit close together. Um, she is getting off the ground, but really didn't step into the pass. This is all from a stand still position. I'm really not sure what this guide hand or arm is doing. Looks like she's kind of pulled it back really tight, curled that wrist in. We just want it to be in a natural position out here, with the palm facing the other arm. Here's the shot. Again, see how the feet are touching. We want them apart, balanced, cushioned on the landing. Hold that follow-through more out in front of you instead of up. Again, that follow through comes across the body, again pops that elbow out, get that elbow in, let's square up that left leg. Again, here's her landing. We'd love to see more of a balanced landing. Drop the hips. Settle leaning back here. Let's hold that follow-through out. See how it pops out? That elbow pops out. We want it to be more in line. And any of this little extra movement can throw off the ball going to the basket. Again, she lets that ball hit her all the way in the chest. Again, just not a ready, ideal ready position to receive a pass. And that's a big part of being a great shooter, is what are you doing in preparation to catch? Here, the feet are kind of flat-footed here, left foot's that way, right foot's this way, we're locked out here, we're bent over. Not really sure where the basket is at this point. See how we're looking down? Again, let's have a smoother follow-through, instead of jerking the arm up and back. More balanced landing, but you can see this left foot, how it's pointed out. That left knee is pointed to this sideline over here. We want to square our entire body, every bit of it, square to the basket, facing the basket. Again, nice. This is not bad. Ball coming off the pads of these fingers. I don't even know what the guide hand's doing. We don't really want it to move. We just want it to stay, like if it was on the side of the ball like it's supposed to be, that palm would still just be facing in. Here it looks like it might have been in the shot just a little. It's not in the shot, but it's doing something here to throw off the balance of the body. Again, let's square this left hip up, this left ankle, knee. I like how the ball's leaving that shooting hand. Again, here's the shot, the ball's leaving these fingers. That looks good. Let's keep this guide hand more up here in line with the right arm instead of jerking it back. Pretty good little lift here from just going up from a stationary position. I think she could get more legs if she would meet this pass and step into it to shoot. Here's the shot. Trying to, here's extending the hips. Looks like that left leg's kind of, knees kind of turn to the sideline. Let's keep all our entire body square to the basket. Here on the follow-through, it looks like that shooting arm kind of goes across the body, which sends that elbow out. We want that elbow in. Keep that shooting arm in line with the flight of the basketball. Again, that guide hand sort of jerks back. Not sure if that's a factor here. Again, we just, we really just don't want it to be involved with the shot itself. Here's the shot. Again, would love to see this follow-through be a little more smooth and in line with the trajectory of the basketball. Hold this palm of the guide hand, the left hand, facing this arm. It kind of seems like it curls back. Not sure what it's doing to the shot itself. But here she's got some nice lift. I love her verticality. She's got really good extension of the hips here. Again, feet are farther apart, which is nice to see. Looks like she's a little more square to the basket. I like how she's looking up over the ball. Looks like she's shooting hands behind the ball, the left hand on the side. Here the shooter's shooting a 15-foot jump shot. She took a dribble. I really, it's not a free throw. I think we could do without the dribble. We need to just shoot it. Spread these feet a little bit more. I love how she's bending the knees and dropping the hips. She's looking over the top of the basketball, which is nice. So far, so good. Again, she dribbles it. Not what I'm looking for in this jump shooting drill. It's not a free throw. That's a whole nother thing. We need to catch and shoot because you don't have time to dribble. You're gonna be defended. You look down at the ball, taking our eyes off our target. Plus, she's locked out here. We need to be low and be soft and bend our knees and drop our hips. Get low to the ground. Again, here comes the pass. Is she ready? Can she back up and really step into this pass? Whether it's a two foot stop or a one-two stop, plant and elevate. Here she's kind of locked out here. Feet are stationary. She's kind of bent over a little bit, but let's go get this pass before a defender steps in and steals it. Good. Here she begins to lift it. Again, let's spread those feet a little because that way we can at least push off and get a little bit more of a lift here. Here's the shot. Again, she really brings those feet close together. Let's start with having a really shoulder-width stance, balanced, feet apart. She does bend her knees, drops her hips here. I love how she eyes the target over the top of the ball. That looks good. Again, here's the landing, little weights a little bit back on her heel. Well, she's on the balls of her feet, but the weight, you can see the body's not in line here with the knees. Let's drop the hips, bend our knees on this landing, hold this follow-through out so it follows the flight of the ball. She kind of pops it up. And again, it just kind of probably throws off the rotation, the spin, if you will, on the basketball. Here's the landing, balls in flight. Again, a little bit of an off-balance landing. You see a lot of the weight's on that right leg. Let's land with our weight kind of evenly distributed across both knees and ankles and feet. Hold that follow throughout. She kind of jerks that arm back, if you will. You can see it right here. Let's keep it out there, nice and smooth, one motion. Here comes the shot. She does bend her knees, but again it's all just get from the knee bend, not a really explosive step through here. Feet are a little bit together, left foot's pointed out. We need to again square her entire body to the basket or to the baseline. This, this looks good here. She's looking over top of the ball at her target. Here she begins to extend her body. She goes up on the balls of her feet. Good extension of the hips here. I believe the shooting hand is here behind the ball. The guide hand comes off. The palms kind of facing the wall. Love to see that the palm of the hand facing more of the basketball.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Because of the bowings that they're choosing for this piece, they're using a lot of bow to get back to the frog. They could come up with different bowings that would make it sound more coherent and have better bow distribution. When approaching the frog, their wrist is coming up a bit which is resulting in them losing some of their sound. They can try to keep their wrist as flat as possible so they can keep as much weight into the bow as possible. They start playing some chords using two fingers to play on two different strings. Again, this is a section when they're playing at the tip that they could actually have a lot more articulation if they pronated more with their hand and possibly brought up their arm to have more leverage into the bow. In their left hand, they often have fingers that are flying up when they have the higher fingers down. This results in more tension in the hand, but also is just inefficient. To help with better coordination, they should make sure that their fingers are as close as possible to the fingerboard, and also being held down if it's a lower finger and a higher finger is being played. Let's start playing some fast chords. Again, this is another section where they're playing out the tip and not getting the best sound that they could. In this section, they could try to play a little bit closer to the frog, but if they wanted to play closer to the tip, they just need to make sure that they're pronating more into the bow. The violin starts to rush here a little bit. Then you make sure that they have a metronome on, just to help their rhythm. The violist never really actually gets close to playing to the frog, which could be their preference for this section, but I've noticed also they're not utilizing their upper arm. They can use it to bring it forward a little bit more so they can use the full bow. The valance is using four bows to get a four sound. Intonation is not great when they're playing this handshape. They can try to bring their arm a little bit further around and have their pinky a little bit more curved to help with the handshape. Additionally, they just need to make sure that they practice these chords slowly and make micro adjustments until the chord sounds in tune. This shift that they just did happens a little bit too fast, resulting in it being out of tune. They can make sure that they just practice very slowly to make sure that they know where they need to go. And then when playing, make sure that they take enough time to feel like they are relaxed to land the note properly. Again, this is another example with their first fingers flying up while the rest of the fingers are down playing. This is creating more tension in the hand, but especially when they have to play the first finger again, they're creating more distance that the first finger will have to travel in order to play the note that they're going to. Again, this is another section where they're staying out into the tip of the bow. They're getting a decent sound, but they could get even better if they were to raise their arm a little bit and pronate more to get a little bit more weight into the string. They're trying to do some vibrato here at this really high note, but their finger is flat which will result in them not getting a lot of range of motion. If they can bring their arm a little bit further around so they have more plane on the tip, then they can get more of a range of motion on the vibrato that will come through. During the string crossing section, they're using a lot of bow vertically to get from one place to another. This is resulting in the string crossings to be really quite sharp. They can make sure that they have more of a horizontal approach and balance more between the strings using less bow. This will result in being more clean, but they'll also have more control. During this section, the chords that they're playing are not in tune. It would be good for them just to isolate each chord and make sure that they're playing them as in tune as possible, and then transition from one chord to the next, doing this as slowly as possible so that they are not making any mistakes. Again, the left hand here isn't getting as much clarity as it can. Because of the flying fingers, there's extra coordination that's not necessary. They should just practice very slow movements, trying to make sure that all of their fingers are close to the fingerboard, or down when they can be. They're starting to rush during this section. This is a section that provides a lot of technical difficulties, but they should always remind to feel grounded in the tempo that they're playing. It'd be good for them just to practice this slowly with the metronome. Again, another example of their fingers being really far away from the fingerboard. This makes it extremely more difficult for them playing this really fast passage. It also ends up being cleaner and sound more efficient if they were closer to the fingerboard. They make a couple of mistakes here and then they get back on track. Again, this is another example where their fingers are getting really high off the fingerboard, especially in a really fast passage like this. This is making them have more effort for them, but also starts to become a bit uncoordinated. They should just try to keep their fingers as close as possible to the fingerboard. They get a nice clear sound here at the tip because their arm is a little bit higher and they're able to get more leverage into their hand. They just did an expressive shift up the string. This is another section where they're playing at the tip that I feel like they could use a little bit more articulation. Even if it's a legato smooth note, they could use more weight just to feel like the sound gets up more. They should have more pronation in their hand and they can actually use their arm to come up a little bit more to help get more of that leverage. Again, during this section, because of the violinist's flying fingers, they're not getting the best coordination. I also believe since they've been playing for a while and doing this, their left hand is probably getting tired and not being able to be as efficient or clear as possible. They're also getting a really nice sound here because their bow is very parallel with the bridge. This section just sounds a bit frantic. It'd be good for them just to practice this very slowly. When playing this legato stroke, they start off a little bit slow and then they get into the speed of the bow that they want. They should practice so that they start right from that new down bow the speed that they want. The violinist is vibrating here a bit. The vibrato is really quite narrow. You can try to open it up a little bit more by getting more range of motion on the fingertip. You can see on their bull hold that their thumb is squeezing a bit. They can make sure that they are playing on more of the tip of the thumb and have more of a rounded, curved joint around the thumb. The violinist is using their bow to break up these chords by playing the first two notes here and then moving their bow over here very quickly to play the rest of the chords. This ascending line starts to sound a little bit out of tune. You can see also from their fingers starting to play a little bit more flat. This starts losing the structure of the hand. If they can play more with their fingertips, they'll have a more dependent, reliable shape of the hand that will allow them to play more in tune consistently. Here, they're not super coordinated with their left hand. They kind of falter and make some mistakes. It would really serve them well to have their fingers as close as possible to the fingerboard, so whenever they're making transitions, they have less movement to make. They're using a good amount of coordination between the bow and the left hand here. They're using a good combination of using shorter amounts of bow for short notes and then a longer amount of bow for the longer notes. They could still have some more articulation, I feel like they just need more pronation in their hand. The violinist is trilling between two fingers. They just did an expressive shift where they shifted downward and had a little bit of a slide for more of an expressive sound. Again, this is another section where they're playing at the tip and they're not getting a lot of articulation. Their bow hold looks a bit neutral. They can try to rotate from their arm more into the bow so that they get more articulation and weight into the tip. These chords are happening a little bit too fast. This is the conclusion of the piece, and for it to be more grand, they could spend a little bit more time on these chords. While playing out the tip, to get more articulation, you can try raising their arm a little bit more to get more leverage through the hand and get weight through the bow so they get more articulated sound. The violinist pulls back their hand to do a little bit of a mini shift here. When doing a glissando in a romantic repertoire, in this case, they can try to actually do a little bit more so it sounds more purposeful.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So here she's doing a body roll, really good job. It goes through her whole body, her knees are bent. And just really good job overall. The dancer is starting with a salsa front and back and she is stepping forward on her left leg and stepping back with that left leg. She's doing a good job rotating her arms around and using her hips and also has a nice spin in her knees. So watching this performance, it was just a really, really good performance. I could see this being taught. I could see this as a Zumba class. Like, she really just captured what the piece needed to be and just did a really, really great job. So this is a really great example. So here, this is a really good job just in control and body control. She first did a turn over here and then moved to this side of the room, and then did another spin and turn and she was able to stop herself right on the beat. So really good job just controlling her body and spotting and getting across the room with this movement. So here the dancer does a twist. She goes up on her toes as you see there, and then she twists her hips over to the left and then back down.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Picking and finger picking and normal picking is quite challenging at the same time.

As she gets to the top of the arpeggio sequence, she raises the volume a little bit, and then as she comes back down, she gets a little bit softer. So there is a bit of a musical phrase and an overlying phrase structure as she plays these exercises. So she's still being quite musical even though she's working on something that is very technical. As she's playing the arpeggios up and down the keyboard, she's keeping her forearms and her elbows in a very neutral position. They sometimes have to move a little bit side to side, but they mostly maintain this straight shape in her arms. And so she's able to switch between hand positions with ease, and she's not doing any extra movement or moving her elbows out in any kind of weird way that would prevent her from executing the arpeggios quickly. As she is expanding her hand to play these arpeggios up and down the fingerboard, she's still keeping that relaxed, curved finger position. And as she moves from hand position to the next one and back down, you don't see a lot of her hand changing shape. It's still keeping that same shape, and she's still keeping her fingers really close to the fingerboard or to the keyboard, and she's playing with a lot of accuracy. She's sitting with a relaxed position. Her shoulders don't appear to be tense at all. She's just keeping them at a neutral position and her forearms don't have any excess tension. They look very relaxed and in a very neutral position. So that helps her to be able to execute these fast notes at this speed. As she has to tuck her thumb underneath the rest of the fingers, she does it so quickly and so smoothly that you barely notice that's happening. But as she changes those finger patterns, as she's going up for the arpeggios, her thumb is going exactly where it needs to go underneath the other fingers, and then propelling her whole hand forward to play the next few notes. As she's descending this arpeggio pattern, she accidentally played a G natural and a G sharp here. This is a very, very hard to see mistake, but you could hear it. It's just when she's going this fast tempo, it's really hard to pick out. If she's playing this scale, it has a few black keys in the pattern, so she has to adjust her hand position in order to get some of the black keys. Previously she was playing scales with all the white keys, but now she's adding some black keys in there, so she has to do a different set of fingerings, and she's playing that set of fingerings accurately with the correct fingers. She just played a four octave scale with both hands and she played it at a really fast tempo. But even though she played it at a really fast tempo, you could hear every note really cleanly, really evenly. There's a lot of clarity in her playing. This is really hard to do at that fast of a speed and for her to be able to change hand positions accurately and use all the accurate fingerings at that tempo is very well done. As she's playing the descending scale, her left hand as it goes down is not quite perfectly in sync with her right hand, and that happens more on the descending patterns. On the ascending patterns, her fingers are really well synchronized, but on the descending they're not quite perfectly matched up. Sometimes one or two notes sticks out a little bit, but this is a very subtle, very hard to notice thing. She's playing the scale in thirds and so her hands have to get very close to each other to be able to play the scale in this pattern and so that requires a bit of coordination to make sure your fingers don't run into each other but she's navigating that really beautifully and you can hear each hand very clearly. As she's going up the keyboard, her hand shape looks very similar throughout. Even when she has to change hand positions, she's not moving her wrist. She's keeping these wrists nice and neutral. And as she changes from one hand position to the other, it's so smooth when her fingers cross over that you don't really notice her hand changing much position at all. And so this shows a real mastery of ease of technique. She's using a rounded hand shape with both of her hands and her fingers are curved throughout so that helps her to use the fingertips of her fingers to be able to play with clarity.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I would encourage this dancer to take a pause because they have a lot of great energy, but sometimes they're on the music and sometimes they aren't. I think there's opportunity for this dancer to improve this movement by making sure that they incorporate their hips. A lot of times they use their feet and their shoulders and their arms and sometimes even their ribcage, but their hips were very stationary throughout this entire movement. Again, I will repeat my previous comments about making sure that they're on the music and on the beat. I would encourage this dancer to plie even further to increase their mobility and agility in this movement.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So you can see here he's out of balance, his arms are working hard and we would want him to be using the inside of his foot to play this pass because it keeps more accuracy. Unfortunately this isn't the case because he's having to reach and make his leg as long as possible just to generate contact on the ball. Instead, we would want the player to either use the inside of his left foot, step here with his right and come across with the inside of the left so he's in a natural anatomical position. And then he's got himself in line with the ball and has planted his non-kicking foot appropriately by the side of the ball and swung through the inside of the foot. All in all, a really good moment. Players receive the ball with the outside of their right foot but they've moved the ball backwards. This isn't where we want the ball to go because they're trying to play the next pass. By moving the ball down here, they have to run backwards and around the ball. We would instead want that first touch to place the ball in this area, so the player simply shuffles and steps into the ball for the next action. and his left foot has moved just as the right foot has planted he's got himself in line with the ball quickly and is striking through the ball with the inside of the left foot and his eyes are focused on the ball as he's receiving it. I like how the player has adjusted to the path so the ball has been passed inside and the player has shifted their body weight across to make contact with the ball and has got in line with it. It's a good way of getting control of the ball. Players made contact on the ball, but again, too near the front. This is going to reduce the speed and reduce the accuracy of the touch. players receiving the ball with the outside of their right foot we want their hips to be turned more so they are slightly more sideways on so right shoulder pointing more towards where the ball is coming from, the left shoulder rotated round this will help them use the outside surface a lot easier Or we would want him to turn this right foot and use the outside of it so that he can push the ball to the outside and put the ball in the position that it needs to be. Players receive the ball with the inside of their right foot, attempting to move the ball from the right to left across their body. Standing leg is too straight, we want this leg to be bent more and they're also taking the ball very early in front of them. We would want the ball to be controlled around here so that the ball is closer to the body and the leg becomes closer to the body and therefore it helps the player become more balanced. Mae'r chwaraewr wedi cael y ball, ond mae'r defnydd o'r ffoc yn ni allu ei helpu i gael y ball i'r ardal yma lle mae angen y cyntaf ychydig. Good action from the player, like how he stays in line with the ball. As he received it, move the ball into the correct space. Body weight leaning to the left side, so that as he made contact with the ball, his body weight was already travelling in that direction, which helps him speed up. This contact point on the foot looks a little too towards the toe end. We'd want this toe to be turned and make a flatter surface to create a better passing tool to play back. The player is playing a one-touch pass with the inside of the foot. Eyes on the ball, which is good. He's followed it all the way into his body. Inside of the foot is presented to the ball. We want this left toe to be up more, so there was a bit more of an angle on that foot. Therefore, the toe doesn't drag on the floor and get bent around easily, which would decrease the accuracy of the pass. Mae'r p\u00ealwr yn mynd o'r b\u00eal i'r dde i'r dde, mae'n gweithio'n iawn. Mae'r b\u00eal yn lle perffaith fel y gallwn ei chwarae'n pas gyda'i phosib.

But overall she's able to stay connected, particularly to the tempo of the music, while maintaining the integrity of the movement. As the dancer begins with a basic kind of stationary salsa step, she's able to connect to the rhythm, particularly through the use of her footwork and her lower body in general. And while she's engaging her arms choreographically, they're a bit stiff, which I feel is holding her back from connecting to the rhythm. If she were to loosen up through her shoulders and her spine in general, as well as through her pelvis, but particularly through her torso, she'd be able to move her arms more fluently and introduce some interesting movement dynamics. As the dancer continues through some basic salsa steps that locomote her through the space and turn her around herself, she continues to maintain consistency in her inclusion of the arms. She's able to really clearly perform choreography with the arms, though again would benefit from loosening up through the shoulders and the spine a bit more. And she continues to maintain consistency over her hold over the movement vocabulary and rhythmic embodiment. While she doesn't fully embody the rhythm because of that stiffness, particularly in her upper body and the lack of grounding, she is able to maintain consistency with the tempo of the music without falling off rhythm in the transitional moments. As the dancer begins to locomote through the space with a basic cross step, moving side to side, she continues to struggle with a bit of stiffness in her arms and upper body, though I have to commend her for keeping her upper body engaged fairly consistently. However, this stiffness is really keeping her from deeply embodying the rhythm.

We see that her left leg is bent. It's also not exactly at her side. So her leg should really be a bit more behind her and in an exact straight line instead of bent as it is right here. She can make this movement bigger by incorporating her hips and her shoulders instead of just tapping her feet and bringing her arms forward. The dancer now remembers the arm choreography and incorporates it, but her arm never reaches a fully straight position. They're very graceful as we see she's holding her hand with ease, but it never actually reaches the appropriate position which should be fully extended in front of her. The dancer's weight is on her toes when she does this basic dance step, so she's able to move forwards to the center and backwards again to the center with great ease because her weight is distributed on her toes. Her heels are up in the air, so she's able to pick her feet up and transfer directions very quickly and easily. The dancer has slight chest action when she pumps her chest forward, which is okay, but if she's going to do this and she should be doing it even larger, making the movement even bigger, so it seems apparent right now how she's doing it's very subtle and almost looks a bit awkward or just not purposeful if she meant to do it or if her chest just released forward as a result of momentum. So if she's going to pump out her chest, that's a great way to make the movement bigger, but then she has to make this very apparent and really pump it out forward to a larger extent. The dancer keeps her shoulders pressed down even when she's bringing her arms both upward and that's great because we're able to see her neck clearly and she looks tall and elongated so this is something that she's doing very well here. Something that the dancer needs to watch out for is how she's opening her rib cage here too much. We see that her spine is arched. It's on a straight line and it's mostly arched because her rib cage is opened. Each side of it is opened. And instead of her releasing her chest forward and opening her rib cage, she should aspire for the opposite. So her rib cage should actually be closing towards her center, towards her belly button so that her back isn't creating this arch that it's doing right here. But in an ideal world, it would actually be in a straight line. The dancer is sliding her feet open as she goes horizontally or moves horizontally. However, the slide that she is doing is very small in width. She'd benefit more if she traveled further and made this a grander step that covered more surface area of the ground. This arm positioning that she is exhibiting here is great. Her arms are completely straight and then she's bent at the wrist. This, she was able to do this very quickly and that's wonderful. The dancer missed the arm choreography as she moved to her left side, her arms remained down. However, her right arm should have been extended forward to the front. This is just a mistake she did in forgetting the arm choreography here. The dancer's hand movement here is very graceful. She always has one hand higher than the other, and this alternates depending on which foot she's stepping on. So here we see she's stepping with her left foot, so her right arm is higher in the air than her left arm. And the way that she is transferring which hand is higher or lower, she's doing very gracefully. None of it is stiff, and it's very much so has a sense of flow.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It's just going off. It's just kind of like dry firing a bow. It's all that energy's going nowhere. That's kind of just recoiling up his body and just pulling himself off the wall and it's just a waste of energy and it's actually kind of hindering his upper mobility too because it's kind of pulling him back now or away from the wall. So right off the bat he kind of places his foot and jumps immediately into this next move What's just in general is just not a good idea because You want to get on a show control for a couple seconds on any climb? That's kind of what the rules would be But by doing so his whole kind of right foot is kind of not in the right position He's just starting from position of really just a position of not being in control Maybe it makes the first move easier to kind of jump into it, but He's not coming from a balance point and so his whole body position is just off from the very moment he leaves the ground Again, kind of does this kind of jumpy foot swap. You can see his left leg kind of already falling out from the wall. His arms may be nice and straighter, but his whole hips and lower body is really having a struggle.

So one thing that separates a beginner from an advanced is an advanced dancer would have just kept on going, would have figured it out, improvised until they got back on the music. So I think she could have really done that if she really focused on not stopping because when you perform, you can't always stop the show and keep on going. So I think a little improvising would have definitely helped to get her back on track. So the dancer starts stepping forward and back. She does a good job keeping the knees nice and loose, stepping forward and back on her toes, then also rolling her arms around and just keeping the light energy of the music. Here she does a little, what I would call a little Zumba football run, where she's kind of tapping her feet in place. For this movement, it's really great that her knees are bent. Maybe she can just roll her arms a little bit and really shake from, really stepping on her toes as fast as possible, and then that will then affect the rest of her body as it shakes and moves.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They should make sure that they practice this at a slower tempo. It also might be beneficial for them for their performance tempo to be a little bit lower so they can focus on accuracy. The pianist has a really nice relaxed flowing feel in the left hand which is allowing this musical phrase to be really natural. Again, this is another example of the great articulation this pianist uses. They're getting into the key and out of the key very quickly for this short articulation. If this section starts to rush just very slightly, it would be good for them to check this with a metronome. The pianist has really great coordination here. It's very fluid and they're keeping their hands very close to the keyboard which is allowing them their most control. The pianist is also using the tips of their fingers, which is allowing them to get more articulation and control in these faster notes. When playing these faster notes, the pianist is keeping their hand very close to the keyboard, which allows them to be more efficient. The pianist is utilizing their forearm motion to help them get their hand down to this part of the keyboard. The pianist starts to slow down, creating a ritardando. The pianist is using their forearms slightly to go back and forth with these notes. They're using a bigger muscle group to help them be more efficient. Again, this is another example of how efficient this pianist's hands are. They're very close to the keyboard and they're using a curved hand with the fingertips being playing on the keys. This is allowing me to play this very fast section with a lot of clarity. The balance between the hands here is really nice. They have really great control. The pianist uses more weight in these chords to create a very powerful sound. The pianist is using more of a fluid motion with their wrist and arm to help them get around the keyboard and create this very fluid sound. The pianist is starting to lose a bit of coordination here. It'd be good for them just to practice this very slowly, just so they make sure they know where all their notes are. The pi\u00e8ce is using this nice motion of coming off the keyboard really quickly and getting some space, then coming back down to create this very short articulation. The left hand is starting to rush a little bit here. It'd be good for them just to isolate this hand by itself and play with the metronome so they have more control. They're not getting as much articulation in the left hand as they could. They're using a lot of their wrist motion. It could be helpful for them to feel like they're leading more with their elbow and upper arm. The pianist is using a lot more weight into the keys playing these chords, which is creating this very rich sound. The pianist puts more weight into this last chord to create a louder sound. They're losing some articulation from some of these notes. They might have more of a horizontal approach here. It'd be good to make sure that they have a lot more weight in their elbow to make sure that they can get a little bit further into the keyboard. The piano is keeping a very even tempo. It's very steady. The PS holds the key a little bit longer for this longer note. To get a longer legato note in the right hand, spend more time in the key.

However, she could just use some additional clarity on the transition from the box step into this jumping lunge, which throws her off rhythm slightly. And I think just some additional rehearsal would help her to refine this transition. As the dancer performs this turn around herself, she demonstrates that she has an understanding of the movement technique here. She's able to spot her head, which is helping her to maintain stability through this turn, as well as helping her to perform the turn as quickly and efficiently as the music is demanding. She's also got a nice clear shaping of the arms above head, and overall is keeping a nice soft bend in the knees, which is helping her again to move quickly and efficiently and with clarity. As the dancer begins with a basic salsa step that's locomoting her through the space horizontally, she demonstrates that she has an understanding of the movement vocabulary, even if at a basic level. She's able to find some clarity in her footwork as well as the choreography of her arms. However, she would benefit from paying more attention to the movement dynamics and the refinement of her arm choreography in particular. She also maintains a nice soft bend in her knees that would benefit from bending more deeply and dropping the pelvis back to be more grounded in her movement, which would thus activate a more clear and dynamic range of motion in the pelvis. As the dancer performs a stationary step touch movement, she demonstrates that she has an understanding of how to change her movement dynamics throughout a piece of choreography. Here she performs a more percussive staccato movement, which is demonstrated in the rhythmic embodiment of her body. She, however, could just benefit from some clarity here, but overall this demonstrates that she's working at a bit more of an above-beginner understanding of the movement vocabulary as well as technique. As the dancer transitions into a basic salsa step which locomotes her forwards and backwards in the space, she begins to gain a bit more confidence and connect more deeply to the rhythm of the music. She finds a lot of clarity in her footwork, maintains a nice soft bend in her knees while activating a soft yet appropriate range of motion in her pelvis, and incorporating her arms more clearly choreographically.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So the arms become a tool, or a kind of navigator to where the rest of the body can flow to. I would encourage the dancer, even as they're doing this kind of transition cha-cha step, salsa step to the side and to the front and back, to not throw that away, to give that the same attention to detail and energy that they gave the rest of the dance. This dancer does a really good job at making sure that they're precise. I would encourage them to ground a little bit more so we can see that hip articulation. I encourage the dancer to make sure they have a period at the end of the movement and be more grounded so they can be able to cut across space as well as have great hip articulation. That was a really lovely movement of how they incorporated their head all the way down to their feet and notice how their fingertips are even engaged. Sometimes the dancer tends to cut their movement short, so making sure that they flow through the entire phrase and don't cut any movement off to finish the movement before heading to the next movement.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And he does this while the swing momentum, where once the climber had cut out feet and the feet were coming back onto the wall, then the right hand that was on the lobe of the pinch or of the area of the hold has been brought up to come into place into this safe grip. The climber right now has brought his left foot to come into place next to the right. Now the climber is matching with three limbs on the same hold, all of them being pulling onto the same edge. This one the climber needs to make sure that he distributes the weight well and applies pressure onto both of the feet so that the climber is able to release the right hand from its place to bring the right hand into a match at the hold down below. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet. Most importantly because the climber is positioned horizontally. So the climber needs to make sure that he makes an accurate foot positioning as it is not the normal of being positioned when it's down. And if it was done by feel, he might miss the foot placement to be correct. So the climber sends the left foot to come into match at the right foot. And it's because the climber will be making a foot switch. So he would apply first pressure onto the left toe to press into the hold before the climber releases the right toe from its place. Here the climbers left hand has moved two moves consecutively. When he makes the first move that's a move but when he does it again this is called bumping. But this one before he bumps this is now considered another move because the climber did take some time below to adjust his center of gravity. Since he was unstable he needed to find a way of balancing over the right foot. The balance of the right foot was because the climber needed to make sure that his places of support were solid before he moved the left hand up for the reach. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet, especially if he's going to be doing a foot switch. So in this one the climber has brought the right leg that was extended, which was out on a flag. This was out on a flag before because the climber was placing weight onto the left toe to keep him in balance, but quickly sends the right foot to come into place at the same hold. In order to release the left foot, the climber must apply pressure on the right foot that came into place before releasing the left foot from its hold. The climber starts until the climber is no longer standing on the mat and once gets to feet position onto the wall. Now the climber is placing the weight over the areas where he has contact with the wall then the climber starts. As we can see the climber once placed the left hand onto the jug, this one being positive. The climber's left foot has to slip out of the wall. Now the climber is forcefully swinging out of the wall and this is called cutting feet. Now the climber must be able to sustain the swing by pulling hard on the grips, potentially pulling onto a slight pull up, this one, so that the climber is able not to slip off the holds. As the climber glances over to what the next hold he has to go at reach, the climber brings the left foot into place at the big foothold that he had remained for his right foot being in place but sends the left foot to come to a match, meaning both limbs on the same hold. In this one, the climber will have to release the left pinch to go up for that next hold since it's the one that is located the lowest. And in order to do this, the climber will release the right foot to be extended so he only applies pressure onto the highest foot being the one on the left to make an easy transition. Once the climber was able to reach and secure the right grip, the climber intentionally releases the right foot, where the climber has no feet for a few seconds, and this is called cutting feet. The climber then had to apply extra pressure at the grips to avoid a forceful swing, and quickly engages the core in order to make a foot placement, first with the left, and the climber then quickly adjusts to set the right foot to come into a high placement, which helps him be positioned when making the next move. Here the climbers toes or foot placement have slipped out of the hold. As we can see the climber was trying to release the right hand and the feet came off the edge because the climber wasn't extending the leg to drop the weight to keep the foot in place. It's important that the climber extends the legs so that he doesn't release any pressure on them when transferring the hand over to the last hold. This is called a bath hang so the climber needs to first extend the legs to secure the foot placement and potentially even try to raise the heels more so that the climber is able to touch the top area of the hold in order to secure the foot placement. The climber is shaking his hands and it will help the climber to warm up the hands as well as releasing any tension that had been built up. The climber is able to walk over the right hand to the left side of the hold, sustaining the edge every time that it gets walked over. And the climber was able to release pressure on the right hand because of the left hand placement onto the jug. Now the climber has made a space for the right foot to come into place into the hold and sends the toe to be surfaced with the edge. And the toe is actually further in so that the climber is able to pull on the toe when placing pressure onto the foot so the toe can catch with the edge. The climber can, the body extended this one so the climber can sustain his swing and keep the body still in order to quickly engage the core to make a high foot placement. Now the foot placement is towards the left side of the hold which he will be pushing to the right in order for him to gain height going on the opposite direction to the left since we see the left hand coming out of place for the next move. As we can see the left leg is not in place and this one the climber will be using it as a flag. Keeping the leg extended will help the climber to keep his center of gravity to get close to the wall when he hangs and would help the climber also to bring the hip in towards the wall as well as the shoulder when going up for the reach as his reach will be on to the left side. As we can see the climber send his right hand up to a reach to be placed on top of a lobe where the climber sends the hand open-handed and cups it in order to sustain the grip and apply friction onto the hold in order to apply pressure. And it leans on the hold once he secures the grip to apply weight. As we can see in order for the climber to go up to the hold he had to press on his right foot, the one being in position, and has brought the knee inwards so that the climber's right side is close to the wall, helping the climber having an easier reach. The climbers next move is up to a pinch hold where he sends the left hand to be placed with the fingers onto one side and the thumb on the other so that the climbers able to squeeze the hold and the climber must bring his weight onto the grip by leaning back. As we can see the climbers is starting at a one hold start where he places both of the hands on the same hold Both of the hands on the same hold. This is called matching. So the climber is matching the hold by attempting to do a pinch with each hand to sustain the grip The climber once he gets positioned for getting to start on the wall, he will then extend the arms to transfer over weight to the grips", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She steps in place, does a few steps in the same part of the room, and really she should be doing steps that are crossing around in a box or in a square. She is still looking to the side of the room. She's starting now again to look to the side of the room instead of forward. The last two arm swipes she did, the last one she did with her left arm, going to the right side of the room and now what she's doing with her right arm to the left side of the room are much better. She straightens her arm completely and she leads it with force and energy. The dancer cuts this last arm swipe that she's doing with her left arm That's meant to be straight and traveling on an arc around to the left side of the room. She cuts it short So she's already bending her arm here. It was straight at one point before this. So that's very good But she should be finishing this step completely spanning the room horizontally Until the next step begins she's anticipating the next step beginning and so she cut this movement a little short and doesn't complete it The dancer doesn't complete this last step with her arm upward She cuts it short similarly to how before she cut short her arm movement when she was supposed to be horizontally panning Through the space she needs to work on completing all of her steps, especially the last one in a series Whether or not she remembers what the next step is supposed to be She should still be completing all steps that she's doing And not anticipating the next step or worrying about if she knows it or not This focus with her eyes looking straight ahead, it's much better. This is where her head should be looking. She's not concentrating in the gap in the curtain to the mirror where her teacher is. She's looking straight ahead past her hand. So this is this is great focus and this is where she should have been before and now where she should remain moving forward. The dancer tends to peek to the side of the room towards the towards when it's getting close to Her transition to the next series of steps. So this is the last step she's doing before she starts To complete a new series of steps and so she tends to look to the side of the room Trying to get some clarity trying to get some focus or sorry not getting focused. She's not focused She's trying to get a clue from her teacher as to what the next part of the routine is She really has to work on her memory so that her head isn't Tilting to the side like this and that she remains focused in the front of the room The dancer takes her first step forward. It really should be in place. So this is showing me that perhaps she doesn't know some of the choreography as well as she should. I might struggle a bit with memory. The dancer now lifted her leg with more energy. Her knee reached higher up in terms of level. It got higher in the space and it was also more to her side and she did lift it up with more emphasis on the musical cue when the vocalist made a loud noise is when her knee went up. So now she's back in the sequence where she's supposed to be and she also executed that step more with more cleanliness. It was more it was neater so she just has to work on her memory so that she can then follow through with her execution because when her memory is suffering also her execution or coordination are suffering. The dancers forgetting the sequence she is often still looking to the side of the room But she's not dancing fully like here. She lifts her right foot off the ground, but she only lifts it To a slight degree. It's not off the ground much And she doesn't lift her knee fully up to the side. It's low Because she's not completing all her movements because she is either forgetting them or not feel unconfident enough to assert herself Into the movement The dancer has great shoulder movement here. We see that her shoulders are on an angle. She's rotating or alternating each shoulder up and down through space, engaging them so that it's not only her feet moving and her arms and her arms are, or her arms and her hands are moving as an extension of her shoulders going up and down. The dancer's right arm doesn't swing all the way around, spanning horizontally. She cuts this movement short perhaps because she forgot what it was that she was doing. The dancer is also looking over to the side of the room, perhaps to clarify the dance step to make sure she knows it, but really her focus should be straightforward on these steps that she's meant to be doing in place.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And he could have foot swapped a little bit lower and saved a little bit of energy. And so now when he goes for it, he is left hand on, left foot on. So you can see his, you know, he's kind of fighting this barn door. So he's turning in, but he's not able to hold it. And actually, when he gets up to it, his whole body kind of barn doors off the wall. And he isn't able to keep this tension or hold himself there.

It's not that it's bad, but it's not particularly helpful in order to start the routine out strongly when she doesn't begin with her freestyle with much energy. The dancer could also be using her hips here to make the step bigger. When she's moving forward with one foot right here, her right foot is forward, then she should be moving her hips in the opposite direction towards her left and just engaging more of her body parts. The dancer completes this turn stationary in place right underneath herself instead of using this turn to travel closer to the left side of the room, which she should do. The dancer continues to take very small steps right here. Her feet are very close together and her left foot could be further away from her right foot if she would have taken a bigger step to begin with forward with her left foot. So the dancer is freestyling here before the routine starts. It is good that she is freestyling in order to hear the music and get the rhythm into her body and get herself both mentally and physically prepared. The dancer could use her hips more in this basic salsa step, horizontally moving side to side with each step that she takes so that the movement isn't so concentrated in her footwork. She starts this routine very contained Almost stationary. Yes. She's moving forwards and backwards because that's what the basic salsa step is however, it's very small and perhaps if she starts the freestyle with more energy and Being more mobile not staying so stationary that would help set her up to make these initial movements You're also larger and less stationary and have more energy However, she is freestyling to a very small extent.

I think the hand could be further out just a bit more to allow a more straight bow that stays on one point of the contact here between the string and the bridge a little better. Really nice ball hold fingers are curved over the whoopsie fingers are curved over the The stick really nicely and that thumb is underneath. It could be a little bit more bent here and touching my hair instead Another really nice ending of phrase and starting of a new one. Every single note in that pattern was very distinguishable. The syncopation between the bow and the left hand was also on point. Really nice dynamic contrast to a Subito softer dynamic here intonation up there at the B flat. I'm hearing dynamic changes, but I'm not convinced by the phrasing that they're following with the particular notes that need emphasis. I'm not hearing a lot of direction. I'd like to hear a bit more direction of what the notes are doing and where the chords are going. Really nice phrasing through this Bach piece, the first scales to that pause note. Not the most convincing transition from the really fast accompanimental to the melody here Tempo overall sped up here. I think it could be more effective and dramatic to keep a much slower tempo and then use a little bit more rubato to grow through that phrase of these balayage section. While the third finger is being played and vibrated upon the first finger tends to pop This is indicative usually of excess tension in the hand. It might be just a nerve reflex to the The vibrato, but I would have that addressed Excellent phrasing in here. This is an accompanimental part to the orchestra of the concerto and this musician plays a really nice Accompanimental part with phrasing that matches the possible phrasing that the orchestra will take here stays very in time as well Slight too much pause in between each pattern. Do-da-de-da-do-da-de-da-dum-de-da-de-da-da-ba-de-da-de-da-de-da-de-da-de. A little too much rubato in either direction. I feel like this could be a little smoother between those, both in tempo and a little less pausing when changing between the chords. Regardless of speed, this section speaks very clearly and they have a good handle of the Boeing. Really excellent sitting position. Knees are at an angle towards the floor. Nice tall spine. Instruments coming out at a 45 degree angle from the student's neck and shoulder. This particular section, ba digga dee, ba digga dum, ba digga dum, ba digga dum, ba digga dum, tends to be really syncopated, and it's hard to drive the phrase forward when there's the offbeat syncopation in there. I lost a little bit of that phrasing in here when they finally got to the low note to get back to a higher section just at the end. Another really great double stop pattern. Very in tune. Really nice intonation here with that extended third finger. These double stops have a really nice balance. It's very easy to hear the top and the bottom notes separately, even though they're being played with the same weight and energy. This section has really good tempo throughout intonation right here. Really nice transition between the two moments here, really long and legato to something a little more quick. It was really good. Really nice connection of bow to string here. You can really hear a good transition from each bow stroke up to down. That's really smooth and clear and almost imperceptible. If you were to close your eyes, you couldn't hear the bow changes. It's really nice. Shifting here is really smooth. The thumb moves along with the hand, which is a good technique. You can see a nice curve in each of the fingers as well. No buckling here. Not the most convincing chords here either. Are the chords supposed to be something that's really fast and speed through? Or are you trying to really emphasize the crunchiness and the dissonance that's happening within these chords in its progression eventually back to C major? I'm not too convinced by how they're playing them in this moment.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Looking at the player going into his left-handed mic and layup attempt, the player does a good job jumping off the correct leg, which is going to be his right leg, allowing his body's momentum to carry him closer towards the left side of the rim. However, we will want the player to bring his ball placement position above his shoulders to create more ball security and separation from opposing defenders in a game-like scenario, and also creating a closer gap of releasing the ball quicker towards our target. Looking at the player release on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player does well. Getting his follow through, snapping his wrist towards the direction of the basket, allowing the ball to travel with the proper amount of spin and rotation it needs to get towards our target area. Looking at the top left corner of the box on the backboard, allowing the ball an accurate angle of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the release of the players right-handed making layup attempt in the right frame, we can notice that the player did well squaring his shoulders towards the back of the rim, allowing the ball a better angle of being directed accurately towards the target. Looking on the left side, we can notice that the ball is heading towards our target area, the top right corner of the box on the backboard, due to this player followed through, snapping towards the direction of the basket, allowing the proper spin and rotation the ball needs to develop the proper angle of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the release of the player's left-handed micing layup attempt, we can notice that the ball is not traveling at all near our target area due to the fact that if we look on the right side of the frame, the player's shoulders are not as squared as we want them to be facing the back of the rim. This will allow the ball a better angle of being directed accurately towards the target. Looking on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player did really well at hitting our target point. The top right corner of the box on the backboard having his follow-through go towards the direction of the target, which is going to be the rim, allowing the ball the proper angle of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the release of the player's right-handed make and layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice that, again, the player does well, scoring his shoulders towards the back of the rim, allowing a better angle for the ball to accurately travel towards our target point. Looking at the player initial start on the right frame, going into his right-handed mic-in layup attempt, an improvement that can help the player become more powerful, balanced, and explosive going towards the rim, is having his body placement position lower in the athletic stance. As a result of our players left-handed micing layup attempt, we can notice on both frames that the ball does not gain enough arc, rotation, and power to travel towards our target area, softly dropping inside the rim. However, will bounce off the rim, resulting in an incomplete layup attempt. Looking at the player on the right frame going into his right-handed Mike and Leib attempt, we can notice that the player does well jumping off his correct foot, which is going to be his left foot, allowing him to carry his body's momentum closer towards the right side of the rim. The player also does a good job locking his eyes on his target before going into his release, allowing a much easier finish. Looking on the right frame as our player is going into his left-handed mic and layup attempt. Again, what can help the player become more explosive on his jump? Creating a higher chance of the ball going towards our target point. Is getting the player lower from his body placement position in the athletic stance, allowing a quicker release going towards the rim. Another improvement that can help the player prevent potential turnovers in a game-like scenario is bringing his ball placement position towards his shoulder area, preferably above his shoulders, allowing more ball security and control going into the finish, as well creating separation from opposing defenders in a game-like scenario, having easy access of stripping the ball from the office player.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So he's moving with very choppy short steps, almost like he's dragging his feet on the ground because they're so small. And that ball is barely being touched out in front of him. It's basically staying at this space the whole time as he moves from here to that position here. So he can never move with speed. This will be a very slow, very controlled speed. And what he is doing a good job of is the ball's not getting too far away from these cones. He's keeping it there. So I think that's fine. He's showing control. But he's never going to be able to move with speed ever as he goes through here. Like he's not going to be able to do that fast ever. So if he wanted to be able to increase the speed to a higher level, he's going to have to push this ball out in front of him more to be able to like move, push the ball and move in that direction with his body, lower his center of gravity, et cetera. One thing that he's doing a lot of is he's only dribbling with the inside of his foot. So he's never properly running with the ball. Like the ball's never out in front of him at any point in time. And he's touching it out in front of him and then getting to here and then controlling it and touching it out in front of him. It's constantly in this space of just slightly below or directly below his body. And then therefore it's forcing him only to use the inside of his feet to dribble back and forth between these using small touches, which he's showing efficiency in doing. It's just a little bit of like the ball's being directly underneath him is awkward. It's gonna force him to be more upright with his body and he can never like move. Like he just, so if he's practicing this skill and they saying, okay, I'm only allowed to dribble with the inside of my feet, then he's doing this correctly, but he's still not moving though in this direction with his body. He's just moving directly over the cones and touching the ball. So is this just gonna be something about defining what he's actually trying to accomplish in the activity from this perspective, if he's gonna dribble only with the inside of his feet, I'd still want him to use a cut catch where he's cutting the ball across his body, moving with it at the same time with his body, catching the ball with that left foot here, take a touch, cut it across his body, catch it, move with the ball at the same time. So he's constantly doing that motion. Again, this is like the issue with the ball being underneath his feet is that if he doesn't take a strong touch and he moves ahead of the ball, like in this case his whole body is now ahead of the ball, it breaks down the whole activity. And that's simply from just him continuing to dribble with the ball underneath his body as opposed to keeping it out in front of his body. That would be the recommendation that I make for him is that even though if he's dribbling with the inside of his foot, that's fine. That's part of the task. It's just a matter of keeping the ball out in front of him so he can push it and move with the ball at the same time. That's going to help him do this much more efficiently. So one thing is he gets around the edges here and he's supposed to go around this direction because he's like staying so upright, he gets around with like little choppy steps here with the inside of the foot. He's not lowering his center of gravity by bending his knees and wrapping his foot around this ball to be able to push it here and then push it here. Like he could do this with less touches if he tries to like get a better surface connection on the ball, like wrap his foot around it, really try to give it direction and hit it out in front of him, really bend those knees and lower those hips and get a body lean in the direction that he wants to go. Like that, those things would really help him in this case, but he's just very rigid when he gets to the end, very upright with his body shape. That's not what we would wanna see in this moment. So, the subject is doing a cone dribbling exercise where he's being asked to dribble through these cones here, turn, and then dribble back around through in that sort of sequence. His body should also be trying to move as much as he can in that same pattern. That's something that we'll take a look at. One thing that we kind of see from him right away is that he's basically splitting his body in half, standing directly over the cone line and keeping like his right side on one side, his left side on one side. So in terms of like actually executing the exercise, that's incorrect. The other thing that's leading to this is that these are very small distances between the cones. It's a tight exercise, a tight space. And so he's going to have to take much smaller touches as he dribbles through these cones, like quicker with his footwork, quicker with his steps. And this is a little bit more complex given his skill level and ability. I would immediately say that he should make more space between the cones or maybe even eliminate some of the cones. I think that would help him tremendously if he were to do this exercise again. This may be one of the better, like just showing the body position that he has as he's moved from there to there. Like for the first time, he's actually trying to bring his foot, his left foot around that cone and bring his whole body around that cone and then move back through the space. And he just brought the ball across his body. He caught it with his right foot. He's maintaining a good distance away from the cone. He's got a better lean with his upper body, you see, over the ball. That's much better in this case. His arms are out to the side a little bit more for balance. So he looks more relaxed in this situation. That plant leg or support leg is a little more bent, so he's lowering the center of gravity. This is a better picture. And he could pick up the ball and then potentially increase speed or move better or more efficiently back in that direction. So I would encourage like each rep, try to look like this as he gets to the outside here, as he gets to the outside here, as he gets to the outside here. That's more dynamic. It's more athletic. He can move much better with the ball. So this is what happens sometimes when that ball gets stuck underneath your body and it's too tight to you if he's standing up and the ball's directly underneath him is that he can take too heavy of a touch and that's what happened when he got to here. He misjudged the strength of the touch to get the ball across to the next side so instead of touching it like where it should go probably right here to catch it he's hit it double that distance and now he's had to overstretch you can see with his body to get there to catch it he's trying to wrap his foot around the ball to prevent it from going off in this direction okay so that's the correct technique to correct this instance but you can see now with his body how twisted up he is so like this foot's this one's way extended this one is further behind his body he's still a little bit too upright with the upper body so he's not able to just efficiently move through here to get to there to fear to get to there again my recommendation will be that he has to simplify his task by what surface of the foot that he's using to go through the cones and clearly define that he has to try to move with the ball at the same time in order to do that because his skill level is not high enough he needs to get more space between each of the cones to give himself a little bit more leeway or a little more grace to make mistakes and those types of corrections to the setup of the exercise will help a player of this skill level be able to have more success So this is what I mean by his body, he's staying sort of really kind of, he's bent over with his head, that's clear, so his head's over the ball, upper body, torso is very straight up, so he's rigid, his knees are only slightly bent, and he's staying, his middle of his body is staying over the cone line, so he's basically going left foot to here, catch it, to here, catch it, but his body moves just straight on this line. The activity is actually supposed to be that he moves with the ball through these cones here, so he's performing that incorrectly at the moment. Because these cones are so tight, again, he's going to have to take small steps, small touches as he goes through this, and he's going to have to really speed up his foot action to do this really efficiently, so that's number one, he would benefit from doing that. Number two, I think because of his skill level, if you simplify the task by saying, hey, just use only your right foot to do this for X amount of time, and then left foot to do it X amount of time, that would really help him just stay really focused on the surface that he's using, moving with the ball, his footwork, et cetera, because you're simplifying the task for him.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Look how the ball comes off the fingertips, snapping of the wrists. He kind of jerks his follow-through back here a little bit. You can see it here.

Good extension here. Guide hands at 90 degree. He leaves the floor. Still has eyes on his target. Great dribble to get yourself somewhere. Big step with the left foot. Right leg is gonna follow. Eyes and head are up. Two hands on the ball as you bring it up to release it. Here's this lift, pushing off really powerful, really extending that leg and hip, pulling the right knee up, eyes are up, the guide hand comes off at the last second, he's got a shooting hand behind the ball, great angle to score it against the glass. He chooses to take one power dribble, and when I say power dribble, it's a dribble that takes you somewhere. In this case, it's taking him to the basket. It's a dribble out in front of you. It gives you momentum and lift. I love that his eyes and head are up. He's not looking at that dribble. He steps with his right on his way to the basket. Here's the release. It's leaving the shooting hand. Guide hand stays up. Great lift. Great verticality. Both his shoulders are facing or square to the basket. Again, great push off the left foot, pulling up the right knee. Look how he lifts it with two hands, you know, but you can see here, here it looks like he's got two hands on the ball, but that guide hand was just like real light, soft pressure. Then it comes off as you're ready to release the ball. And then that guide hand comes off, but that arm bar, left non-shooting arm, stays at 90 degree. Beautiful extension of the shooting hand and arm. The ball leaves the fingertips soft angle here to use the glass. There's the landing. A little off balance here. Let's get our arms up. The ball comes out off the rim in a real like game situation. You want your arms and hands up to rebound it. A shooter moves from left to right to shoot a layup. Love that he uses a dribble to give him momentum to lift. He steps on that left foot, pulls that right knee up. Love how he's got two hands on the ball as he raises it. He's got his shooting hand, his right hand, his left hand, the guide hand on the side, his eyes and head are up. Love how the left hand came off, the ball's leaving the fingertips, guide hand here, you can see it. Great lift, great footwork. Again, picks that ball off the dribble, has two hands on it, eyes and head are up. Big step here, good spacing between the feet. Left, bringing that right leg around. Again, beautiful footwork here. It's perfect. Big step on the left foot, pulling that right knee up and lifting, eyes and head are up. Look how he's got two hands on the ball because he's still taking it up. So he's got great support, you know, stability, control, you know, if there's defense, and this is what I'm to be strong with the basketball so that defense doesn't strip you. Here he follows it with a left foot step. Again, two hands are on the ball as he moves the ball from the floor up into his shooting motion. He uses his left foot to square his body to the basket. Great lift and elevation. Arm bar is 90 degree. Good extension and follow through sending the ball to the top of the square.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The dancer is doing a good job of keeping her eyes on level. She's not looking up or down, she's looking straight ahead as indicated by also her head and her being aligned, but also her chin being perpendicular, or sorry, her chin being parallel to the floor. So that her head being balanced like this and her eyes being straight forward is a great sense of pure focus. And it's also great alignment that her wrist is also in line with the rest of her arm and that her fingertips also Finish and extend that line. So her arm is straight and her hand finishes that line completely The dancer could have executed this final pose in which she is bringing her arms into a shrugging position with better energy. She could have stricken that position just with more vigor, especially since it's the very last movement of the dance routine. It would be great if she should put all her effort and energy into it so that she could end and finish strong. And the dancer is also able to rotate her leg so far in and out to this extent because she has the stability of bending her right leg. So bending her right leg and being grounded in her right foot, that stability is allowing the mobility of her left leg. And the mobility that's happening in her leg turning is coming from her hip. Her hip joint is initiating right here in this frozen moment, this internal rotation or medial rotation towards the center of her body. And she does really turn and execute that very well, has a great range of motion here in the rotation of her hip. The dancer has a good rhythm in these beginners basic salsa dance steps before she actually begins a routine. So what she's doing here is just filler, it's not actually part of the routine, but it's still good. She's going forward one two returning to the center count three, she holds in the center count four, and then goes backwards count five six, returns to the center on seven, holds there in the center and count eight. So those anchoring of steps four and eight in the rhythm is part of salsa rhythm that she's asking very well and so her rhythm here filling all eight counts precisely how I indicated is an execution of a basic salsa step. The dancer has a great rotation here of her entire left leg inward and then outward or inward towards the right side of the room and then outward to the left side of the room. She's really rotating her foot, her toe faces to the right side of the room and then now it's facing to the left side of the room so it's great that she has such mobility here. The dancer has a great range of motion here in her shoulders, shimmying her shoulders, so we see her shoulder blades move front and back rapidly, which is just a great execution of this step, but also it's a great usage of her shoulders that she's also adding in her shoulders with this rapid movement even while she's executing footwork. The dancer is extending her left arm here in a straight line, which is really good that she's straining her arm completely. That's awesome.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The piano player's fingers are pretty straight here. You can kind of see that they're not really bent very much. So it's resulting in not a very nuanced sound. It's kind of a, it's kind of, it has a very harsh attack. And so he could be getting a better sound if his fingers were more curved. The piano player is kind of moving his arm back and forth a little bit when he's playing these notes up here, which is not really a very good technique and I think is some extra motion that's not really necessary, so it's not the most efficient technique. However, he is getting a pretty even sound from his fingers, but his arm is kind of making it harder than it has to be for him.

Very stable rhythm and creates a great effect of groove, as we would call it. This is a good example of a nice curve to the fingers, a nice natural curve. The only problem is we want to be a little bit further up on the keys, so a little bit more curve so that we can get the first finger also further up on these keys and have more notes available to us. These chords being played in the right hand, these last three chords that were played, very well balanced, great articulation. They sound really good. The notes that were just played with the right hand, the last maybe six notes or so, the rhythm wasn't very stable on them. They were shorter than they should have been for this melody. And a lot of that is because of the tension that we see. Like you can see this tension, this tendon popping out, this tendon popping out. And just by this unnatural curve of the fingers, when we have that kind of tension, we're less accurate because it's harder to control our fingers. So actually being looser will allow him to play with more control, meaning a lot better rhythm. It can control the length and the articulation of the notes better. We should be a little bit softer here. We should have done a decrescendo here, because this is a lower point of the phrase, and that's gonna give us room to grow. So a little bit of decrescendo here, just to make it interesting and give the melody a structure. On those repeated B-flats, we're losing, audibly losing a couple of them. And this is because when you're doing fast, repeated notes on one finger, it's difficult to let the key come all the way back up before pressing it down again. So one way to get around this would be having just a bigger movement in general, so the key's coming all the way up, or doing an alternating fingering on the same key, perhaps two and three on that B-flat, so that you have a little bit more control of it. Those last four high voice notes that were played with fingers 3, 4, 5 in the right hand are getting lost because he's anticipating the shift, so he's leaving those notes too soon. So just make sure to play those a little bit louder and a little bit longer so we can really hear that pickup into the chord.

Right here you want to be able to go straight up, be strong, be smart, and power the layup. Or here, standing straight up right after the dribble. Maybe get the center of gravity down a little bit lower. Pound it a little bit. Because right now, that ball is traveling a little bit too far as he's standing straight up when dribbling. Right here, he's in a good position to recover quickly and coming down on two feet is critical. So just being able to be quick on your feet, change directions after making that layup is really a positive outlook on it. Great job coming off the left leg and landing it with the right hand. Or here, the Anaconda Bay Warth, great possibility of making it. He did jump off his left foot, but look at the elevation. The elevation is kind of a result of the effort he's given. If he were able to give a little bit better effort, he would have been able to jump a little bit higher for the layup. Or here, elevate it really high, put himself in a good position to make a layup. Could have started a little bit higher, but right now for the sake of the tutorial, I'm sure he's starting low to get one to two dribbles and a powerup.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I would encourage the dancer to really take the time to practice the musicality because right now they're not on beat. I would encourage the dancer to think about breath. They're currently holding their breath throughout most of this section. And by using the breath and releasing the upper torso and the head, neck and shoulders would help the dancer have more control of the body and be able to be on the beat. Right now, they're kind of tensed up and have restricted movement within the body. Again, I would encourage dancers to be more grounded by bending their knees and sending those hips back so they're more Have more agility to be able to go hop step and a triple step and kind of transition For on this perpendicular plane that like they need to Which would help with the directionality thus their use of space in the dance I would encourage the dancer to release the tension in their arms because they're holding their tension here. So by practicing the steps more, they will be able to feel more confident in their steps that they are doing, and it would improve the overall quality of the music, quality of the movement, but also make sure that they're on the beat.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

It's a little flat, so the turn looks flat. And I think that would add a little more elevation and a little more up and down in her movements to give it a bit more range. But otherwise, really nice, clean turns. She's keeping the same rhythm of steps in her feet as she spins around and accenting with her arms. So here's I think as when she stepped out to the side as she crosses over she can definitely do a bit more movement in her upper body so maybe rotating that body or turning it slightly to the corner and I definitely think also a little bit more flexibility in her chest and neck and head give a little more movement there as well. So here the dancer starts stepping in place. She has a nice bend in her knees. Her foot is slightly lifted up off the floor and she has a really nice rotation in her arms and shoulders. I do think she could shift her weight to the balls of her feet so she's not stepping so flat on the floor and just kind of keep the heel slightly off and that would just help her steps to appear a bit lighter. Here when she steps forward she has a nice twist in her hips. They kind of twist around instead of just going side to side. They have more of a circular rotation that they're doing. So again here when she steps out to the side, this heel on the right should be up whenever she steps out. She does have a nice bend of the knees. I think if she stepped on the ball of her foot of the right leg then this knee could bend a little bit more as well. Otherwise nice job also moving the hip side to side as well as keep her arms rotating.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

If this straightens out a little bit more, the climber has plenty of ape to get between both. I think that would be something worth trying.

So I was able to back down onto that jug, recollect and gain an intention for how to do the finish move, or this finish sequence, I should say. And here they are executing that. And after that sequence, the climber is able to come into this jug off of the second hold in the sequence. So committing to that heel hook, the climber comes in and does a quick match on this hold. Mostly just to open up the hips, to bring the hips from over here to over here, and then back over to get into this right hand here. And after regaining the left hand on the finish hold, the climber is just unable to muster the energy required to get the match in and they just fall off and hopefully get to try again. And after achieving the finish hole with their left hand, the climber just didn't quite know what to do with the feet, so they're now backing down to this jug, which is a good tactic if you get overwhelmed and you do have the option to back down into a jug. So the climber takes that here. Climber then is able to roll out to the finish hold here. They are generally confused as to how to get through this sequence. They looked like they were maybe going to try and hand heel match or hand toe hook match. They decided against that. This is the left hand that they were on, which I know this hold, it's a pretty in-cut, like 20mm edge. And this hold here is an old voodoo sloper, a little half moon action. It's not the best hold in the world, but it's not terrible. And the climber is just figuring out how to get from over here to underneath it over here, which is a pretty tough transition for the climber. Here we have a sit start matched on a jug here. Left hand relatively high, at least for the size of the climber. And looking up at the first hold. After matching this hold, the climber campuses the feet out and are able to get some higher feet here, which were handholds from the previous sequence. Now the climber has a left hold on this crimp rail here, and looking down at what to do with the feet. And after matching this hold with the feet, the climber was able to match this blue hold down here and make a big stand up move to this down pulling jug here. So you can see the climber is pretty stretched out. It doesn't require a ton of core tension. I think all the holds that the climber is on are very good. And this is also just a huge foothold so the climber should be able to maintain a relaxed composure through this. Climber goes up left hand into this jug-like hold and then opts for this inside heel hook. This climber uses an unorthodox technique, just like in general, and this inside heel hook is just a little weird. Ideally the climber would probably either not use a heel hook or get it outside so that the climber can open up their hips a little bit and shoulder in to this left hand hold. But nevertheless, the climber is on two jugs so it doesn't really matter.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

That's going to provide more flavor to the sauce that's being made in the pan from the tomatoes. The cooked scrambled egg is added into the tomato mixture. The egg is being broken up into smaller pieces and heated through so that it's the same temperature as the sauce. Here the garlic, green onions, and chopped tomatoes have been added to the saut\u00e9 pan. The preparer is then taking basically a pancake turner and pressing down on the tomatoes. What he's trying to achieve is he's trying to get the tomatoes to release some of their juices. Now some tomatoes are going to be juicier than others, especially if you have very ripe, larger tomatoes that you cut in quarters or wedges, as opposed to the cherry or grape tomato which is not going to have as much liquid. The preparer has cracked two eggs into a bowl, added some salt, and is using chopsticks to mix the eggs. Chopsticks are an appropriate tool to use for mixing the eggs. Other types of tools you could use would be a fork or a wire whisk. The goal here is that you thoroughly mix the eggs so that you achieve a homogeneous mixture without any streaks of white and yolk separate from the mixture. Here he has three cloves of garlic, which he has taken from a head of garlic. He is using the flat side of the knife to pound a clove of garlic in order to easily remove the skin. The pounding process actually cracks the skin open and makes it much easier to remove. Here the preparer is adding some water to the saute pan that still contains the tomatoes, garlic, and green onion. And this is to help to extract some of the juices out of the tomatoes and also the flavor from the tomatoes and to create a sauce for the eggs. The egg is allowed to sit briefly in the saut\u00e9 pan to begin cooking, and then the preparer takes the chopsticks and scrambles the egg, but only to the point where the egg is still moist and shiny. The egg is then removed from the pan to a bowl. The important thing with cooking scrambled eggs is that they're not overcooked and they are not dried out. So you want to look for that moist and shiny appearance on the outside of the eggs. Here the egg is being added to the pan and you don't hear significant sizzling or any sizzling at all and this is what you want. You want the pan to be warm enough to cook the egg but not too warm in that it browns the egg. Here the preparer has chosen to use either a Japanese or Chinese cleaver for cutting the vegetables. This is an appropriate knife to use, and he is cutting on a wooden cutting board, which is also appropriate. Once the mixture was heated thoroughly, the finished dish is then put into a clean bowl for serving. Here, salt and pepper is being added to the tomato mixture for seasoning. It's important to note that salt will also help counteract any bitterness from the tomato. If the tomatoes are bitter, one could use either salt or sugar to counteract that bitterness. In addition, the salt is added to enhance the flavor of the dish. Here a saute pan has been selected and the heat has been turned on underneath the saute pan to heat the pan up. A neutral flavored oil is being added to the pan. The idea behind a neutral flavored oil is you want the oil to work as creating nonstick in the saute pan, but you don't want the flavor of the oil to be imparted on your dish. So you can use something like a canola oil or a grapeseed oil. Both of those are neutral. Here, cherry tomatoes are being cut in half using the same cleaver as was used earlier. This knife is suitable for this task. However, you can see that the knife is slightly dull. There's resistance trying to cut through some of those tomatoes. So sharpening the knife would improve the ability to easily cut through those tomatoes. The preparer also has a container, which in this case is a bag, to collect food scraps, which is just adjacent to the work area. You can also use a bowl or other type of container, but this is a good practice to have so that your work area stays clean and neat and you collect all your waste scraps in one area.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I like that he picks up the cutting board here and scrapes his vegetables directly into the bowl with his paring knife. Another option would be to hold the bowl underneath countertop height and scrape the vegetables into it that way, or picking up all the vegetables by hand and transferring them to the bowl. But this is a very skilled way to transfer efficiently. Here you can see that in both the instances of finishing the onion and finishing the cracking of the egg, he leaves all of his garbage or waste on the side of his workstation. He would be better served to throw that directly into the garbage can immediately after use so that it doesn't contaminate his egg mixture. I like that he is taking the pan and swirling it to ensure that all of the edges of the pan are coated with the olive oil. This is so that the omelet does not stick to the bottom of the pan once it's added to the pan. He contemplates just pinching it in or eyeballing how much seasoning he needs. And I think it's great that he went ahead and got a measuring spoon so that he knows exactly how much salt he is adding to his mixture. Next he takes his slices and holds them together and comes to crosswise hatches where he is dicing the onion finely. As he cuts the red onion in half, you can notice that he's not 100% comfortable with this knife, even though it's just a small paring knife. He doesn't really know exactly how to most efficiently and effectively cut a red onion. He has his thumb and his finger out holding the red onion, where he should have his knuckles out closest to the blade of the knife. Step two is gathering all of your ingredients. He has chosen a red onion and is getting a egg and a pepper from the fridge. Additionally, he has chosen the correct tool here with which to flip his omelette and the correct timing. So as you can see, almost the entirety of the omelette is cooked by the color visual and he is ready to flip his omelette. Next he cuts his serrano pepper into very thin slices the serrano pepper is obviously a personal preference it will add a great deal of heat to your omelet and Slicing it lengthwise. I'm sorry crosswise in this way is the right method to Use a pepper like this in this recipe He seems confident in making the slices on the red onion half here, although you can see that he still has his finger out holding the red onion as he slices. He should have tucked his finger beneath his knuckles so that he could more efficiently and easily slice the red onion. However, this repetitive motion of swirling the oil again and again, now for the third time indicates to me that he doesn't have a very confident knowledge, or he doesn't have an expert knowledge of how to create this recipe from start to finish. Again, I like here that he folds his omelet in half once it is completely cooked. This is a more traditional way of considering an omelet recipe, is a half fold. He appears to add about one tablespoon of oil. Next he adds a little bit of olive oil to the pan that is heated. This is the correct time to do this step. You could also use butter or cooking spray. He cuts the heat to low and then proceeds to flip the omelet. Here he is rinsing his mixing bowl that he's going to use to make the egg mixture. I always like for the tools and utensils that I use in my recipes to be fully clean prior to starting any recipe, so this is a good step to take. And last, he heats his pan after his egg mixture is already combined. He hasn't whisked it yet, but this is the appropriate time to start the heat on your pan, unless you are an expert at making an omelet. You don't want your pan to get too hot too early, and so he is starting the pan at medium heat at an appropriate time. He flips it one final time to ensure for doneness and then he is ready to serve. That is the last step is to transfer the omelet directly to your serving plate. Cooking an omelette takes about one and a half minutes on the first side and 30 seconds to one minute on the second side depending on how much brownness you want on your omelette. And here he appears to have good color on the first side and is waiting for the second side to get good color. The first step in cooking an omelette is gathering all of your equipment. Here he has selected a frying pan or omelette pan that is non-stick. And using his paring knife he cracks the egg directly over top of the mixing bowl. Another alternative would be to tap it lightly on the edge of the bowl or tap it lightly on the countertop to achieve the same result. He chooses to season his mixture before adding the egg, which is a little out of order. Honestly, he should have waited to season the egg mixture until after the egg was in the bowl. It could go either way. You can see here that the majority of the underside of the omelet is completely cooked. The visual cue here is that most of the egg is cooked, is white or yellow. There's still a little bit of orange here in the center that will cook when he flips the omelet over. After cutting the tip off of the red onion, he should set the paring knife down on the side and peel the red onion without having a knife in his hand. Having the knife in his hand is a dangerous way to peel an onion. Here you can see that he has chosen a spoon to mix his egg mixture. I would recommend using a fork or a whisk so that you can incorporate more air into the omelette. It'll also help in assisting with breaking up the egg white and the egg yolk and to get all of the ingredients combined quicker. When you're ready to serve, you want to cut the heat off of the omelet so it doesn't continue to cook and transfer your omelet successfully in one motion to the serving plate. In order to produce any recipe you need a clean workspace, which he has here. This cutting board looks very clean, has not been used recently and he is taking great care to keep his workspace clean as he works. He adds the egg mixture to the pan in a single layer, and because the pan is already hot and the oil is coating the bottom, his egg mixture begins to cook immediately. He also selects a flat spatula, which will be good in turning the omelet, and a paring knife in order to chop his vegetables.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

As that comes to a simmer, he adds in his sweetener, which is here a white granulated sugar. It looks like he adds about two teaspoons of sugar. That's an appropriate amount given this liquid measure that's in here. You could also use honey, maple syrup, brown sugar, or a sugar substitute like a stevia. Here you can see that his eye is turning red and heating up without any pot or pan on top of it. Obviously you do not want to cut on your heat source prior to there being a vessel or a piece of equipment on top. And once the tea is finished steeping, you can see that he is holding the tea bags down with his fork in the right hand and pouring the tea mixture into his mug with his left hand. Tea typically takes between three and five minutes to steep and that is why he is standing here watching it because milk has a tendency to boil over if the temperature is too high and so he is attempting to control the heat while his tea continues to steep for that sweet spot between three and five minutes. However, this step of pressing the bags up against the side of the saucepan with the spoon is an unnecessary step to take. He could just leave the tea bags in there as the milk heats up. The first step to making a cup of tea is to boil your liquid. He has already cut his stove on to medium high without any pot being here. That's an error obviously. He adds two chai tea bags directly to the milk and that is so that as the milk heats up the tea bags will steep into the mixture and the tea will be extracted into the liquid. He adds a little bit of water to his mug before adding the mixture or the milk and the water combination directly to the saucepan. Here you can see he measures his milk or some type of dairy directly into the mug that he is going to use as his serving mug. This is a good way to measure how much liquid you will need. He could also be doing this in a liquid measuring cup.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

So it really is gonna encourage him to go left hand at first for this move and Pinch with the right hand and generate from that right hand because that that pinch that little crimp right here is so small And we can see that he hits the hole but just isn't able to hold it. It looks like maybe something with accuracy so he may be onto something and then just kind of getting this move down a little better but so right now he's you know he's hitting the hole but he's just not able to latch it and keep the keep the tension there. I think this one is more about accuracy. He had the right idea, moved the right way but just wasn't able to grab the hold in the right spot and I think that's what's going to kind of come down to this problem is you have this hole that's more accurate so you want to move more slow. They probably have set it up to make you move left hand to it and so by trying to break it he might have some success but it could just be making the problem all around a lot harder.

Here we can see how the climber continues to glance over at the hold at reach and has already swung over to the right and pushed forcefully onto the left foot as he's no longer having contact with the hold. This is once the climber has reached the chest height where the grips are, then he pulls himself into the wall. This is so that the center of gravity follows his body when performing the jump. The climbers is starting at a two hand hold start and as we can see he's applying the grip at the bottom area of the hold The type of hold he's sustaining is rounded with a hold on the inside. This type of hold is called a donut and where the climber gets to place the fingers as far in inside of the hold since there is a groove and Presses down on the fingertips as well as on the thumb placed on the outside in order to secure the grip. As we can see the climber is doing a step up start where he places the feet on to the wall and once the climbers placements are secured Then the climber starts The climber had pushed forcefully on the right hand before releasing it and immediately after the release the climber's right foot was engaged to boost the jump. He is now with flying for a quick fraction of a second and it is important that the climber knows exactly when to boost the move. For this case the climber was making himself close to the wall when pulling himself into the wall but once engaging into the right foot the climber due to rotating his right shoulder out to go out for the reach, his center of gravity was slightly thrown out away from the wall when boosting the right foot for the move. The climber is aiming is the term that we use for glancing over to the hold at reach since he will be performing a dyno and where he's right now building momentum by swinging while he had lowered his center of gravity. This is to keep the feet at a high foot placement and when the climber is ready then he will swing over to that direction at reach and we'll have to press forcefully onto the left foot in order to get that direction and push over with force to spring out of the move.

And I was trying to catch it where her hand was kind of bent over, but you can see that and we want to really... Maybe she's too far away. It might be helpful to kind of scoot up toward the piano to have a more... I think it would be helpful to scoot up just a little bit. Maybe she's extending too far and that is not allowing her hands to really have that full grasp of that nice rounded hand position. Okay, so throughout this section She Her memory is like the issue right now is memory loss of the piece and what she is playing and so it would be very helpful to have the music out and to to look through some of those sections you Alright, so she is using the pedal. You can see in her hair her foot is extended using the pedal, but a little more intentional pedaling would help to connect those phrases so that it doesn't feel so choppy and abrasive. All right, and so this left hand going up and down again We have some awkward reaching over the top with the fingers and so slowing that down and really working out those phrases would be very helpful All right, and so we want to be really careful Especially here in those fingers where she's reaching all the way up on top of the keyboard we want to make sure that our fingers are always staying on the piano and That it would it would be helpful to play You know if she could tuck those fingers back in bringing into that rounded C position It would help her even though she's spreading out It would help her to hit those keys more accurately and not feeling like she is Attaching on top of the keyboard Alright, so a bit of a memory slip there again. I think slowing it down Maybe some work with a metronome would be helpful It also I think at this point would be helpful to just have the music that I don't think it's necessary To play it memorized and that would ensure correct pitches All right, so through that we can kind of see that pinky winging up there and we really so my recommendations would be to um, number one trim nails because we can't get a good hand position when We're clicking on the keyboard. Um I would adjust the body position and posture while aligning to the piano and I would really focus on That nice rounded hand position and then in addition I would be working on the Hands alone slowing things down and bringing those pieces out of the memory  Alright, so this is really kind of more what we're looking for. We want to still and in order to fix some of these things we really need to go back to basics and so we're gonna have to really slow that down and kind of work through those. We're gonna have to work in sections to clean that up because just running it over and over quickly and quickly and faster and faster is not going to clean up some of those sections. So if we can't play it with good technique at a slower tempo we're not going to be able to play it well at a faster tempo. All right, so I caught it here. You can see that overarching reach that is just awkward in that playing. And so even though this is something that she has learned and memorized, it would be really helpful to kind of break that apart in sections again, work hands alone, work through those phrases to really clean that up and really iron out some of those fingerings and hand techniques and all of the technique of just playing and feeling more in control of your playing. All right, so we have some overextension up here and Although it is a keyboard you can hear her fingernails clicking which is Difficult to listen to Her Her hands have a lot of tension in them and so just like taking that second to kind of relax and And think through what you're gonna play would be really helpful Alright, so through this section Again, you can kind of sense the frustration in and the frustration It comes from memory loss of not being able to remember the piece, but then that in turn affects You know the abrasiveness and that the harshness that she is playing the piano She gets a lot of tension in her fingers here. You can see her tendons kind of popping up in her hand and It so much of that could be alleviated by having that sheet music and being able to look at that But it be by not remembering what she's playing it creates a whole gamut of bad habits that are Perhaps not regular for her as an instrumentalist So throughout the section with that repeated pattern over and over again, that's just telling me that she doesn't remember it And so having the music would be very helpful You can see here that awkward right hand second finger position It's strained She's still reaching a bit here. And so Curling those fingers up it appears that her nails are a bit long and that is perhaps why she doesn't have that nice curved round position Okay, so again, hand position, getting music out, readjusting your body position, all those things will help in your playing. Alright throughout this section the pianist has decent body posture her Hands have a bit of tension throughout them It Appears that she may be uncomfortable playing on a keyboard versus a real piano However her like as she's releasing her hand here We want to feel that release from the wrist and we don't want to have the whole hand Be lifting it gives us it doesn't give us a solid sense of phrasing throughout our left hand we're really Pounding down through those and so our fingers are long and extended and we want to make sure that we have that good rounded hand position and that helps us to stay really even and steady in our in our quick notes She has some nice phrasing that she's going through, but again, that like we have to look at the basics in the That basic technique in or lack thereof as we're looking at things because when we have those flat fingers it it disrupts a lot of the playing and You know like the it's this is a lovely piece But to take it to that next level we really need to execute those basics more consistently Alright, this has a much slower tempo, but you can see her hands here. We still have that Really long fingers. You can see here Her fingernails are very long and so we when we're playing the piano We want really short fingernails because we want to play more of a hammer action and that allows us to have that even setting tempo I do think at this point she's a little too far away from the piano So by scooting forward a bit, it's gonna give her She's gonna feel more in control All right, so just overall rough and harsh and it's actually evident that she enjoys playing this piece and because it's frustrating to her that she's not executing it well but we have some basic deficiencies in technique that are prohibiting her from being successful even I imagine with sheet music in front of her. Again, it's very hasty. It is evident that she's had this memorized before, but at this stage, with memory and recall and sloppy phrasing, it would make more sense to slow it down and bring that sheet music back out. Okay, so as she, again, it's futile to kind of play through some of these things that there's no music for. So it's clear that she has had some training and she has memorized some of those pieces, but at this point it is, it's difficult to listen to because there's no fluidity, there's no consistency of the piece that she's attempting to execute. All right, so we kind of have some awkward left hand arpeggios there as they're reaching up and down and so I would take a little bit of time to isolate that and really clean that up The right hand is very abrasive as it's playing that main theme and so just kind of lightening up again We want to lift from the wrist so that we can throughout those phrases that we just have a more kind of delicate Even though it is a bit more It is stronger throughout that section we we want to have that delicate interpretation Okay, so again, as there becomes more memory issues, there becomes more severe technique deficiencies. And so, fundamentally, we need music in order to play through these examples. It also, when keeping in that rounded hand position, it also helps to ensure that we have all the correct notes. Maybe slowing down just slightly would help to clean up some of those passages.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He's choosing to shoot like a little hook shot. He's a nice size post player, which that's a good shot for somebody like him. In some cases, you might want to square both shoulders and shoot the ball, but in his case, he's a big man shooting that little baby hook. He's choosing to go off two feet, nothing wrong with that.

He also jumps kind of backwards on his jump shot. He starts here and jumps back a little bit. You never want that, it's going to kill your momentum. You should either be jumping straight up or forward. At least a little forward, honestly. He doesn't really finish his release, he's still bent, he should be up and wrist flicked.

This is the most this is a more difficult version of the of the Mike and drill as this version of the Mike and drill is solely focused on working on the placement of the ball on the backboard and mastering the side spin mastering the usage of the side spin off of the backboard so this is again this is something that we want to make sure that we build up to and this is not a version of the Mike and drill that you show to or have a beginner work on. They have to build themselves up to this version of the Mike and drill by using the basic forms of the Mike and drill where you're jumping off one foot and extending the ball out high with one hand and then also working on the two foot version of the Mike and drill making sure you're using the proper footwork and once they understand the mastery of using the proper footwork in the Mike and drill now you can move on to different variations of the Mike and drill where you can do reverse Mike and drills off one foot, reverse Mike and drills off two foot this version right here of the Mike and drill where you're taking no steps and you're just working on and you're standing underneath the basket and you're just working solely on side spin and placement of the ball on the backboard with his left hand he hits the bottom of the left side of the rim which is something that is not uncommon for beginners to do with the first few times that they attempt this drill as it is with his weaker hand with his left hand so it's his weaker hand so it's more difficult to place the ball correctly and use the proper amount of side spin with our off hand so this attempt hits the bottom of the rim as it was more difficult because it's with his weaker hand The Mike and drill that this player is demonstrating is a higher level version of the Mike and drill where we don't take any steps and we stand directly underneath the basket. From this position, all the layups are going to be underhand scoop slash hook type shots where we work on side spin, creating good side spin on the ball so that since we're underneath the rim, it's really difficult from this position to hit the top right corner of the square. In this version of the Mike and drill, we're aiming to hit outside of the square with good side spin. Place the ball here for it to spin into the basket this way and then on this side, we're looking to hit outside of the square with good side spin with our left hand for it to spin into the basket. This version of the Mike and drill is something that players should work on as they master the basic Mike and drills like the one leg Mike and drill where you step across, jump off your left foot for the right hand finish, jump off your right foot for the left hand finish and then the two foot Mike and drills. Once they've mastered the easier versions of the Mike and drill, then that's when you come to the harder version of the Mike and drill where it's just working strictly on side spin and ball placement on the backboard so you get a feel on the proper amount of side spin that is needed according to wherever you place the ball on the backboard. On this attempt, you can see he places the ball high off the backboard, but it's in the middle section of the square. As he puts a slight amount of side spin on the ball, it's spent off of the backboard and it hit the right side of the rim and we missed the layup. On this attempt, he places the ball outside of the square and he places it nicely, nice and high on the backboard and he puts the correct amount of side spin on the ball and it's bent off the backboard and went directly into the basket.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She kind of skips this undercling for this different beta. But I think the problem is she's trying to pull too hard on this foot because she's not going to be able to do this move statically. This hand is like directly over the foot. So what she's got to do is kind of shift her weight over this foot and then go up or apply that pressure downwards. So what she needs to do is use the right leg and smear it into the wall and have that push her to the left so that she can stand up to the hold. So you can see the moment that her foot kind of pops off. So she's still quite low. And it looks like most of this is being generated with the right arm. So her weight's still so far to the right.

Instead of going for the high foot, they're just very focused on the lower position so they can still do the move, but it's an overly extended position and it's less efficient. So again, we see the climber kind of struggling to find the right foot position. One of the challenges we see with this is actually that they're such a tall climber, there's a tendency to keep the feet really low because they're able to keep the feet in a lower position while they keep reaching. However, for this climber, it seems that it creates kind of this tendency to have to reposition and fish for other footholds and just take more time on the wall. So even though they're able to continue climbing, it's just not very efficient. Climber is able to establish on the problem and they do the first several moves with pretty good pacing. It's a little difficult because the judge is pointing out the holds with the laser pointer as they move and that takes away some of the sequencing aspect from the climber. One of the things that we kind of intend to test in this kind of problem is their ability to memorize the sequence. So it's tough to gauge their ability on that climb for that skill when that's getting pointed out to them. Good coordination on this movement here with shake out and the kind of discus toss where the climber throws the arm as they reach up and pivot the hip to get into the next position. So there's good timing on that move. So there's a lot of foot swapping here where the climber is unable to figure out which position they want to be able to stay in to make this next move. They're coming into the right position here at the end with the right foot and right hip in, but this is looks like the climber basically needs to sequence and plan out more before beginning because they're looking just kind of lost repositioning their feet on the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This tells you that the pan is too hot and the heat needs to be lowered down. A pan that is too hot is going to cause browning on the bottom of the egg, which is not desired for a classic omelet. Here the individual is cracking one egg into the chopped raw vegetables. Instead of cracking the egg directly into the raw vegetables, what should be done here is the vegetables should be sauteed in oil or clarified butter by themselves. Once they are finished sauteing, they should be removed from the pan and set aside. At that point, generally it is two to three eggs that are used to make an omelet. And at that point, then the omelet can start to be prepared on the stove top. Here the omelet is being served flat onto the plate. So an omelet should either be served folded in half, and inside would be any sauteed fillings or cheese that the person preparing would desire. If it is folded in thirds, which is the proper way for a French omelet, then once it's placed on the plate, a slit is made in the top of the omelet, and that is where the sauteed vegetables or filling is placed. Here, the omelet has been flipped over and once flipped, you can hear sizzling again in the pan. So with a classic omelet, you do not flip the omelet. You just allow it to cook as it is inside the pan. And secondly, the temperature is still too hot on this pan, which is causing obvious browning on the outside of the egg, on the side that was just flipped over. And yeah. Here the individual has chosen what appears to be a crepe pan or something similar to that. It is quite wide, but it is not deep. It has very shallow sides, maybe no more than half an inch high. The pan appears to be too large to properly make an omelette in. Instead, something on the order of 6 to 8 inches in diameter, with maybe a 1 inch side on it, also referred to as an omelette pan, should be chosen. Here, the individual is allowing the egg mixer to spread out into a very thin layer. In making a classic omelet, one would gently stir the curds or the egg until it forms soft curds. At that point, the stirring stops, and you continue to cook the egg on very low heat until it is set. Here, oil is being added to the pan on the fire or flame. Traditionally, an omelet is prepared using clarified butter so that it does not prevent or that does not cause browning of the underside of the omelet. The vegetables for the omelette are being chopped using a serrated knife. A better choice here would be a chef's knife.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Right now she's stepping out on her right side and swinging those arms up. And she kind of does a little like swivel snake small release in that movement. And her head is also moving, her shoulders are moving, her arms are moving. Just a really nice play. So I would suggest maybe exaggerating just a little bit more just to give a little more to this movement, but overall really nice. So, for this part when she slaps her knee, she hits the beat perfectly right on the beat and then does a really nice windmill with her arms. It's just really like seamless and just flawless as far as the movement without any breaks or stops. So from the beginning, I just noticed something different with this dancer. She was just very in tune with the music. It felt like a performance. Like I felt like this could be performance ready. Just in her demeanor, even her facial expressions, fully using her arms and extending throughout her fingertips with the really nice feet movement and just accenting all of the musical notes that you hear. Overall, this is a really, really good example for an intermediate. She was able to really show her personality, which I liked because it definitely draws in the audience. She was really comfortable with the steps, with the movements, able to use her arms fully, able to spot and hit all of her marks. A really, really nice job with this one. So here in her spin, she does a really good job at spotting. She's snapping her neck around. You can see it whipping around. If you snap, you'll like kind of feel it whip. So really nice job, a really nice smooth turns on her feet. She's not quite up on her toes right now, but she is able to spin around really nicely and smoothly. So I believe this is supposed to be more of a scoop down to the floor and around, but she did a really nice job staying with the music and really doing what was I guess able for her body at this point. So it's a nice modification to instead of swinging the arm all the way down to the floor, swinging it around front, making the movement a bit smaller but still having the same effect.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The climber is glancing down at the feet again to perform a foot switch where she brought the left toe to come into contact slightly with the foot hold before releasing the right foot from its place. There wasn't sufficient space for both of the feet to be on the hold so the climber had swiveled the right foot out to make slightly some space in the moment that she dropped the right foot. Then she swiveled hard and applied pressure onto the left toe coming into place. Now the right foot being extended and she drops it is to bring her center of gravity again between the grips. The climber was able to recover the move by making the left foot placement and in order to make the reach the climber has to turn the left side of the body towards the wall by turning the toe inwards to be pressed towards the inner edge of the toe as The climber pull onto the right hand to twist the body to bring the left shoulder up To bring the left hand up for the next hold that reach It's important the climber always glances down at the feet to secure the foot placement and this one she applies the right toe to come into place at a high foot placement. As soon as the climber applies pressure onto the foot then she will be able to release the left foot that is out in distance and in doing so she will be able to transfer the weight to the highest foot being in place. The climber quickly had repositioned her right foot by again Jumping the foot further in to place the ball of the foot towards the edge of the hold and as soon as she secured that Foot placement. She's now lowering her center of gravity And extending the left leg The leg extended is called flagging out So the climber is able to transfer the weight to the right foot being in place And at this moment the climber is leaning back on the grips so that she's able to once lowering her center of gravity Make herself move over to the left side so that she is able to Be ready to commit to the move out reach as it would be dynamic the left leg extended the climber will then use it to balance over her main areas of support and And once she will be performing the reach she will then tap the left foot towards the wall to Boost her move to that direction that reach As we can see the climber was able to make the next hold at reach and had kept the right leg extended this is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place and It helps the climber with keep balance over the move The climber is glancing down. This is so once the climber had made the right hand placement, she can readjust the grip by feel to make sure that she is able to secure the grip. Now as the climber glances down, she would be able to look over to the next move that she will have to place for her right foot coming into place. It is important how the climber gets to position her body on the wall. In this case, once the climber had brought the right foot into place, we can see how the right knee is pointing inwards and that helps the climber to keep her right side of the body towards the wall when performing the reach. The climber had brought the left foot to come into a high foot placement but glancing over to the next holder at reach the climber performs a foot switch to instead bring her right foot to come into place and the type of foot switch that she performed was a jump off jump on. The climber is right now demonstrating controlling the stability over the move while performing the match. In doing so, the climber then has completed the climb. The climber in performing the foot switch, her foot had slipped out of the hold so the climber at this moment is sustaining tightly onto the grips on a match. And the way to control the swing, the climber must continue to apply tension on the upper body by performing a pull up, engaging onto the core in order to pick up the feet to bring it back onto the placement. As the climber needed to continue to apply pressure onto that left hand grip, she continues to lay back and had made a high foot placement of the right toe over a large hold. Immediately the climber, after applying pressure, was able to release the left foot from its place. The climber was able to recover the move by pushing onto that left toe towards the hole to pull herself in. And once she gained stability, she quickly is performing a foot switch. As we can see, the climber quickly after bringing herself in, uses that momentum of the pull-in and do a foot switch to drop the weight onto the right toe coming into place. Once the climber was able to gain a civility over the move by applying pressure and adjusting the foot placement, she then pulls herself in by pushing on the toe to bring her center of gravity back onto the wall. Keeping the right leg extended is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place and it also helps when the climber gets to perform the next move. Now the climber has released the left hand from its place and she is shaking it. This will help to release any tension that may have been built up on the grip and having the right arm extended. This is called a rest position so the climber is not engaging on the arm muscle on the pull up and this helps the climber to have recovery during this time. The climber right now is starting at a one hold start where she's placing both of the hands onto the same hold. This is called matching and as we can see this is a positive hold because the climber is able to wrap the fingers around the edge of the hold which this type of hold would be called a jug. As we can see the climber is in her first position before starting the climb so because it's no longer on the mat and has the feet placed at a high foot stance where she right now is dropping the weight and extending the arms to perform the next move at reach. \ub05d A climber easily dropping the weight between the grips and dropping the right foot helped with gaining stability when making the transition of the left hand over to the next hold at reach. Because this was a dynamic move, the climber's right foot has dropped back, bringing the center of gravity away from the wall. So it's important that the climber continues to press onto that left toe placement to recover the move. The climber after resting quickly pushes down on the foot and pulls on the hand to make a rotation of the shoulders towards the wall to send the hand over to the next hold at reach. The climber is able to land the grip because she can cup the top area of the hold, being a jug, to land the weight immediately after being placed. The climber continues to glance down at the feet. This is because she's performing a foot switch and the type of technique that she uses is by bringing the left toe over the right toe right before she pulls out the right foot from its place. As soon as she does that, she will then immediately place pressure with landing the left toe over the hold. This is a technique that could easily go wrong and has to be done timely. So if the climber does not land the foot in place immediately, she could miss the hold as well as she could accidentally pull the left foot out of place when she removes the right foot. The climber has walked over the left hand over to the right side of the hold. This is because the climber eventually will be releasing the right hand from its place as the climber is glancing over to the right side. We can see that dropping the foot helps the climber to transfer the weight to the left foot being in place. So when the climber makes the move the climber can then gain the stability and balance over the move with the right leg extended.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And after getting the foot into that blocked start hold jug, the climber was able to cross over left into this hold here and then get their left foot in on that first hold in the sequence looking out right for the next hold. Here we have the Climber 1 move in on this boulder. They started matched on this hold here and this left foot that they're on now. It then busts up to a pretty similar hold with the left hand. This is an interesting blocking situation. It would be great if this yellow hold wasn't here so that you could just dunk a heel in on the above or below the hand. Because this yellow hold is here, it blocks the ability to get into it with your foot from this position. Pretty interesting. I don't dislike it, but it is a factor in this move. The climber is then able to go out right into this hold, which is a large surface area jug. So you have to have a really big hand to get into it, and most people end up just being able to grab basically the very edge of it, so it acts kind of like a sloper. And again, trying to figure out where the feet are, the climber gets their left foot in on this pink jug, and then is able to proceed up the wall. And after the climber chills on this hold for a while trying to figure out what foot is on Definitely getting pumped the climber is able to pounce up into this jug and it's a good thing. It is a jug because I think the The climber just didn't know what foot was on and this is a very natural phenomenon on a wall with this many holds on it And when you're not competing you just drop off and take a look But when you're competing you have to try and send every attempt And so yeah, you could say that the climber didn't Study what was on on the boulder. You could say that The laser pointer person wasn't doing an accurate job. Either way. The climber is probably more tired than they would be", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

They're not quite ready to play at this tempo Maybe about five metronome clicks slower and they could get the right notes We can see here on the third finger of the left hand that that last knuckle is completely collapsed. We want to make sure that we're playing on the fingertip and not too much on the pad of the finger to prevent that knuckle from collapsing. Pianist is doing something here that we never want to see happen and that's actually resting their thumb, their first finger, on their left hand on the edge of the piano. We always want to have our fingers over the keys, even if they're not being used. This is causing this whole hand to collapse, as we can see here, causing these fingers to be completely on the pad. That's going to make it really difficult to have any control in a meaningful way over your fingers. You would just heard when the pianist was playing those thirds, they were very heavy handed, they were very loud with a slightly harsh articulation because this kind of hand positioning does not allow for sensitivity. Notice that the left hand here is much too flat. We can see that where the fingers meet the hand, right at that bottom knuckle, is actually touching the keys here. So although this is a straight wrist, and that's good, we want to raise the arm up a little bit so that the fingers are less outstretched and can hang down more from the hand. Despite being at too slow of a tempo and lacking pulse, the coordination in terms of playing at the same time between the right and left hand is good. The pianist is doing something good here when we're learning a piece of music. They now have dropped out the left hand and are just working on learning the notes on the right hand. So it's the right move to do because it's too difficult to read with hands together. Taking one hand at a time helps to get the notes at least worked out in one hand and then you can add in the others. So that's a good move. We notice that this is being played with an absence of a pulse. This is because the pianist is sight reading here, but ideally we would want to still try and pick a pulse that we can play this with while learning, but there is no pulse here.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

But also allowing this shooting hand to be pointing towards the rim. Whereas right now, I wouldn't be surprised if this shot went far left. Right here, covering up your vision is definitely not recommended. As I mentioned before, either shift it a little bit to the right so you can see or bring it up over the top to be able to meet your guide hand. Start right here but land it back here. Everything was well. Make sure you stay in the shot. I'm in the flow of the shot. Follow through is there. And the balance will be there too but it's going to take away from your shot when you land and fall backwards or flow backwards. So after your jump shot, like say you want to fall forward and try to fall in the same place where you first started jumping. Right here it looks pretty good. The offhand is not supporting it. The follow through is hand in the cookie jar. It looks pretty good. Catching the ball, then taking one or two steps is a violation. So, you understand the principles, ball in the air, feet in the air.

And then when she has the left hand, she should be able to spring up and extend out that left foot to pinpoint this left hand pinch. And then she'll be able to bring her feet up to the start jug. So then Emilio when she kind of goes into this position, it's so bad she's still trying to be underneath it. So she's not getting any height.

Again, it's outside of the square. So since it's placed outside of the square, the ball needs a good amount of side spin. Also a spin off of the backboard and going to the basket. On this attempt, he didn't put enough side spin on the ball. So it spin off of the backboard and ended up hitting the right side of the rim where we missed the shot short. If he would have put the same amount of side spin on the ball instead of hitting the ball here at this level, but up higher on the backboard in that same spot. So you see it made contact here. But if it made contact on the backboard, just imagine the ball is see-through and it was somewhere up here on the backboard. Then the amount of side spin in which he used, it would have been sufficient because as it spin off the backboard, it was higher off of the backboard. So it had more time to fall down over the front of the rim and into the basket. Since he placed it a little bit lower on the backboard, even though it does have good height, the position in which it hit the backboard, he needed even more side spin. So it would hit the backboard and then go quickly over the front of the rim before gravity has the opportunity of pushing the ball down before it crosses the front of the rim. Here you can see the ball is leaving his hands, his fingertips. From this angle you can see that his arm is stretched out away from his body. So he has the ball as far as his arm will allow him to extend the ball away from his body and then release the ball at the top of his jump. So this is a good release point. However we would like for him to jump higher and give better effort on the jump because as you see his right knee was low as he took off from the ground so he didn't give maximum effort on the jump. So when he released it, although his arm is outstretched, this point where he's releasing the ball is lower than it would be if he gave maximum effort on the jump. He would have gotten a little bit higher and then he would have released it here. Releasing our shot from this point up higher here gives us a greater chance of getting the shot off without it being blocked by the defense. Also too you can see his left arm is down low. Ideally we would like this arm to be up high to protect the ball from the defense who is on his left shoulder and attempting to block or contest the shot. By him having his left arm here and the defense tries to come across, they will end up hitting his arm which will be, the referee will either call a foul or if the referee doesn't call a foul the offensive player's left arm will be able to slow the defender down long enough to allow him to release the ball from his fingertips before the defense has a chance to block or contest the shot. The player here shows the proper footwork when we're jumping off one foot for a right hand reverse layup. He displays the correct footwork by making sure that he jumps off of his left foot. When we jump off his left foot we want to make sure that the right knee is up high near our waist level. From this angle you can't see the location of his knee but you can see from the back view you can see how close his feet are and his right foot is just slightly in front of his left foot which lets you know that his knee is really down low and we need to have that knee up higher as we explode and jump off the floor to ensure that we're creating the proper lift and thrust as we're leaving the ground to reach the highest point of our jump and then we can release the ball from our fingertips here up into the basket, off of the backboard and into the basket from the highest possible point. On this shot attempt here, you can see the ball is placed outside of the square. And from this angle here, you can see it hits the top. It's at the level of the top portion of the square. So since it has good height, but since it's outside of the square, you have to make sure the ball has good side spin. And again, he put good side spin on the ball, it spinned off the backboard and went into the basket. Looking at the placement of the ball on the backboard, you can see it's on the level of the top portion of the square. So he got great height for the ball to hit the backboard. You also can see that it's outside of the square to the right of the square. So from this position, you have to make sure that he put the correct amount of side spin on the ball so it would spin off of the backboard and drop into the basket and the shooter was able to accomplish that on this layup attempt.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And here the cook is grabbing a carton of tomatoes that he'll use in the salad. So the cook is adding each tomato to the bowl after he cuts it. Nothing wrong with that, but it would be a little more efficient if he cut all of the tomatoes first and then transferred them all to the bowl. And the cook has gathered everything up on his knife again and he's transferring it all to the bowl. The cook has set his knife down and now he's going to peel the other half of the cucumber. It would have been easier to leave the cucumber whole and peel it first just so he didn't have to do the same job twice. I'm guessing he cut it in half first just because it's a little easier to slice from smaller pieces but I would have peeled the whole thing first and then cut it in half. Now the cook is peeling the cucumber half. Looks like this is probably like an American or slicing cucumber which has a tougher more bitter and difficult to digest skin. It also tends to be less crunchy so like it can just not be very nice to chew. It looks like he's added the ends to a compost bag in the windowsill which I love. This looks like a decent amount of salt to me. I would maybe even do a little more, but certainly not too much. Also worth noting, the cook is using what we call a wide peeler. It works just fine for this. I think a straight peeler that has the blade in the same direction as the handle is a little bit better for peeling objects like cucumbers. And now he's gathered all the cucumber up on his knife and he's transferring it to the bowl that he has on his cutting board. It looks like the cook discarded one tomato. Maybe it was rotten. Hard to tell from the video though. And he's pulled out some kind of sauce. I can't tell what it is from the video though So here the cook is continuing to cut each tomato in half. It looks like he has a very sharp knife, which is great. It's often best to use serrated knives for tomatoes just because the blade can slip on the skin really easily. But if you have a very very sharp knife, it won't be a problem, and it looks like he's not having a problem here. There you see the cook didn't quite cut through the hallway so as he was transferring that first tomato to the bowl he had to pull the two pieces apart. And on here he's grabbed a pepper grinder I'm pretty sure and is cracking fresh pepper into the tomatoes and cucumbers too which is great. And now he is slicing the two cucumber halves on a bias. He's opening the carton and dumping the tomatoes out onto the cutting board. And he's pouring this over the tomatoes and cucumbers. It's some kind of prepared dressing or sauce, maybe a salad dressing. I can't tell from the video. Now the cook is going to his refrigerator. Here the cook has picked up the cucumber he's going to use. The cook is doing a great job slicing. He looks like he's gripping his knife really well. He has his fingers on the blade so he has good control. His left hand, he could curl his fingers back a little more but it looks really good and I'd say better form than your average home cook. And he's arranged the two halves side by side just like he did with the first half of the cucumber and he's slicing them thinly out of bias. And here the cook has grabbed a container of salt which he's grinding over the tomatoes and cucumbers. And now the cook is cutting the peeled cucumber half in half lengthwise. And the cook is cutting each tomato in half one at a time. And here the cook is using chopsticks to mix it up. This is great, better to start mixing as soon as you add salt to something so that the salt is evenly dispersed and you don't end up with salty parts and under seasoned parts. But he got in there fairly quickly. The cook just cut the cucumber in half. The second to last tomato he cut, you could tell by the way he was sawing in it that the tomato was probably a little on the soft side so it was giving to the knife instead of being sliced by it. And he's cutting off that ends with his knife. The cook did a good job mixing that thoroughly.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I think if she just kind of took a moment to breathe, everything would have flowed together a lot more smoothly. It just felt a little all over the place. So definitely like take deep breaths and that helps a lot to just kind of calm the nerves. So that way everything flows much nicer. So here in the turn, she gets off balance here. She was turning in this section and she should have stayed right there because it was just a spin around but she ended up falling out of it to here. So here's where I felt like the movement started to get a little, lose a bit of the control that she had more in the beginning. Definitely think the legs can be opened out just to provide a little more stability. I felt like her upper body, the arms really didn't have a place. So I really want to keep them in a nice place to keep the movements all clean. Here she steps around to the side. She's like a hair off the beat so she just needs to speed up a little bit. Throughout this sequence I noticed she keeps her knees bent the entire time so that definitely helps her to spin around in all these different directions and just kind of keep herself secured and grounded to the floor. It's up to here. The answer does all the steps correctly and travels across the space. Has a nice energy. So great job so far. So here this is nice, she's stepping out side to side, keeping the knees nice and soft and bent, and then reaching her arm up and around and really finding the groove throughout her body. So here, the movement is really fast but she kind of cuts the movement short a little bit. Definitely with the arms, you want to really extend them out so they can go all the way out and around. And here I can tell she is, like her balance is off and it's like the movements just aren't really flowing as smoothly as they could and should. Subta here, nice job again keeping the balance and spinning around in opposite directions. So good job keeping the energy up here as well.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

So here for the last count at the end, she's hitting every single accent really well. It's a much harder part because it's so fast, but if you really listen to the music and slow it down, she's hitting each beat exactly where it needs to be. So really great job in the details there. And then with the really strong finish with the arms extended out, standing nice and tall, left leg extended out and eyes are stretched forward. So just a beautiful line for the ending as well. Great job overall. So here, I wish you would have extended that arm up again, just to kind of finish the movement. It just felt a bit unfinished. But nice job holding the body up with the left hand and keeping the feet planted on the floor. So up to here, the music has changed to a bit of a faster pace and you hear more drums and beats happening and she's able to keep up and still keep the full movement that she does when she bent down to release. She did so really well. She dropped all the way down to the floor and came back up. So nice job up to there. So here's one part where she really does a great job staying with the music, taking her time with all of the arm movements and hitting this part here with their arms. Her hands open nice and wide and then her legs are opened out a bit with space with her knees bent and feet flat on the floor. So nice job just with the musicality there. Here in the layout, really nice job here. The standing leg is nice and strong. The lifted leg is extended out and straight with the foot pointed. The arms are extended to the side and her eyes are facing the ceiling. So overall, really nice shape in her body for this part. So here she steps out with her right foot two times and she punches forward and to the side. I definitely think the punches could have been a bit more intense just because the music has shifted again to more of a reggaeton style so you hear more of the drums and the bass so her punches should also match that elevated music. And I like that she's taking her time. There's no need to rush through anything. She is, when there's a moment to hold a count, she's holding the count and not trying to rush into the next step. So nice job just listening to the music and being aware of that. So here, nice job up to here again, again, sticking with the music, keeping the rhythm and the pace and her technique looks great. And here she pauses for a second, her body is straight, toes are planted on the floor with the heels up, arms are stretched and extended out really well. So again, really nice lines in her body. So beginning of the dangerous steps out, reaches her left arm out, extends it nicely. As she takes a step, she also swings her right arm around and back, and she does so in a sense that really fills up the music. It's really elegant and just a beautiful opening. So here the music gets a little bit faster and she does much faster footwork. She's on the balls of her feet which is great because that will allow her to move her feet a lot faster as well as keeping the knees nice and soft and bent. So here, as she drops down to the floor, I definitely think she could have used a bit of that energy from right before to slide out a bit more instead of just putting her knee down if possible. But that definitely would have allowed her to use a bit more of the space and just kind of really push her body to match the energy of the music. So in this whole sequence when she was stepping forward and back here and then to the turn out she was on the balls of her feet the whole time with the salsa steps and turned out really nicely with her arms extended so again nice job for that eight count. So here, I can tell she, as she was stepping out with her right foot to rotate her body, a slight bit of balance was lost, but she was able to hold it up in the steps right before. She's walking on her toes really well, on the balls of her feet, and keeping the movements nice and light. So here in the turn, I love that she bends her knees to turn and spin around while her feet are flat on the floor. Bending the knees definitely helps to stay grounded. And as she turns, she's able to control her body really well, spin around smoothly, and then land facing this way.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

That stance could have been a bit wider when they dance, it brings up that leg, the arms in the air and swiveling in the waist there. That was a nice wrap up of the dance. So the choreography is there for the most part, but the movement would flow a bit better if there was that stronger execution and more power behind the movement. Dancer should be extending their arm in the exocentric view. You do see the arm going out directly. You do see the focus out from the dancer directly in front, right? But if we see it from this side, the dancer's arm is not extended straight, fully executed. And that's what should be happening. Nice beginning. The dancer has a fair amount of energy. Pushing that out in the direction to move the body the other way in that first step is what we're looking for so the dancer can engage that movement. The next step where the dancer is bringing the arm around could be a lot cleaner and clearer with that arm pressed out. Again, the dancer is pressing out a bit when they stick that arm out. So you want to see this a little bit more, that curve, rather than this curve when the dancer is pushing that arm out and say, you know, this is the pelvis, right? You want to see this curve. There's a bit of a bend in the elbow here. We'd want that to be straight up and down on those arms and that pivot turn. Additionally, as the turn is, the dancer is pivoting, this leg is back this way. This leg should be back and then dancer is facing this way. So when you're pivoting, you're literally going back to the front, to the back, to the front.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And so if he kind of releases too early, or his weight's leaning out, his momentum's going to kind of go out away from the wall. There's one thing that I think maybe, and it's hard to judge because not having climbed on the route at all, but there's one thing that I think could make it easier, and so that's his right knee does face outward for the move. I think maybe when he springs up and twists it, that would bring his right hip in the wall, he'd almost be kind of going backwards to it, and it's almost harder if you're facing the hold, like your chest is towards the hold, which in this case his chest is definitely more towards the wall, but it's angled more this way, up to the right. So if you're kind of pulling yourself towards the hold, you have to pull so much further, but if you kind of lean your back into the hold in the direction, it sometimes makes it a little easier, and it's a little hard to demonstrate or show on this, but basically what that might do is just rotate himself in just a little bit, so that way he'd kind of be shooting up backwards to this, and that little flick of the knee into the left would kind of bring himself just a little bit closer, and kind of let him spring off of it a little bit better, instead of springing upwards, instead of kind of pulling his weight over that foot, his weight would already kind of be over it earlier, so he could spring even earlier from that.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Notice when she flips the omelet, how the base part of it stays intact. When she flips it over, which will come later on in the next second or two, the top of it is what splatters. The bottom still stays intact. The base of the omelet is still intact. She puts the oil in her pan before it gets too hot. And she's moving the pan in a circular motion, making sure that the pan is nicely coated so the egg doesn't stick. She adds several seasonings into her omelette. I don't really, I don't want to guess, but it almost looks like turmeric. But, you know, it's hard to tell. She had several seasonings that she adds to her omelette. That excess, that splatter, that's from the top of the omelette. She has a nice crust on the bottom of the omelette, a nice base. You notice as she's moving the omelet and when she flips the omelet, the base of the omelet stays in place, stays intact when she flips it over. The only part that kind of splatters is the top part, which is not fully done, it's still moisture. So she got a nice base under her omelet. She's waiting for the egg to start to form a base so when she moves it, it doesn't completely break because she has a lot of stuff in that omelet. Between the vegetables and the seasonings, it's a pretty chunky omelet. So she's being very patient, allowing the base of the omelet to form. She's cutting up her ingredients that's going to go inside the omelette. She has a cutting board and she has a pot on the stove but she hasn't lit the fire yet. She's getting everything prepared to make the omelette. You spread the egg around, just trying to even it out so the egg can form a base. See right here you see the egg is right there and just a little more, just a little, oil is just a little bit further from the circumference of the egg. So she's trying to form a nice base with the egg so it doesn't stick to the pan. She mixes up all the ingredients that's in the bowl, the seasonings, egg, vegetables to incorporate everything, make sure it's incorporated evenly. She cuts very fast with that knife.

We want to see this in the body. We want to see those areas of the body more visible, right? Rather than it being up and down or just here. We want to see more of that definition of the body where the dancer is releasing in the hips, releasing in the waist, so that the dancer can really move and sway. And also, instead of sliding the feet, picking up the feet, pivoting, right? When we pivot, we're stepping and we're rotating around this axis, this point that we've placed on the floor, okay, using that other leg for momentum. So we don't need to slide, but really pick up and place the feet. More energy from the dancer is needed here. More enthusiasm and the movements should definitely be stronger. I believe that this is supposed to be an extended arm that's fully there when the dancer comes out and toe taps. So that's important that we are making sure that our extensions are clear, our extensions are visible. We move our hands with all the way out so we see those beautiful fingertips and those hands and those coming from that arm. Dancer moves subtly through the movement, the choreography. We want more energy so that the movement doesn't look sluggish or look slow, but that it's very clear that the dancer knows what they're doing and they're in the movement. You can have sustained movement or slow movement or elongated movement with power and energy behind what it is that you're doing. You can have clear intentionality and energy behind what you're doing.

Yes, so the core would want, dancer would wanna pull the core in more and that would just give more control and allow the waist to release a bit so that there was more mobility in the hips. So what I mean... Dancer starts out very strongly. When the dancer presses this hand out, the body should be going the other direction, really at the same time, should be quite coordinated. So here, for example, we'd want to see more of a bended knee. And this leg could be bent as well, but we want to see the stance a lot wider for the dancer to have more control, to be able to go deeper into the floor, to be able to rotate in the hips, both left and right.

I love for these elbows to be in just a little bit here. Nice touch. This is really, really nice. Love the arc on the ball. Again, I really feel like he could jump even higher and make it more game-like by preparing. Here's his release. Pretty good extension and follow-through, guide hand. Again, we'd love for him to come down, knees bent a little bit, but he's doing a better job here of holding that follow-through. Again, beautiful release. This is really, really good. Just get that elbow in. But, you know, he's got some athleticism that he can jump, even though he's not really using his legs. He's got a little bit of a lift here. I think he could be much improved. And beautiful touch here. Here's the extension, the great follow-through. Let's get this guide hand elbow in somewhat. And I love this how the guide hand palm is facing in. Here he catches it and again, you know, his body language, I call it, it's just kind of just standing straight up. It's not as aggressive, as intense as you would like it to be. I mean, he's gonna be easily guarded here and not be able to get a shot off. Again, standing straight up, let's bend those knees, let's prepare. You know, he just kind of, when he catches it, he kind of pauses a second or two and kind of brings it down and then lowers his knee. You want it to be one quicker motion. He's just got some, you know, he hesitates, it's slow, and when that happens, you're going to be easily guarded and defended. Again, here comes the pass. Let's bend our knees, drop our hips, spread our feet. Be ready. Be a ready shooter and meet this pass. Again, nice follow-through, breaking of the wrists, get that shooting out, guide hand elbow in a little bit. It's a little bit, you want the elbow to be bent here. Here he's, it looks like he's kind of extending that guide hand. Let's keep it at 90 degree. Good lift here, good extension of the hips. I love the fact that he is reaching for the ball. He's not letting it come back and hit him in the chest. You can see he's got his hands out, which is what you want to see. And I really like this about him. It looks, you know, he's gonna backstop it with his right hand and get that guide hand on the side. He's catching it with the right so he can catch and shoot. And that's what this guide hand is here to help guide it into that shooting hand. He does turn a little sideways, turns his right hip in a little bit. Let's keep those shoulders and hips square to the basket. Pretty good follow through. We'd like it to be a little bit straighter with the elbow in under the basketball. Here the shooter again is shooting a 15-footer. Here in the ego view, you know, again, good extension here. The elbow's out just a tad, and the father's a little cross his body, but not too bad. The guide hand's on the side, but, you know, you really don't want them crossing each other. Let's get the, you know, let's let them be side by side. Let's get this elbow in so that forearm is parallel to the floor. Again, I would love for this guy to be more of a ready shooter. You know, his preparation before the shot is key for to being more, a more effective jump shooter. Nice jumper here, beautiful follow-through. Elbow, get that elbow in here, love his guide hand on the side. Starting to get a little air here under his feet, which is good. Here's the release. He really cocks this arm back. I'd get that shooting elbow in a little bit, but you know he gets the ball up high which is good and you could see it in in the ego view here. Again, here's how he prepares. A point of emphasis would be to step back, move your feet a little bit, and step into this pass. Again, this is really nice. He's got a really, really nice, I call it touch. Touch meaning extended elbow, beautiful breaking of the wrist. That guide hand is not shooting the basketball. It's doing what it's supposed to be doing. Pretty good, pretty good shot. Good looking shot here. Again, but he does, you know, pull the ball up. It might be a little bit behind his head here, but he does a great job of lifting it up for the shot. Here, he's going to extend up his legs and start to lift a little bit. I really feel like he could get more power from his legs if he would prepare a little bit, but doing a good job of getting the ball up to the height. You know, you wanted to release it as high as possible. Again, this is what I'm talking about, the readiness, the preparation to be a great shooter. It's about moving without the basketball. So even in this drill, ideally to make it game-like, which you want drills to be game-like, you know, I would really get him to step into this pass. Here comes the pass. But he's standing straight up. His knees are locked out. I would love for him to step in maybe left, right, and catch and elevate and use the strength of his legs to give him power to lift. You want to be able to jump and shoot over the defense. That's what has to happen.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This one because the climber needs to let some time to pass for the climber to gain height when on the jump. And once the center of gravity is transferred over to the highest foot, then the climber will boost the jump by pressing on the right foot. But if it's pressed early, it can throw off the climber's center of gravity from the direction that he needs to go. And as we can see, the climber was able to land the hand on the hold. This is exactly where the climber was aiming to go to since the beginning. And he, in order to sustain the grip, as we can see, this is a big jug. So it has a white lip and the climber is able to slide the fingers behind the lip of the hold and places the thumb underneath to make a pinch. So in order for the climber to sustain this placement, he will need to create friction between the skin that are the fingertips when the climber gets to curl the hand inside of the hold and also apply weight, trying to remain underneath the hold in order to sustain himself from swinging and also apply pressure at the hold. Here we can see the climber swinging left to right. This is because the climber is building momentum to commit to the jump. Once the climber is in the air, he will have to send one of the hands up to the hold. This is called a dyno. When the climber is going to be released from the wall, all of the holds having no point of contact for a very small fraction of a second to send his hand to land onto one area of the hold above. He needs to know exactly at what area he will be sending the hand to as he will need to rely on it once making the reach. if the climber was going to try this again he needs to make sure that he gains a bit more height before pressing on the right foot to boost the jump. This is because the climber was being taken away from the wall when performing on the boost of the right foot being engaged. So that's so the climber when he's going on the right direction close to the wall he needs to make sure that also he brings the chest even closer to the wall in that case to bring the hips to follow along when on the jump. The climbers force of the jump and boost with the right foot was greater than the climbers power grip. As we can see his left hand who was just placed has slipped off from the hold so the climber here will be detached and the climb will be over as he will land on the mat. Here the climber is shaking his hands and this will help the climber not only to just warm up but to also release any tension that the climber has had built up on his hands from previously climbing. Here the climber was able to send the left hand to match on the dyno hold. In this case the climber is sustaining to a jug. As we can see the climber is able to wrap the hands around the edge of the hold and he sends the both of the hands to secure the grip. This because the climber center of gravity is being driven away from the wall while on the swing. As we can see the climber keeps the feet up so he's not able to touch the ground. Since the climber is continuing to go out it's important that he keeps a very tight grip. However if he continues to go out the force of the pull will be going in the contrary of where he's supposed to be under the hold in order to sustain pressure. So this is a matter of the climber sustaining a good grip in order to not slip off the hold. As the climber gains height on the jump, we can see that the climber had pressed hard first on the left toe. This one was placed against the wall so the climber can then aim for direction to remain underneath the hold when being pushed. Now that the climber is with the chest parallel where his grips are, the climber will have to from here engage in a forceful pull up to bring his chest close to the wall. That way when the climber is going out on the leap, the climber is able to stay close to the wall when on the jump. Here the climber is starting at a two hand hold start meaning that both of the hands have their own hold and the two type of holds they are called donuts because the climber needs to place both of the hands inside the hole of the hold and in this one he uses the bottom area of the donut. The left hand is slightly different to the right hand being more positive. The left hand is more flat on the inside so the climber will need to curl the fingertips only behind that small groove and contrary to the right hand we can see how the groove is more open so the climber has a more positive grip onto the right hand and applies thumbs in the outside to apply grip power by pressing on the hold. Now the climber in order to apply pressure onto the grips he leans back on the holds and the climber to get started on the climb he will need to place the feet onto the wall as we can see the left foot is applied against the wall and the right toe is applied onto a hold that he is placing right now. He's entire front toe box of the sole meeting the surface of the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Again, I would encourage these dancers to continue to practice because they're not clapping on the rhythm and that is an extremely important skill to be able to have for this basic choreography and to demonstrate it with efficiency. More practice is needed for this entire section to make sure that it's moving, the dancer's moving with precision, but also they are staying on the beat. So practicing that while making sure when you practice, you engage your core and you are in a deep plie will improve the overall quality of this movement, but also making sure that they'll be able to execute it efficiently. I'll repeat my previous comment about releasing tension in the hands. I would encourage the dancer to really think about making sure that they're on the rhythm and embodying this musicality and having this steady buoyancy through the balls of the feet that reverberates through the entire body while they're beginning this basic choreography. The dancer has this great buoyancy, but notice how they are coming all the way up and then bending all the way down. They should bend really far up, far down, and then they should come only up about halfway. So they're constantly in plie. It's just are you in a deep plie or are you in a kind of a light plie, right? Having that kind of small bounce and small buoyancy will allow them to move efficiently and maintain a great range of motion throughout instead of wasting energy going all the way up to straight legs and then back down to plie, which again would help with the agility and efficiency of the overall dance. Notice how the dancer is holding tension throughout their fingertips and their hands in kind of these awkward positions So I would encourage them to let go And shake their hands out and let make make sure that the energy doesn't stop at their fingers at their wrists But it goes all the way out to their fingertips So it doesn't look as awkward or stiff This is a nice attempt from the dancer. I would encourage them to improve this movement to have more hustle and attack and really move faster and they can do that by engaging their core and really pli\u00e9ing and bending their legs even further so they have a greater range of motion to move from but they also have core and center control to be able to move quickly and efficiently and with precision.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Again, player utilizing incorrect technical action in terms of rolling his right foot from the inside over the ball. So surface of the foot is using a lot of the bottom part of the foot. So when we're using the sole of the foot, we want to really utilize the balls of the feet. So a soft light touch so we're not fully planting our foot on the ball, losing balance and control. We can also see that the player's not really moving his left foot as he's utilizing this specific technique. So as he's rolling the foot over the ball and away, the stance of the player becomes wider so then we lose elements of balance, control, and lose the ability to now move the ball and change direction and travel wherever we want to go at speed. Body position, very upright and high, so any dribbling action, turn, skill we're going to utilize, we're always going to want to look for the player to be low to the ground, bending the knees, low hips, body moving in the direction we want the ball to go. A player again is dribbling action, he is more shuffling the ball with the inside of his feet than necessarily dribbling. When we're dribbling we want to keep the ball close, small touches, but we want to be moving in a fluent action on the balls of our feet. If we're going to change direction with the inside of the foot it will be a purposeful change. If we're going to dribble we want to utilise the laces where we try and get our toe down heel up. As you can see again the player is again straight legs, upright body position, so we're going to get lower to the ground, bend his knees, lower his hips, lower central gravity, better balance, better control, getting his body leaning towards where the ball is going to go with a set outcome and a technical choice made. Again, the player is just utilizing the sole of the right foot to roll it from the inside to the outside. Again this is going to move the ball away from the body, not moving his body with the ball and obviously as we roll that right foot across the ball, we're now going to be in a more extended stance which is going to lose balance, lose control, lose the ability to change direction and speed. So if the left foot was moving with the right foot then maybe it's a technique that the player is used to using but not the technical choice I would expect the player to utilize at his level especially or any player because we're placing that right foot now in the way of the ball, we're not really moving with the ball, our body is in a very upright position so we want to try and bend these knees, hips up, we want to make the correct technical choice based on where we're looking to go and the direction that we want to travel with. Player changing the direction with the inside of the right foot so the ball is coming across and his next touch is going to take him forward. So the player here as the ball is travelling from left to right we can see if foot position heel up, toe slightly down, making contact with the side of the ball but if our toe is pointing down to the ground then we're not making contact with the middle of the ball and having full control. We can also see the player with a straight leg reaching for the ball so that's going to lead to a lack of balance, lack of control as we change direction. Ideally we want to be moving our feet across and if we're going to utilise our right leg to change direction we want to see a slight knee bend, toe curled slightly up through the middle of the ball so we can really change direction and push off with the left leg in a position where we can move quickly. We can also see the player's body position is facing to the right. As we're making contact with the ball to come this way we already want to see our body starting to turn and move in the direction with the ball so we can effectively change direction with speed and with balance. Just general dribbling action for the player. Ideally we want to be dribbling if we're moving in a straight line, dribbling with the laces. So we're moving in a more fluent running technique. If obviously we're trying to push the ball forward, turning our left foot out to the side, it's going to affect our ability to travel with the ball at speed. If we're going to utilize the inside of the foot, then we want to make sure that we are utilizing as much of the inside curvature of the foot with the middle of the ball as possible. With the contact with the big toe area here, you can see the contact between the ball and the foot is minimal, so we're going to have less control and movement with the ball. If we can dribble with our laces, toe down, heel down, it's going to allow us to get our knee over the ball, bend our knees, get our low body position, and we want to try and bring our body forward in the direction that we want the ball to go, not be in this upright position which limits our balance, control, and ability to change direction at speed. Play again executing a little sole roll technique to move the ball from right to left. You can see here the player looks like he's using a little bit close to the balls of the feet but still a big surface connected to the ball. We want to try and make sure that as we're rolling the ball across our body that we're in a position where it's a light soft touch and we can move that foot then in behind the line of the ball to allow it to roll. You can see the player is starting to move his body to the left which is positive. So as he's moving the ball across we want his left leg to be moving behind the line of the ball for the next action. Again, utilizing the sole of the foot to move the ball from inside of his body to out. Again, sole of the foot, we want to use the balls of the feet, not the full bottom surface of the foot. The player here is rolling the ball from the inside of the ball to the outside of the ball, which is a very complicated technique. And I'd say at the player's level, not the correct technique for this player. We see the left foot planted very firmly to the ground, rooted through that standing foot. So as he rolls the right foot across the ball, he's now going to extend his stance, which is going to lead to the player's ability to lose balance and not be able to change direction quickly with the ball. So we want to make sure that we're utilizing the correct technical action in the specific moment that the player is looking to change direction and dribble with. Again, just following up with the technique choice to roll the right foot from the inside to the outside of the ball. So rolling it this way, you can see for the player to regain balance effectively, he's now moving his right leg further outside the line of the ball, he's keeping his left foot planted to the ground, so he's not even moving his left foot with the ball. So now we end up with this extended stance. So with the feet so far apart, the feet planted to the ground, the body obviously still leaning left as the ball's going right, we're off balance, we're not able to move with the ball, change direction with the ball effectively, maintain our balance or develop any speed or quality in the dribbling action. Player again looking to utilise the sole of the foot to roll the foot from the inside to the outside. The change here to some of the prior actions, as you can see the left foot is not fully planted to the ground so as he's rolling the ball across the player's body is at least moving with it so he's not extending this stance. So he's rolling the ball out, body is moving slightly with it but we're still in a somewhat upright stance so our ability to balance, control the ball, change direction effectively is slowed down. Unwaith eto, mae'r chwaraewr yn defnyddio'r s\u00f4l ei chwaith i'w mynd i'r b\u00eal, felly yn ei r\u00f4l o mewn i'r ffwrdd.

Felly nid oes gennym dyluniadau o gyfathrebu ar ein byd, cyfathrebu ar y b\u00eal, o ran, Pa ffordd y byddwn yn mynd, lle y byddwn yn mynd i newid y ffordd i gael cyfathrebu, cyflym a chyhoeddi. Player here just doing a little Cruyff type skill, but again we can see player not very well balanced with his body position, very upright. If we're going to utilize the Cruyff turn, we want to be much lower to the ground, just like any dribbling action, bend our right knee, bend our left knee as we're turning our right foot inside to make contact with the front of the ball. We want to see the body nice and low, hips lower, body starting to turn towards the direction that we want to go, so as that ball comes out of our feet we can move onto the ball. Player being in a very upright position, very difficult for the player to maintain balance, control, change direction with speed. Player utilizing the sole of the foot to change the direction of the ball. Generally if we're looking to move the ball to the right hand side we're going to want to utilize the outer laces part of the foot or the left foot to change direction. If we're rolling our right foot from the inside of the ball to the outside over the top of it our foot's naturally going to be planted in the way of the ball. It's going to make it more difficult for us to regain our balance and change direction the way that we want to go with speed. So the selection of the technique is not the desired one and it's going to lead to the player slowing down, not having maximum balance or having the ability to change direction at speed and under control. Again, just finishing off the action as the player finishes rolling his right foot over the ball. We can see now he's looking to regain his balance, has to plant his right foot in the ground. Ball is really stuck under his feet. We always want to try and keep the ball out in front of us so we can move with it. Again this extended stance means the player is off balance. So if we don't have balance we can't move with the ball. Be upright and not really able to move anywhere with the ball fluently. The player is demonstrating a little sole roll skill with his right foot to bring the ball across his body from right to left. We'll see the player relatively flat footed, so we want to remain on the balls of our feet. When dragging the ball with the right foot, we want to make sure we're utilising the balls of our feet, not the full flat surface of the foot. This is going to impact our balance, our movement, our ability to control and move with the ball at speed. The action to move from the right top of the ball to the left is fine, but obviously a lot of contact between the front of the ball, which is going to impact the quality and control of the skill itself. Body position, relatively upright, so we want to make sure that as we're changing direction, our body is moving with it, trying to keep as low to the ground as we can with low hips, bending our knees so our centre of gravity is lower, better balance, better control. We can see the player changing direction, so the player has executed a little step over but now as the player is looking to change direction, so coming from there and coming around we can see the player looking to utilise the inside of the right foot to freeze the ball, stop the ball. We can see that he's more planting his foot to the ground to stop the ball from rolling rather than making contact with the ball to change direction. We can see again in a very upright position, we want our knees to be bent, hips low, body turning so as this right foot is turning to hit the ball or to make contact with the ball we fully expect these hips to be turning, the body to be turning as he's making contact with the ball so he can now change direction with more fluency and more speed. Right now his body is obviously twisting to face forward as he's making contact with the ball so now we're going to stop the ball but now we're going to have to take more time, more steps, more touches to change the direction of the ball and maintain a fluent dribbling action. Player dribbling with the inside of the left foot, slightly better position with the inside of the foot and the knee. So if we're gonna travel in this direction, we wanna make sure that we're trying to get our knee over the ball and leaning towards the direction we wanna go. This is gonna help in terms of our body position, turning to go where we wanna go. Player not in necessarily full balance and control. We can see his right foot, still pretty planted to the ground and away from where he wants to go. So ideally, if we're gonna go with this left foot on the inside, we wanna be on the balls of our feet, bend this right knee, get our hips low to the ground so we can dribble and effectively move with the ball in the same moment that we've been making contact with. And we see here the end of the action, the ball doesn't really travel out of our feet, so the contact with the ball, the balance of the player. When we're changing direction, we want to be able to move the ball out of our feet so we can move onto it, not keep the ball close to our feet. You can see how far underneath the body the ball is, so it's going to make it additionally difficult for the player to move at speed, separate from defenders and create space for himself. The player just dribbling from a forward direction, looking to stop the ball as he's looking to move the ball back inside the area. It's important when we're looking to stop the ball, we're not planting our full foot on top of the ball. That's going to affect our balance, our ability to manipulate the ball. We want to utilize the balls of the feet on the top of the ball to be able to stop it, to change the direction of the ball and move it. You can see as the player is slowing down to stop the ball. Again, the player is in a very upright position, so when he changes direction and looks to move with the ball, it's going to make it harder for him to change direction with balance and speed. So, we want to try and stop the ball when the ball is out in front of us. Bend this left knee, get our hips lower, body in a position where we're able to stop the ball, pull the ball back or change direction with the ball. And player in a drilling action with the right foot. We can see here the player just looking to regain control, straight leg, turning his right toe inside to make contact with the front half of the ball. So obviously if we have full control of the ball, we wanna try and make sure that we are running with the ball where our knees are bent, our body position is lower, body leaning with the ball. And if we're gonna change direction to come to the right, is then we'll get our knee further forward over the ball, leaning in the direction we wanna go. But here, obviously the player losing elements of control, the distance between the left foot and the right foot, the body position, the contact with the ball, the player not really matching an outcome with a technical choice. So you see the player allows the ball to travel across the front of his body by bringing the right foot that rolls the ball behind the line of the ball, which is good, and then brings his left foot around the back. We can see as he's getting into this finishing position, again, very upright, straight leg to receive the ball, high hips, high back right, pretty flat footed with the right foot as it lands to the ground. So we lose elements of our balance, control, ability to change direction and have that balance and control to move with the ball.

You can see he creates a good follow through by snapping his wrist his right wrist and as from this back view we can't see the back of his hand so we know that lets us know that he created a good backspin on the ball as he followed through and good backspin was created on the ball as he released it from his fingertips and as you all take a look at his left hand his guy hand is nice and open with the palm open directly to the right which is the direction of his right shooting hand so once he gets to this actual release point the ending to his shot is correct and is going to lead to giving a good shot as the ball is released from his hand. As he sets the ball above his head, you can see that his palm is facing in a direction away from the basket on his right shooting hand. And from here, you can see that his left hand is still behind the ball on the top left portion of the ball. Looking at the legs of the shooter and the placement of his feet does a good job of making sure that his right foot is slightly in front of his left foot. This allows for his elbow to be more aligned with the front of the rim. We really want to make sure our shooting elbow, in this case for the right-handed shooter here, make sure that this elbow is aligned with the front of the rim. He also has good spacing between his feet. His feet are shoulder-width apart so this allows for him to have good balance as he gathers his strength and rises up into his shot. on the release of the ball as you can see his elbow is slightly above the level of his eyes here this view right here you can tell better that his elbow is slightly above the level of his eyes by having our elbows slightly above our eyes on the release of the ball that creates that good rainbow arc and gives a good lift to rise up into the air and then fall down directly into the basket As he begins to release the ball, his right wrist begins to turn. And now as it turns, his palm is facing the correct direction and is facing towards the basket. And now the ball is nicely underneath his hand and he's in a good position to release the ball and shoot the ball towards the basket. Also, he opens up his left guide hand and clears the path. Because before, his left hand was behind the ball. But as he's releasing the ball, he opens up his left hand to clear the path for the ball to travel towards the basket. we take a look at the hand placement on the ball you see that his right hand is more on the right side of the ball as he's raising it up into position above his head to release the shot. Due to the hand placement being on the right side of the ball this forces his elbow to protrude outward away from his body. Ideally we would like to have this right hand over more to the middle section of the ball. You take his right index finger and we'll place it more towards the middle of the ball. That will slide his entire hand over to the left placing it more in the middle of the ball and then that will allow his elbow to come inward closer to his body and more aligned with the front of the rim. As we take a look at his left hand you see his left hand is on the top left portion of the ball. You can see the majority of his fingers are behind the ball. We want to slide this left hand more to the side of the ball so that his hand is not in the path of the ball. Where his placement of the hand is right now behind the ball he's kind of blocking his own shot as the ball is not going to be able to go in this direction with the placement of his left hand behind the ball.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He's got left hand on, left foot, so he's not opposite opposed. And so he kind of, as he reaches for it, you can see him barn dooring off. So a couple of things he might could have done is, you know, same position, left foot on, but then backflag and really pull into this pinch and bounce out or create tension by getting that high right heel hook up over here or even just swapping feet and getting your right foot here and flagging the left foot out. He doesn't really try to get opposite opposed, he kind of just tries to power through it, which might work, but he's just going to have to pinch this hold way harder and move way faster to it.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Here I repeat my comment about rhythm. The dancer currently is not on the beat. So I would encourage them to do their homework and really study the movement and not think about the melody but think about that underlying drum rhythm. I would encourage this dancer to think about the hips and think about, are the hips moving on a pendulum swing, right? Are the hips making little circles or are the hips kind of like, you're kind of showing the front of your hip, showing the front of your hip, showing the front of your hip every time you step with the ball. It's show the inside of your leg, show the inside of your leg, show the inside of your leg, right? This dancer tends to conflate all the different hip articulations. So being really clear on what their hip articulation is and which one they are attempting to execute. This is important because the details, the devil is in the details, especially in dance. It changes the overall look and feel of the movement. The dancer is not on the rhythm, so I would encourage them to study the beat in order to improve this movement. This is important for having that professional quality, especially because this is labeled advanced choreography. Here I will repeat all of my previous comments and including, I would add directionality of the head, using the head as a tool to figure out where they want to go and using that vision, that line of sight to be able to set a clear pathway. The dancer is doing a great job of picking up their feet. I would encourage them to be able to turn more smoothly and more effortlessly, even though their legs are bent. I would encourage them to send that tailbone back towards the ground and plie even more so that they have a greater range of motion. I would encourage the dancer to ground from, ground their energy from the top of their head all the way to their tailbone and send their energy down and stabilize their core and stabilize their rib cage and their hips and their torso and their head and their arms. They're moving too much. You wanna just really focus on the beat and articulating that beat moving side to side, forward and back. Once that has been established, then you can add back those isolations or adding the rib cage intentionally and adding the hips back and then adding the flow of the arms and adding a rhythmic piece of the head. Right now, the rhythm of the feet and the legs aren't matching the rhythm of the rib cage and that upper body. So that's why I'm saying you need to ground, I would encourage that dancer to ground their energy first and really solidify that movement before adding all these extraneous layers, which would help the overall look and feel of the dance.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

They have some nice clarity in their footwork, some solid clarity in their arms, though some additional work could be used to kind of tweak the dynamics of the movement of their arms. And again, they would benefit from dropping the pelvis back, grounding more deeply into their movement, and a more deep incorporation of the pelvis. As the dancer begins with a basic stationary salsa step, moving their feet directly under their pelvis, they demonstrate that they have an understanding of the movement vocabulary, particularly through the inclusion of their arms choreographically, which they're including their arms in a way that is appropriate for the movement vocabulary, makes sense, and is connected to the rhythm. They've also got a lot of nice clarity happening in their knees and their lower body in general, particularly in their feet. Where they would have room for improvement here would be dropping the pelvis back, bending the knees and grounding more deeply into their movement, so that they can activate a greater range of motion in their pelvis and incorporate some of that rhythmic embodiment up through their spine and torso. As the dancer performs a series of turns, she's attempting to spot her head, though could use some additional practice rehearsal or rehearsal in this moment, which would help her to find some clarity in the mechanics of spotting the head. She's also incorporating the arms, but again could really use some clarity in the shaping of the arms and the movement dynamics here. She's got some clarity in her footwork, but this is another area for improvement and again would just benefit from overall dropping into her movement more and grounding her movement more. As the dancer transitions into this basic salsa step where one foot is stepping out, meeting back in the middle with the other foot, and then alternating sides, they increase the range of motion in their pelvis, particularly through the bend in their knees, which is really adding to the movement dynamics here as well as the rhythmic embodiment.

So in this position we can see that the climber is doing a good job of making sure that his arms are in a straight position while he's doing a good job of making sure that his legs are loaded up. So this does show that the climber understands that his legs are the main driving force to getting him up into this dynamic move. However, what I'm noticing is that as the climber is getting himself ready for this position, he's only made a small gesture of kind of like moving from side to side and what's more important is that the climber should be kind of swinging himself from left and right. So then that way he can get a good understanding of the shifting that's going on from his left foot over to his right foot because ultimately as he's completing this dyno, the climber should be pushing with his left leg to transition a lot of his body weight over to the right and then ultimately his right foot is going to be the main foot that's going to be driving him upwards into this dynamic move. And so because the climber is kind of only letting himself go kind of up and down, he's only doing like half the movement, so it doesn't really show that the climber has a good understanding of how to transition his body weight over onto that right foot to be able to complete this boulder properly. And so here we can see the clamber is reaching up with his right hand up into this next handhold here And so what I'm noticing in this position here is the clamber's right leg is off of the wall and it's kind of making itself slowly Rotating outwards into the right while his left foot is kind of going upwards Um, so what that's kind of telling me is a couple things is that he's mainly focusing on his left foot being the main Driving force of pushing him up on this wall However, that kind of limits him because he's he's he's only limited to how far he can he can push himself with that left foot But if you were to push and focus on pushing with that right foot, this would actually help him out greatly Because it doesn't actually place him a little bit closer to that hold he's aiming for because it is a slightly to the right So if he were to focus on pushing more with his right foot This would allow him to kind of get himself closer and into a better position of grabbing onto the screen hold for the dynamic move", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This is unfortunately pretty common with some of these cross under moves where you have to be very careful not to bump the higher arm off. One of the ways around this is to just cross over instead of under. That actually can push the dominant arm into the hold even further, but here the climber just makes the mistake of bumping their hand off of the hold that they're on. We have the climber one move in on this boulder. They're matched on what was the right hand start hold. Started in a hand foot match where their left hand was down here and they brought their left foot up. So they're into the boulder and progressing up the wall. The climber then comes up to this green pinch, kind of deliberates whether they want to go right foot or left foot on this hold. And that is essentially them deciding whether or not they want to go right hand or left hand into this purple hold. They decide to bump past the green hold and go left hand up to the purple pinch.

Her arms should be straightened right here. Her left arm is bent. Her arms should be out completely linear in a straight line with energy radiating from her fingertips. The dancer should end this turn facing completely forward. Right now, her sternum and her chest is facing towards the left side of the room. Her eyes are also facing towards the left side of the room. She should be twisting her body forward and this should be inclusive of her shoulders, her chest, her hips, her waist, her knees. Everything should be facing forward. The dancer takes very small steps here when she's moving horizontally to her left. She should be taking larger steps and covering more ground. The dancer's right foot also should be lifted off the ground. So her right leg should be angled further away from her body and off the ground. To be able to do that better, she could also bend her left knee more so that her body is lower to the ground and then her right leg in an oppositional force should be pulling away from the center of her body. Also, a way in which that could help her get lower to the ground is if she widened her legs more, and that would mean her bringing her left foot further away towards the left side of the room, so that her feet instead would be wider apart. By that I mean the dancer should be lower to the ground. She needs to bend her knees so that she's lowered. Her head is still at a high level of really, her head should be lower because as a result of her knees bending. The dancer should not start this routine looking to the side, perhaps at her instructor in the mirror view. She should start the routine looking straight forward, which is where she should be looking when she is dancing. So even though the routine hasn't started, she already should be focused with her spine turned straight forward. Right now she is twisting her cervical spine, which is her neck, to the side. So it's already starting, not in a place of complete focus. The dancer does not execute this step completely here. She is rushing through it and does it do it to the extreme level which she should. The dancer steps leading with her heel first on these horizontal steps towards her left. She should not be stepping on her heel, she actually should be stepping on her toe first instead. The dancer needs to relax her face. She is making an O shape with her lips here and it's just not complete relaxation so she needs to be more confident in herself in the execution of the routine which would show in her face.

Here the climber has made the move up to the next hold and has sent the hand palming over what's a look like a slight diagonal pinch. Now the climber is not holding on to this hold necessarily the right way so that is the reason why the climber is having a hard time to grabbing onto the hold and to do this the climber needs to release some pressure from the hand above to readjust it so the climber at this time is pushing down hard and sending up onto that heel hook as well as pulling and bringing into a hard pull up to release the pressure from the hand. At the same time we can see how the flagging out as a climber gains leverage the leg is being dropped with this toe pointing down. Here it's good of the climber to always be glancing over to the feet. Especially in this position, the climber feels not at a great stance, so needs to extend the stance. In this case, the climber glances down and what he's doing is doing a foot hop where he will hop the left foot out while bringing the right foot into the same foot chip. The foot chip is very small, so the climber must engage the upper body in order to release some pressure down at the feet. And without losing the feet in the slip, then the climber quickly needs to do this in control to release the left foot and let the right foot come into place. Here we can see the climber quickly moving over to the left side as soon as he places the right foot against the wall. This foot is not in any foot chips but instead is used to be extended out and the climber is pushing towards the wall to help the climber extend over to the left side. Once the climber extends the leg the climber will be able to stand up and over the foot that is being placed to gain leverage. Here the climber spent already so much time with going up to the reach on the hold before and then knowing that he couldn't make the hand adjustment he goes for the next hold on route. This one is called bumping up when the same hand has already gone up once and is going for a second time up to the next hold. Here we can see the climber fully standing on the heel hook that was in height placement. As we can see the climber has folded the leg because it will help the climber to create more pressure and stability while in the heel hook position. And the left leg when pointing out right and is extended at this moment which is performing a back flagging because it's folded behind the right leg. The leg that is extended being the left leg is right now used for balance as the climber needs to lean back on the hold that's been supported. So the right side at this moment, the right hand and the right foot is the one that is the base of support. In the back flag which is the left leg being out behind it is sent out for stability so that the climber can bring his center of gravity as close as he can to the base of support. Here we can see the climber has swept feet down below and brought the right foot into a higher stance. This one by placing the heel in on top of the hold first rather than the toe. This is called a heel hook and heel hooks are known to be really strong as it can does as it can do a motion of pulling and almost used as a third hand. Since the climber will be able to push down on the heel and pull towards the climber this is considered to be really strong as is using the thigh muscle during its use. Here we can see the climber chucking up his hands. This will help the climber to have a better grip when on the wall, as well as absorbing any sweat that may be coming from his hands. Here the body position that the climber is on is on the left leg being extended. It's called flagging out. Now the climber will be gaining reach and by stepping up on the right toe. The right toe right now is placed on a foot chip and as we can see the climber has brought the right leg to be pointing out left. This one the knee pointing out left and this will help the climber to keep the right side close to the wall since the right hand is the one going out for the reach and supported to bring his center of gravity close to the wall is the leg that's on flag where he will be using the toe to tap against the wall to support bringing the hips close to the wall when making the stance. Here we can see the climber having difficulties when reaching out left. This is due to the knee being on the way of when he's crunching up to make the reach out left being a pinch. Now this situation of having high foot placement is good for the climber to think to keep it in place when making the next move as well. Not only going for the first move out of the starting hold. But even though he's having a hard time with bringing himself close to the wall due to the leg being in front of him is due to his height. And it's something that the climber then would have to push through by making a pull up position and really engaging into a hard pull up in order to reach out left. While the right foot was being extended and tapping against the wall to bring himself over to the left side. Here we can see the climber starting with a one hold start, meaning that both hands will be placed in the same hold. In this case the climber does by positioning the hands crossed. The top one will be the one that it will be moving out next as the climber glances over to the left. He's positioned the right hand to be closer to the other hold that is at reach, which is a choice of the climber when thinking about the body movement. We can see how the climber also has brought up the left foot in a higher placement and it's already pressing on the hold. However the climber yet to start since it's touching the ground with the right foot. Once the right foot is placed on the wall then the climber starts and then the climber will be able to come off from the starting hold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It's important that the climber glances over to about like one, two, three moves ahead before performing a move. This is called reading the sequence and if the climber has sent the wrong hand over to the hold that she had sent then the climber will have to spend some time and energy to be repositioned. That's why it's important to before starting to climb to glance over and make a plan. It's important the climber always glances down when making a new foot placement. On this one the climber after pressing into the right toe and raising the hips had transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. Now the left foot is the one that is being pressed so the climber while sustaining the grips brings the right foot at a higher stance. If the climber was to perform this again, it's important that she plans from the ground before getting onto the wall the moves that she will need to perform. However, sometimes the climber might encounter themselves in the moves that they wanted to perform and it seems to not feel good. And so down climbing is an option, but the climber needs to do this with control, especially if it's a move that was dynamic, it'll be much harder to down climb. The climber is starting at a one-hold start where both hands are in the same hold. This is called matching and the type of hold she is sustaining to is a large one with a lip where the climber can wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold being a positive grip. Now the climber is placing the right foot onto a large foothold and when the climber is placing the other foot then she will no longer be standing on the mat. Then the climb will start. The climber was retracting the move that she had just performed and this is called down climbing. However the climber did not get to position the left foot towards the wall to control her detachment of the left hand that was out at reach. This one because the climber will go out in a swing and having only one foot placed onto the wall would have been very difficult to sustain her swing reason why the climber had landed onto the mat. The climber after making the right toe placement onto the foothold, we can see how she had brought the right knee to come inwards. This is so that she was able to keep her right side of the body close to the wall as the direction that the climber needs to sustain the hold above. She would need to lay back underneath the hold and towards the right side. Due to the climber wanting to stay close to the wall to manage the center of gravity, to stay close, she has released the left foot to transfer the weight to the right foot being in place. The climbers next move is at reach and sends the left hand to land the grip over to the left side of the hold. Now because the climbing is sending the left hand over the right arm this is called a crossover move and the climber was also able to extend the left side of the body by pressing down onto the right foot to raise the hips.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I would encourage a dancer to take bigger steps and to make sure that they're grounded through their plie. Here I'll repeat my previous comments about incorporating the shoulders and the upper body torso into the arm movement as an extension of the arm movement, rather than just moving their arms, which can oftentimes look awkward. I would encourage the dancer to rotate their shoulders while they're moving their arms to create more fluidity in the movement.

So you can see here with that hand how the three and four are down and the or the four and five are down and the two and three are up and so and you can see how her right hand is lifted up. Her, like I said, her hand and her technique is very well trained and so it makes playing these patterns very easy for her as a pianist. And again, we're starting in a new scale key and the pattern continues. Throughout the section, she speeds up slightly, but her notes are still even and there are... there's no more mistakes than we've previously had. Okay, the pianist begins, she has very good posture, her finger position is very good, her technique, she's very well trained, each of these scales are very well done, she played a full keyboard range scale and her notes and her fingers are very fluid, and she's going up and down. As she starts this scale right here, she is playing it, it looks like in thirds, either in thirds or in fourths. So even though there were wrong notes throughout that arpeggio, her notes, her fingers are flying and like just lightly flowing over the keys. It is making a very nice and warm phrase. Her technique makes it easy to play. She is Her her playing is very well done.

She'll hit a wrong key. However She's going reasonably rapidly and so She could slow down slightly and that would assist in making those very precise and accurate With each version of the scale, she has a slightly bigger interval from, so she started at octaves and then went down to, I think, thirds.

So here I felt like her body control was a bit much. I think she could have just controlled those arms swinging around just a bit more cleanly, but otherwise nice job changing her body position and directions to face the side. So here, right before the dancer crossed her, she's crossing her right leg over her left before she turned. She had a really nice arms out at a T, and then a really nice turn around spin, which is really clean for the ending. So the dancer starts just kind of getting into the groove of the music. She's doing a few salsa steps back and forth, and then also stepping a bit in place. Really nice job using her shoulders, and then also her feet are just stepping really nicely and keeping it light, and her knees are also nicely bent. So here the dancer does a little chasse side to side. Nice job leg spacing. I really like how her arms flow from up and then all the way back. So you see they're in a nice L shape behind her.

And then her turn out into her step to the side just now Really clean turn and then really nice job catching her balance to then face the front So up to here, the dancer took a little step forward and twisted her legs.

And one good thing about this is they were originally hanging on with their right hand and then we can see that they switched their feet so their left foot is on the wall now with a right foot flagging out to the right. And then one final thing that they did right before bringing in that left hand is they really made sure to kind of sit down on their arm and bring their bodyweight directly underneath their handhold. And this further reinforces that they're placing a lot of their bodyweight on their legs which is always a good thing to see to help conserve your energy. And then that way they're not having to pull or engage with their upper body which does use up a lot of energy very quickly. And here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bumping the right hand into the next handhold here. So they are in basically identical position of hanging on with the left hand here as well as utilizing this right foot here. So one thing that we can see about this movement here is that as the climber reached for that right hand we can kind of see that the body started to sit away from their movements and this kind of shows to me that they weren't really trusting so much what was going on with their right foot because what they should have done is really encouraged how much transition they were getting on their right foot by continuing to bring their right knee over the right foot and this will help guide the rest of the body to the handhold. But what we can see is that as the climber was making this move it seems as if the climber was completely relying on the right hand getting onto that handhold to make sure that they didn't fall or you know that they were able to complete the move. So I would definitely encourage the climber to really transition more of their body weight over that right foot to help this movement a little bit more. And then here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing their left hand up into the next handhold here. And in this position we can see that they're hanging on with a right hand here, as well as utilizing a left foot directly underneath their hand. So because they're using opposite points of contact with each other and they are in a stacked position, kind of on top of each other, this does naturally allow the climber to really rotate and pivot around those two points. So what we can see the climber doing is they're rotating their body so the left side of the body is getting closer to the wall. And this helps to get them closer with that left hand to make this movement a little bit easier. And then on top of that we can see that the climber is utilizing a right flagging foot. And this helps to push and press off the wall so then that way they can continue further that rotation that they're doing. And again, like I've been mentioning, it helps to really distribute all of their body weight on their left foot. So then that way they can help prevent any foot slipping from occurring. Just because more of the body is placed on it so there's more friction on that and it reduces the amount of slipping that can occur. And so here we can see that after the clamor was able to match that left hand, they're now bringing over the right hand into the final handhold here. And in this position, we can see that they're hanging on with that left hand there, and they do have a pretty high right foot. One thing that I'm noticing about this move is that as they're transitioning over to the right, we can see that the left foot was pretty high, and now they're allowing it to kind of flag down into the right. So it's by allowing that left foot to kind of naturally flag and hang down underneath them, it's actually helping to provide them with the momentum that they need to hang on to their holds, and so they can comfortably reach over into that right handhold. So this is kind of a good natural position to see from the climber, just because we can kind of see that they're placing a lot of body weight on their right foot, and they're allowing their natural momentum to take place, so they can kind of guide themselves in the direction they need to go. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing their right hand over into this orange hold here. And we can see that the climber worked their hand all the way around to the right side of the handhold, which is the best part of the handhold. So it's very smart of the climber to really utilize the best part of the handhold, because we can see that they're kind of wrapping around the corner of the hold right there, which helps them to really engage the handhold. And in this position, we can see the climber was able to use a left hand, and then they were using a really low right foot here, and then they also were able to use a left foot. So I kind of like the way that they utilize their position here, because with that high left foot, it helped to really push their body weight over to the right to ensure that they could reach over to that right handhold. The only thing I don't really like so much is how low the right foot is in this position, because we can see that the leg is basically in a full extension right here. And by getting their legs in a full extension there, they're no longer placing too much body weight on their leg, and they're completely putting more body weight on their upper body, because we can see that their left arm, they're having to pull on it a little bit more. And I would kind of argue that if that right foot slipped off the wall, it would cause their right arm to go into flexion, so then that way they can prevent any swinging from occurring. So I would always encourage climbers to really make sure they pay attention to how long some of these moves might be for them. And I would actually encourage to place their feet in a higher position before committing to hand moves to prevent extended positions like this that could result in a foot slipping. So here we can see the climber was able to make the first move of bringing the right hand over into the next handhold here. I mean the way the climber was able to do that was by hanging on with the left hand here and then in the starting position we did see that the climber placed a left foot as well as a right foot kind of below both together really close and so as the climber was able to make the next move of bringing the right hand over we could see that the right foot kind of just slipped off the wall so it's kind of now hanging off of the wall right here so the climber was forced to only be able to place their body weight on their left foot. So one thing I would always encourage climbers especially kind of in any movement was to really allow themselves to fully weight at least one foot on the wall and that I would always encourage to flag the other foot and by flagging the foot it helps to coordinate their body so that they can further place their body weight on the one foot that's making contact with the wall and in this way that also allows them to rotate and pivot around that singular foot. So what probably ended up happening is as the climber reached up for the right hand they try to turn their body around the two feet that they have because we could see that their right side of their body kind of rotated closer to the wall here and as they pivoted and turned in that direction that caused the right foot to come off the foothold that it was on so it's always a sudden shift or sudden loss of a foot that could cause an increased body weight especially on their hands I mean could result in a fall so I would always encourage climbers to try and focus on placing their feet on one foot on the wall and then flagging with the other to try and prevent that foot slipping from occurring. And then here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing their left hand right into this position here. And then what we can see is they were hanging on with their right hand and they were able to switch their feet so they now have a left foot on the wall. So again we do see opposite points of contact with the wall which is a really important thing right here. And then because both their points are stacked on top of each other, the climber needs to make sure they utilize their proper flagging foot to really control their balance. So we can see that their flagging foot is going down and to the right. So with this flagging foot it helps to place a little bit of their body weight over to the right which actually prevents any swinging going on over into the rightward direction. So we can see that the climber is doing a really good job of making sure that they're not swinging or preventing any swinging from occurring. And then another good thing to see is that we can see that their arms are in a pretty straight position which shows to me that they're really relying on their legs to do a lot of the work and they're not really trying to pull into this position which could use a lot of energy very quickly. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing the right hand up into the next handhold here. So in that position we can see the climber was hanging on with the left hand as well as utilizing a high right foot. And then again their left foot is in a flagging position right here. So again because they're using left hand and right foot which are opposite points of contact with each other, this allows them to have really good control between those two points just because their body is centered between those two points. And one good thing about this position again is we can see with that flagging foot it's helping to really distribute a lot of their body weight on top of that right foot. So they can really control what's going on with it. So in the movement we could see that the climber was doing a good job of transitioning their body weight over that right foot by guiding that right knee over and along the foot. And to make sure that the knee is kind of parallel to the wall as opposed to pointing straight into the wall. Because if they pointed it straight into the wall it would make it hard for them to really transition over to the right. So the key is allowing their hips to be open and making sure that their right knee is parallel to the wall as they continue this movement. And so here again, we can kind of see in the first person image that both feet are now hanging off the wall And again that kind of happened just because the climber did experience a right foot kind of slipping off the foothold Because originally they did have a right foot somewhere around in this area and they did also have a left foot out and to the left and it did look like the climber was ready getting ready to move into the next handhold and As they did that the right foot again slipped off of the foothold So then again this kind of shows to me that the climber isn't really Distributing their body weight appropriately as much as they need to be to prevent their feet from slipping off the wall Because again by allowing the feet to slip off the wall it immediately places a lot of extra body weight on their hands So we can see that as the climbers now has both feet off the wall They're being forced to completely hang on their hands. And again, this can make them very tired very quickly So I'd always encourage climbers to really make sure they pay attention to where the feet are being placed and how their body weight is being Distributed on it", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This is a really fun and entertaining performance to watch so really enjoying it so far. So here I like that he is playing around with the music a bit. He started bopping his head back and forth as the music is kind of scatting. So instead of stopping, they kept going and just kind of played around with the music and improvised a bit of a moment, which looks really good. And here they're both doing kind of a rock step triple step as she swings out to the side and back in. Again, remaining connected through their hand holding and then also the bounce and movement that they're doing. So really nice job. While he's doing kind of a step jump to the side, she's able to swing out and move out. So they're doing something different but they're staying on the same beat and rhythm and they're keeping the same swing bounce in motion. So really nice. So here he's doing kind of what I call like a chicken dance where he is stepping on the balls of his feet and then his knees are bent out and he's just kind of rocking his knees back and forth. Here she is swinging out and he's able to hold her up as she kind of leans back in this moment. So really nice job working together here. So there's a nice moment where they are mirroring each other's steps as he steps with his right, she's stepping with her left, and they look identical as if they're facing each other in a mirror. So here I would say when they were just holding and she was standing in front, really watch the arm, the hand holding here. I would say make it a bit more secure. It just looks a bit loose and kind of free, so you really want to give that placement of the hands. So a really nice start. They both have the same level of energy. They're both moving their feet quickly and staying light on their toes. So really nice opening. So here I felt like they really found their groove in this moment. Again, walking more in sync together as they step here. Opposite legs are stepping out, so they appear to be mirror to each other in this step. So I will say I would try not to have so much tense, so much of a tense feeling in there when they're pulling each other, cause it just kind of looks like a push and pull and it shouldn't feel so tense. So she definitely has to just kind of let her body pull in more naturally without it looking like him trying to pull her in as much. So again, when they are out, really good job even though again they're doing different movements, they're staying connected in their tempo and rhythm of their movements, so that definitely helps. And then when he swings her back in, she's able to come back in easily and they connect with their arms as well as how they're holding each other on the other side and just remaining connected. So really nice job there. So like here he is swinging her around and she's allowing it so nice leader follower moment.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She did a really beautiful job of bringing this arm up over her head and then around her body. And then at this last moment here as this elbow is straightened, she's done this really beautiful gentle graceful flick of the wrist. It looks really, really nice and beautiful. Also, this other arm is very clear and distinct. It's just in a nice hand on the hip, very clear shape. She's doing a really nice job getting this sort of back and forth and also up and down bounce feeling to this step as she steps one foot touches one foot out and then back in again. That's she's doing that she's successful at that because she's slightly hinging at her hips and moving the hip back and forth and then um and that's good giving her the bounce forward and back that looks really nice and the bounce up and down she's getting because as she comes down with one foot she's pliaying both knees and then straightening them slightly as that foot comes back in which gives the movement this bounce as well and it's really nice and interesting and dynamic the arms look super super strong she's very clear about where they're positioned she's following through with all her arcs. Here's another example of why this is poor turn technique. She ends up in this super weak internally rotated position Because as she rotates around this hip with this foot planted There's only so far that she can rotate the left side of her body around before The hip is completely internally rotated as far as it can go. So it's just awkward. It makes the turn look jerky Less efficient and less smooth. The arm shape looks pretty good here This is another good example of excellent follow-through and great coordination between her limbs. Here she's bringing this right arm up and over her head and you can see that she's really following through with that movement because she brought it from forward and it's now pretty much as far back as it can go before her shoulder can't turn, can't rotate anymore, and at the same time she's already bringing her other arm up. It appears that she's probably going to do that one over her head as well. Also her torso and her lower half are heavily involved in this movement as she's bringing this arm back she's sort of rocking with from the pelvis up which is a really nice addition to what she's doing here and again shows full body movement. Arms look so strong. She brought them forward and up in this beautiful arc really nice elbow straight nice beautiful wrists and fingers Energy out the fingertips potentially lifting a bit too much through the shoulders very hard to tell from from this angle Again poor turn techniques. She's not setting herself up for very much success with this turn partly because she's Striking with her heel which is going to keep her weight too far back in order to really execute this turn very well And also she's already turning this hip inward which you can see because if we draw an arrow out from these toes They're facing this way, even though the rest of her body is facing that way. So that looks parallel, but it's not Because we're not in three dimensions, but she's basically turned her hip in slightly here Which again indicates that she's thinking about the turn is happening from rotating around the hips which is going to make the turn inefficient awkward Another little bit of a jerky transition here, she sort of stops here after her turn. There's not a lot of cushion and then I mean she has her knees bent but she doesn't really give a nice little cushion to end that turn very well. She's sort of frozen. So again, finding ways to continue dancing through her transitions. Also just want to point out that she's singing along to the music which is a really big pet peeve for me personally. And typically we don't encourage that in performance unless somebody's, unless part of the performance is like lip syncing or something. It just makes it look a little bit tacky and unprofessional. So for me, I would prefer that she just continue with that lovely expression she had earlier of enjoyment. Or it could be multiple different expressions but singing along with the music to me is a big no-no. This movement is very stiff here through the shoulders and upper back. There's a lot of tension through the fingers here as well. This sort of position with the torso is very vague. And also another thing is, again, tension through the neck. So you can see that the curve of the spine is kind of in this awkward shape. So I just encourage her to make this movement bigger and, again, attack it more to keep it interesting and dynamic. Another weak transition. I just want to see more exaggeration, more emphasis, more dynamics, more interest with the arms in her transitions. Here she's losing her balance after she's turned around and that's because of the poor turn technique that I described earlier. A little bit of a weak transition here in these two to four counts. The arms are still held pretty well so that's good in terms of dancing through the transition but again it's a little bit jerky a little bit awkward. So finding ways to keep things nice and smooth and dancey between our transitions is great. Here she's executing a turn and she's doing it very well. She's on the ball of her foot which is a great pivot point for turns and what helped her is that she prepared by having her left foot forward, her right foot back. She pushed down with a plie into the floor with both feet and then transferred her weight onto the ball of this foot and is now rotating around it. Those are all components of good turn technique. Good transition moment here. She's continuing to move through her transition while she's in this shape here. She's moving mainly her arm bringing it up. You can see again really nice grace through the fingers and wrist here. This is a nice strong moment here. And the first thing I noticed about this movement is the grace through her hands. She's got a very elegant kind of quote unquote feminine way of holding her hands here with this sort of graceful wrist and fingers, which looks really nice. And she's holding this position here with her arms pretty well, even though the lower half of her body is moving. So that's a really nice contrast between the two halves of her body. She's also doing a good job with this hip movement going one direction with both hips. And then the other kind of creates this little side to side Susie Q look and looks really clean. She's also smiling and seems to be enjoying herself, which can be really helpful in performance because it helps the audience feel more relaxed. And it's also really nice to witness someone having fun while they're dancing. Another thing about this section where she's rotating her head around, another reason it looks weak is because she's not involving any other part of her body. So basically from the neck down, maybe including the shoulders, there's really not much happening. So I'd love to see her actually do the movement more from here up because that would exaggerate it and make it look more dramatic and interesting. And also this is just such an awkward and weak position with the legs and feet here. She would do better if her feet were further apart and she used a plie to help her have some cushion through here. That would make it look less awkward. Here she's completing her turn. My only critique is that her arms are pretty non-specific and look pretty weak, so I'd love to see something because the technique is so strong with the feet, I'd love to see her also demonstrate good technique with the arms. This transition here is a little bit more awkward. She's done these kind of two steps here and they're both a little bit halting and jerky. The arms look pretty good though because they're symmetrical, they look quite intentional. Her gaze forward looks really good, it's just the way that she's stepping here is a little bit jerky and awkward and looks like a transition moment rather than an important step. So you know again finding ways to continue dancing through her transition. So the basic mechanics of this turn are going really well for her. Basically, the basic mechanics are to leap onto the right foot and bring the left, oh sorry, leap onto the left foot, bring the right foot around the body as she's turning. And she's doing a good job with that. What helped her with that is that she plied through both knees and pushed into the ball of this foot as she was turning. I would like to see this knee straight though, because I think that this turn really lends itself to that knee being straight, so that the viewer can really watch this line being drawn through the air. Nice little moment here. She's brought this right foot out and around and made an arc on the floor at the same time that she made sort of imitated that arc with her arms. It's really really nice, very strong, nice straight shoulders, elbows and knees, grace and energy out the fingertips. This section is about eight counts is really excellent transition again Because what she's doing is being really dynamic with her movement here. It's not very it's not monotone. She's attacking the movement She's also being really specific with her arms and quite graceful again with energy out the fingertips here Great posture all of that. My only thing again is that she is Singing along to the lyrics or at least lip-syncing to the lyrics which again for me is a big no-no Great dynamics here, she really attacks this movement downward with her hand. Again, we can see that she's rotating around her hips because now this one is turned out and so is this one. Again, she really lacks attack here on this kick and that's partly why her knee is still bent even though this is pretty much the height of the kick because she didn't have enough because she didn't attack it enough. She wasn't she didn't have enough music and enough time to fully straighten her knee. Also here you can see that she's got some tension through her neck her chin is quite jutted forward and so really kind of releasing through there would also help a lot to make this look more interesting and clean. Her movements have become small again as she's recovered from that turn and so just really encouraging her to continue exaggerating her movements and really dance through all her transitions. She's also looking down towards the floor. She might feel a little bit self-conscious about losing her balance a little bit. She might have forgotten what she's supposed to be doing but regardless looking down at the floor typically is not advised because it disconnects you from your viewer and makes you look less confident. Again, she's rotating around her hip in this turn rather than the ball of her foot. You can see this foot is totally planted, which means that she's going to bring this side of her body around, which will then lead to internally rotated hips. Again, weak, inefficient, and not very smooth way to turn. a little bit of a jerky transition here as well, kind of a she sort of stops suddenly here, so again dancing through the transitions keeping it smooth and cohesive. Again, she's lacking dynamics here. It's unclear exactly what this little three steps was supposed to really look like. She did move her shoulders a little bit. It's unclear whether that was meant to be a shimmy. It really didn't look, it sort of looked like somewhere between a shoulder roll and a shimmy. So just getting more clear about what the footwork is supposed to look like, giving it more dynamics, and being really clear about the arms and shoulders are meant to be doing. This is a good shape with the arms, nice straight elbows, very clear shape here with the wrists, good energy out the fingertips, really graceful hands and fingers here. However, it does look like she's raising the shoulders using the upper trapezius, which does look a little bit awkward. This is another good transition moment for her. She's just stepping her foot here but she's using her, she's doing a motion with her arms back and forth for one is one elbow is bent and the other straight kind of up and down here. I would encourage her not to gaze at the floor here it doesn't quite fit with what she's doing but other than that this is a good moment of dancing through transitions. Again really graceful through the wrists here. Here she's doing this, it looks like the intention is to do a roll through, not a roll, but an isolation through the rib cage and she's doing that a little bit but she's emphasizing the shoulders more which tells me that she needs some strength here through the torso and practice doing rib isolations because shoulders are much more easier, much more easy for anyone to move because they're such a mobile and loose joint and so a lot of times when people aren't as strong isolating other parts of their body they'll default to shoulders and that's what's happening here. Great windmill with the arms here. This arm has done a good job with this arm bringing it back and around and keeping the arc nice and strong with a straight elbow and again graceful wrists and fingers. And she's starting the same windmill with this arm so it's a really nice counterbalance and looks really strong and very clear. This is another awkward transition. She had her arms up in the air in this really nice shape and then brought her arms down here and sort of pauses before moving on to the next thing. So again, finding ways to smoothly transition between movements and also please don't sing along to the music. I think that maybe she's meant to do a shimmy here and that's kind of happened a couple times where it sort of looks like she's supposed to be doing a shimmy but she's instead just sort of rotating her shoulders. So I'd recommend she kind of work on her shimmy technique. The shimmy is really a forward and back motion connecting the two shoulders together. It's not an up and down rotation of the shoulders. I like that before she begins performing, she actually starts to put the tempo of the song into her body here. That is one choice, one good choice, before beginning choreography, especially one like this, which relies heavily on being in time with the music. This turn looks a little bit awkward. She's turning on the ball of her foot, which is good, while she brings this knee up. It really looks like she's trying to bring the knee up just with the hip flexors rather than engaging her core, which gives it like a sort of, it looks a little bit weak, and like she's really having to do some heavy lifting. So I'd encourage her to really think about it as coming from her core. I do like that she has her hands on her hips while doing this turn. That's a nice addition because it looks really strong and intentional. Again, she's demonstrating good turn technique here. She's turning on the ball of this foot as this side of her body is coming around. What prepared her for this moment was that she was on both feet. She did a plie through both feet, pushed into the right foot to transfer the weight to the left. What's especially nice about this turn is that she's also coordinating the arms really well with it. And it's nice because the arm shapes themselves and the arm pathways are bleeding over from the previous step and so it has a nice consistency and connection and flow with the previous set of movements. And that movement is one arm going over the head and then the other one following. Again, I'd like to see some exaggeration here. What she's doing is turning toward, she's turned towards stage right and she's stepped sort of downstage and she does a slight little bend of the torso here, but this would be so beautiful if she could really exaggerate a bend through the torso and then the arms that she has here could be one above the other and then looking out over her shoulder, that would make it just a much more dynamic and interesting shape. This movement looks kind of weak and that's because when she's got her hands on the back of her head here, the neck movement itself is great. I mean, she's doing a pretty good arc around here like I would expect for this movement. But the issue is that she's allowed her shoulders to collapse inward towards each other rather than keeping them outward, which looks weak because there's not a lot of strength, physical strength holding those elbows outward from her body. So it looks weak. It also doesn't look very clear. This is a great shape that she's making in the air with her arm and a great pathway. Her elbow is straight And she's keeping her wrist in this kind of same graceful orientation and She's doing a good job of arcing that arm up and around and working towards completing that arc Which is an example of following through with movement, which is a nice layer of performance and technique to what she's doing She's also doing sort of a pelvic movement here kind of back and forth as she's moving towards her left, which is a nice touch Because she could just walk across the floor, but instead she's added this little extra flavor to it, which is adding interest for the viewer This transition is also quite weak and I think the only thing that not the only thing but one simple thing she could do to Make this transition more interesting. So this is sort of like in ballet or in jazz what we call a pas de bourree She had brought one foot behind her and then did a side side step to bring her forward I guess I'll say two things that would make this more interesting one is attack each step more She has this sort of in general throughout this piece a sort of monotone There's not a lot of staccato in what she's doing and especially in this little three steps here that she did I'd love to see if she could attack it more one two three Which would give it just a little bit more energy and also I'd love to see something a little more specific with the arms They look quite tense actually like tension here tension here A little maybe attention here. This elbow looks kind of glued to her side So that's not helping this moment at all this transition moment to look performative and clean This is a better shimmy. So I think she does know how to shimmy and maybe defaults to something a bit more comfortable for her, which is that up and down shoulder movement often. But here this shimmy looks really great. Arms look strong, nice plie, great presence. Here she's starting a turn. This is not a good way to start a turn. She's got a turned in hip here. So it tells me that she's using her hip as her pivot point rather than the ball of her foot. So what I'd encourage is to prepare for her turn to have both toes facing down stage, push through the ball of this foot, get their energy into the ball of this foot and rotate on the foot rather than around the hips. She's doing a good job with the arms, nice straight elbows, making this arc out and up. Looks really good. It's a really nice way to end her choreography. She brought these arms in front of her to prepare, which is helping her to get to this position. She's doing this really nice arch with her spine and also imitating the the arch backward both with her arms and also this foot coming back and it looks really really beautiful. This kick really lacked any interesting dynamics. It was a little bit too slow as she came forward with that kick. I'd like to see it a bit more staccato to really emphasize the movement but also emphasize the music. And I think she could probably try to get her knee, her leg a little bit higher. That would also make it more interesting and put a little bit more energy through her ankle. Here you can see that her ankle is pretty loose and her foot is sort of just dangling which gives this sort of sickled look. So it might be a little bit nice if she could plantar flex a little bit just to kind of finish that line of her leg there. Getting into this moment is really awkward. It really is quite abrupt. She was kind of doing this really nice sort of dynamic pathways on the floor with a basic salsa step with a lot of energy and movement. And here she's kind of straightened one knee. She's very still here. And she's also more upright, a lot more upright, but her knees are more straight than she was before. And she just all of a sudden switches to doing this head movement. And it's just really an abrupt change. So again, working on how to keep things, how to keep transitions smooth between movements. Again, these four counts are not very interesting to watch because I think she might be again thinking of them as transitions rather than movements of their own. She's also got some tension through the wrists and fingers here. So again, dancing through all the transitions, not holding tension anywhere, but holding strength and keeping some shapes happening with the upper body would help a lot. Here she started her movement with a kick. I think having a straight knee at the height of that kick is great. It seems a little behind the music, however, so just encouraging her to really be on time with the music. She does not spot her head and I can tell that because if she were spotting her head when her body is facing this way, her head would still be gazing in this direction. The shape of the pathway of the arms looks good but it does again look like she's raising her shoulders in order to lift her arms which is a weak way to lift the arms and is not technically correct. Also the turn is not technically correct because she's now turned out, she's externally rotated through both hips so what she's doing in this moment is rotating the left side of her body around her right hip which is incorrect turn technique.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

But he does have a wider stride here, which is good for balance purposes. I love that his eyes and head are up, two hands on the ball as he prepares to release the ball for the shot. Again, more of a power dribble to get to the rim. Really take a big step with that left foot. He takes really kind of small steps, if you will. Again, love that his eyes and head are up, giving him a good point here to release the basketball. Again, would love to see a more powerful dribble here to set up this shot. Really step long and lengthy with that left foot. Push off and drive that right knee up. It's kind of just a little flat. I love the fact that he's got two hands on the ball as he prepares to pull the ball up to shoot it. Again, pretty good spacing here. Eyes and head are up watching the target. Again, kind of shoots it over his right shoulder. Would love for him to be more squared up. Again, I love how the balls lifted up high onto the backboard. Again, he takes a really simple little dribble next to him. I would love a, you know, more of what I call a power dribble, a dribble more out in front of you that takes you to the basket, and then you follow with your feet. But love how he gets it in two hands to take it into position to shoot it. His eyes and head are on the target. Here the shooter uses his left hand dribble to take him to the right side of the basket for a reverse layup. Love that he's going off the proper footwork, which is the left foot on the right side. He's raising his right knee and elevating. Love that he's got his arm bar kind of at a 90 degree angle as he lifts the ball to the basket. His eyes and head are up on the target. Again, he's kind of turned toward the wall. We'd love to see him, he's kind of shooting over the right shoulder again. I would love to see him square that right shoulder up a little bit and use that dribble to really lift and elevate on the shot. On this actual release, I wish he could have his hips squared up a little bit more to the basket. He's kind of shooting over that right shoulder, if you will. I think he would be more successful if he faced both shoulders and maybe turned that right hip in a little bit. He's kind of angled here, not really squared up, if you will. But love the extension of the elbow and the follow-through to the rim. We'd love to see him be a little bit more aggressive into this movement. I feel like he could get more lift if he had a really more powerful dribble that leads him into this shot, more of a deliberate dribble out in front of him that leads him into this shot. But love the fact his eyes and head are up, good extension of the shooting hand. He has pretty good spacing here to lay the ball off the top of the square.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I would encourage the dancer, they're moving their shoulders and rotating, rotating their shoulders and moving their arms. I would also encourage them to incorporate their torso a little bit more to create a more overly dramatic feeling in the upper body. Overall, I think this dancer could have more attack and precision in their movement. They clearly have the bodily facility to be able to execute these movements, but having that attention to detail takes it to the next level. I would encourage the dancer to plie more so we can see that hip articulation even greater from side to side. I would be very intentional about body placement, especially for these step touches here. I would encourage them to spot so they can whip around even quicker in this term. I would encourage the dancer to take their head as they're sweeping their arms to create more fluidity and create a greater dynamic quality as we have these interesting shapes that's happening.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Now the only place of contact is his foot, so the climber right now is making his way down to the ground. The climber is starting at a one-hold start. Both of the hands placed in the same hold, this is called matching. And the climber is holding the same way for both of the hands due to the type of block that the climber is holding onto. Where the climber must press the hold as a clamp in a pinch position. So, in order for the climber to generate pressure on the grips, he presses on the thumbs down below. And then the climber, once he obtains pressure on the grip, he's able to lean back. As the climber is starting on the first position, the climb will start until the feet are positioned on the wall. The climber is applying chalk onto the hold. He spreads it out on the hold because over time the holds may lose its chalk and will make it difficult for the climber to grip it on. If the climber was going to hold onto it, especially if the chalk is not there, it will become slippery. So reapplying the chalk is good for the climber to gain a better grip. Now that the climber has gotten himself positioned on the first stance, he brings his right leg to be extended. This is called flagging, which the climber will keep extended and eventually tap the toe against the wall when necessary if he needs to keep a position and form. The flagging will help the climber to keep his position square and also helps to transfer over the weight to the highest foot, being the one in position. When the climber is ready, he will engage into a forceful pull up up to the next hold. Here we can see the climber shaking his hands. This will help the climber release any tension that has been built up, especially if he has already attempted the wall, but it also helps with warming up the hands before starting to climb.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So in this case it actually works because their weight is both going backwards. So there's a nice tension here in the arm. They're not doing the same step as each other anymore. Again, this dancer really enjoys pulling his weight backwards, but it's really confusing to this dancer, and it just doesn't work. Really poor leadership on this dancer's part as well. He just decided to start walking around and didn't indicate that very well to this dancer. This dancer is doing a pretty good job of trying to follow and trying to figure out what the leader is doing so that they can get back on the same step. But the leader isn't giving that same amount of energy back. So they're, again, they're on different steps as each other, so they're totally discoordinated. They're doing a good job of maintaining the basic foundational step together here, but again I can hear every step bam bam bam bam and that's because the steps are way too heavy. The pathway of the step is up to down. They're not on the balls of their feet. It's heavy. It's not precise. It just is not performance ready whatsoever. This dancer, the leader, really needs to work on his posture. I mean, the whole time he's kind of collapsed downward. His head is often looking down towards the floor. And in addition to the fact that he's very heavy with his steps and not on the balls of his feet, it just makes this very collapsed, very amateurish position with his body. He's not performance ready at all. They've lost each other in terms of the step. They're not doing the same step as each other. So they've got to maintain that basic foundational step as they're dancing so that they stay connected and coordinated. Good, so this is an example of good leadership. At the same time as he's lifting this arm up to indicate that he wants this dancer to turn, he's also slightly flexed his wrist so that there's a bit of a push on the lower back, which indicates to this dancer that he wants him to do a turn. I think that they think that they're doing something really cool and casual and fun here, but they're so Discoordinated from each other both of them have really poor posture as they're moving around here. Not as much as dancer But he's also like wobbling his head in this way. That's super not precise. He's got this imprecise arm position here I think sometimes people think if they have poor posture and sort of let their arms be loose that they are They look kind of cool and casual and fun But because but you have to have a very strong foundational dance technique in order to pull off a loose weak posture looking Position you actually have to have more control than less control to make that look intentional and cool This is not working for them They wrote really I would recommend not improvising in this way until they have stronger technique and stronger posture All right, so these dancers are not skilled enough to pull off improvisation, and they're both doing this kind of improvisation moment. Neither of them have adequate control or coordination of their limbs, and they're moving from their core for this to look like an interesting improvisation moment. It doesn't look super performative. It looks like a couple of people who are just kind of grooving on their own, and it just doesn't work. Again, another really poor improvisation moment because they don't understand how to coordinate their whole bodies and how to put energy out of all of their fingertips and how to move from their core. Oh my goodness. Striking with the heel of the foot. Big no-no. This is a big reason that their dancing is so heavy and clunky and inefficient. It's obvious they're just dancing. They're stepping as if they're walking, not as if they're dancing. They're striking through the heel of the foot, then they're rolling down into it as if they're just walking. So it's pedestrian. It's heavy. It's clunky. Super straight knees. And in fact, there's a hyperextension of this knee and that's gonna make it even more stiff, clunky, and awkward. Again, they're just totally discoordinated. They're doing completely different steps as each other. It's partly because this person is not doing a good job of leading, and I think that's partly because they're both a little confused about who the leader is because they decided to switch halfway through, and this person has been sort of back leading the whole time anyway. So they're completely discoordinated. They're touching each other, but they're not connected. Again, they've lost each other and that's because this dancer decided to go rogue, but also because neither of them are maintaining the basic foundational steps, so they're not coordinated anymore. This arcing forward with the pelvis as the arm is coming around here, very, very, it just looks so, so weak. And it's because these dancers are not experienced and technical enough. They don't have enough vocabulary. They don't have enough understanding of how to initiate movement from the core, how to have good posture, how to follow through with movements, how to put energy out of the fingertips. Those are all things that they are missing, which makes their improvisation look really poor. Okay, so they're starting this partner dancing in this open position. The position itself is okay. This dancer's kind of collapsed in. So this is the follower at this moment, I mean the leader at this moment. The leader here is kind of collapsed inward. Really he should be more in an open position with their shoulders flat with each other. They're stepping on the beat. They're doing the same step as each other, both good things. They're mirroring each other's footwork, which is what we do in partner dancing. The position though is just very collapsed. In addition to this guy sort of being inward towards the other dancer, they're both also looking at the floor. It just looks so collapsed and weak. Also especially this dancer is stepping on such heavy flat feet and you can actually throughout the whole piece hear his feet hitting the floor. That is just so not adequate technique. It's just so heavy. We should never hear the people's feet hitting the floor unless it's tap dance or clogging. So what he needs to do is get up on the balls of his feet, soften the knees a little bit and also the pathway that he took to get into this step is up and down. So that's further making the movement very heavy. They're both obviously not super experienced dancers. So I think they're having some kind of conversation about him taking over as the leader. I don't recommend that in one piece, switching leaders halfway through. It just, it's confusing to the viewer, it's confusing to the dancers, and it makes for a discoordinated appearance. This dancer is not doing a good job of following. He keeps back leading. He keeps sort of trying to do his own thing. Although this the leader does keep trying to lead him. He doesn't kind of let the other dancer take over, at least not yet, in the choreography. So if you're going to be the follower, you need to just follow. Just let the leader tell you what to do. It's going to be more successful and more fun for both of you. Yeah, again, for some reason this dancer decided to go rogue and just do this big leap onto this foot, which is throwing the balance this direction rather than making a nice tension between the two dancers. This person is the follower. He should be following and he's not. He's choosing to go on his own. So whoever you decide is the leader, fine, but they need to be the leader the whole time because it makes it so they're not coordinated here and it's throwing the balance of their dancing totally off. This dancer is very, very stiff, whereas this dancer is a little bit too loose. And so this improvisation section, again, really, really, really poor. There's a lack of precision. There's a lack of interest. There's just not enough strength. They don't understand how to move their bodies in a coordinated and interesting way. So it's very weak. I would definitely highly recommend against them improvising in this way in their performance until they have a lot more skills under their belt. This dancer tends to push way too much energy backwards at the end of turns. I think that probably he probably enjoys doing that nice big movement but it doesn't work because this the leader isn't indicating that he wants him to do that and so it throws them off balance a little bit too much. just again really imprecise movements with the arms. It's just not interesting to watch. It's very, very weak. It's very, very closed off and not performative whatsoever. They're doing a good job of staying on the same step as each other, so that's great. But again, very collapsed position. You can't even see their faces here because they're looking down. There's no reason they should be looking down here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

However, they're on positive enough holds that it doesn't negatively affect them too much. They're still able to complete the problem. So while it took a lot of readjustment for the climber to make that match on the left hand hold, it was worth it because it allowed them to get their right foot up, and that posts them in a really good position to make this long right hand reach. Because now their foot is already in position to make the next move. Climbers are really struggling to establish on the finishing hold and both beta styles they attempted would work. They heal their toe hook out right if they really pull in with that hamstring. It creates enough balance that they can just touch with the right hand. Alternatively, if they put the left foot in the middle of the hold that they're on right now and sack their body weight really low, so they should be aiming hips underneath in this line, they can just stay into a static position and touch it. Good control on the undercling. Climber has their left hand position on this undercling pocket by pressing off the left foot and really driving the momentum from there. This is a comfortable position and they catch the next hold pretty easily.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He also on the release put side spin on the ball. On this position here we have to be careful not to put too much side spin on the ball. If it spins too hard off of the backboard it will end up hitting the left side of the rim and we miss the ball off to the left side of the basket. Here he put a slight amount of side spin on the ball so it spin and it ended up hitting the inside portion of the left rim bouncing around but it bounced around and inside of the basket. You see here he does a great job of extending his right hand, keeping the ball extended high away from his body and releasing the ball at the apex of his jump. You can see the ball here is leaving his fingertips. Here you can see his hand is nice and open so you can tell that the ball has rolled off of his fingertips and towards the basket. He shows the proper jumping mechanics for a right hand reverse layup by making sure that he jumps off of his left foot for each layup attempt. If you take a look at his right knee, it's not very high. When we're jumping, we would like to raise this knee up to our waist level by lifting our knee on the jump up until this level. That allows for us to gain that upper thrust and jump and reach the highest point of our jump. It gives us the momentum necessary to reach the highest point of our jump. As you see here, he's keeping that knee low so he doesn't reach his highest point of his jump. It's understandable with the wall being so close to the basket. If he jumps to his highest capability, he runs the risk of jumping into this wall. He just decided not to give his maximum effort on the jump. Ideally, when we do a reverse layup, we want to give maximum effort on the jump. As we explode off of this left leg, we really get that knee up high to our waist level to ensure that we're actually reaching the highest point of our jump. On this layup attempt, you can see the ball he places the ball on the backboard outside of the square on the backboard. This attempt would need a little more side spin on it than his previous attempts because it's further away from the square. Since he did not get enough side spin on the ball it ended up hitting the front of the rim and we missed the shot short. So the further away from the square it is, the more side spin is needed for the spin and get and reach the basket. The placement of this shot off the backboard is slightly outside of the square. So since it's slightly outside of the square, we need to make sure that we have good side spin on the ball as we release it. And on this attempt, he was able to get good side spin on the ball and it's spent off of the backboard and into the basket. The player does an excellent job of keeping two hands on the ball as he takes his stride and then as he is beginning his jump and he's in the process of leaving the ground and lifting up that right knee, his right knee and the ball are raising up together and as the ball passes his shoulder area, that's when he begins to transfer the ball from two hands to one hand and finish the layup with his right hand.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As we can see, when the climber was reaching his chest, being at the same height as the grips, it is important that he brings the chest towards the wall so that the center of gravity follows to have the same closure onto the wall when committing to the jump. The climber had brought the feet into place at the wall and the right foot is placed on a much larger hold. The climber at this moment is engaging on to swinging left to right and right now he is swinging out left to drop his center of gravity as we can see his arms being extended while sustaining on the grips. At this moment once the climber had secured the placements he's glancing over at the hold at reach. This is because he will be performing a dyno which stands for dynamic move. So the climber gets himself as low as possible to keep the feet higher up and when the climber is ready then he will swing out over to the right side push by the left foot to gain direction to the hold at reach and then he will be springing out of his placements to commit to the move at reach. The climber's center of gravity is past his main area of support and he wasn't able to apply friction or force into the grip. If the climber was to attempt this move again, he needs to make sure he places the hand further in. That way he has increased the contact towards the hold. In that case, it is important that the climber tries to keep the feet up towards the wall and body tension in the moment he gets to drop the weight into the grip. The climber was able to make the hand placement, this one going over the edge of the hold. It is important that the climber increases friction, meaning most of the contact of the hand towards the hold, before he gets to drop the weight on the grip. At this moment, once the climber gets to apply the hand placement, it is important that he picks up the feet and tenses his body to sustain the swing out. The climber is applying chalk over the surface of his palms. This will help the climber to gain a better grip when sustaining onto the holds, as well as absorbing any moisture that may be coming from his hands. The climber has left the placements and for a quick fraction of a second he is no longer in contact with the wall where technically he's flying and had engaged on bending the left leg to then press onto both of the feet to gain momentum on the jump as he had released the right hand and right now is bringing the hand to be open handed to land it over the edge of the hold. The form that the climbers bring himself in towards the wall is by swinging his right side of the body towards the wall. That helps the climber to stay underneath the hole that reach and then later on once the climber gets to fully a stand over onto his right side he will bend then boost the jump by pushing over on his left foot. The climbers are starting at a two-hand hold start and as we can see they're rounded with a hole on the inside. This type of hold is called a donut or a pocket where the climber places the fingers as far in as possible where there is a groove and that way he can then close the grip and apply pressure engaging onto the thumbs. Once a climber gets to secure the grip as we can see he will have to place the feet onto the wall and when his body is no longer touching the mat then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It'd be helpful for them to bring up their arm a little bit around so they can play with their fingertips. This would allow each note to be more clear, but it would also give a more comfortable hand shape that they could play each individual note more in tune so that the chord sounds in tune. Again, this is another example that this chord could be much more clear if they played more with their fingertips instead of the flat of their finger. As the violinist is going up the scale and playing up in the higher positions, they're focusing a lot on their left hand and so they're starting to not use the full amount of bow. This is resulting in them starting to rush. No matter where they are in the fingerboard, they should make sure that they're always maintaining the pattern that they're using in the bow and keeping an even tempo. The violinist is doing a nice job of bringing in their upper arm to help them play more at the frog. Because of this, they're able to use their full bow, which is helping maximize their sound. The violinist is starting to increase their tempo. It would be good for them to practice these scales with a metronome so they can play with a steady tempo. The violinist is playing two strings at the same time now to play this chord. Bounce is playing this note with a flat finger. They're still getting the note to sound, but it'd be sound so much more clear if they were able to play with their fingertip. If they were to help bring their arm a little bit further out, their elbow out, they could help have a little bit more of a curved hand. This would give them more clarity. When playing this scale, the bow speed that they're using is not always constant. They always spend a lot to start and then slow down. It would be good for them when they're thinking about playing their scales that their bow distribution is very even, that they think about making sure that there's no sudden increases in the bow speed. The violinist is using their left hand to tune the violin using their tuning pegs. You can see in their left hand that they're really reaching for these higher notes. Now there's a bit of a curve in their hand. If they were able to bring out their elbow a little bit further, it would help eliminate that curve and allow them to play more comfortably and more in tune in higher positions. The violinist is playing this scale by breaking the bow in two parts. This is a good exercise to do to develop more bow control. Intonation can be improved when playing in higher positions. They can think about bringing their elbow a little bit further out to help assist. Bring their hand higher up to help them feel more at ease when playing in higher positions. The violinist is playing a scale. These are common exercises for violinists to use to figure out where the left hand is supposed to go and where to play all the notes.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So it's kind of a push and less of her just kind of rolling over to the side to stand up. Great, so in the last eight counts, she hit each count, each accent of the music really well with the steps, and then ended really strong with the arms lifted up, eyes are straight forward, and then her body is nice and straight, standing tall. So here, a really nice clean transition down to the floor. Because she was already low to the floor as she was twisting her knee, it was much easier for her to slide in. I think with a bit more energy, she could have done an even bigger slide down to the floor, so it's even more smooth. So here she does a little salsa step and then also steps out. I think this is where her energy kind of got a little low and I think she could have brought a little more personality to the movements, really pushing her body to move a little bit harder and a little more full out in her steps. So here, nice job with those movements in the arms, making everything clear and to the music. So here, really nice job creating this shape with her body. Her arm is down, her foot is at a nice 90 degree angle, and her back is straight as she lifts her arm up. And then her eyes are also looking forward into her left. So here she is doing a step where her legs are out and opened up. She's twisting her knee in nicely so she has a good rotation in her hip for that part. I think also by the time of this part she's doing a great job technically but I do think she can add more personality to her movements to kind of elevate the overall performance and give it a little more personal touch so it's not so to the steps that she learned but really embodying and internalizing all of the movements. So here, nice job releasing that body all the way down. Her head is down, crunched over, her knees are bent nicely, feet are flat on the floor. So here she starts. I definitely think the arm could have been a bit stronger reaching out to the front with her left arm. And then as she extends this right arm around and back, maybe bend the back a little bit just to add a bit more of an element. And as well as bending this left knee to then extend her back a little bit more. So here she does a bit of the footwork. It's quick so it definitely would help if she bent her knees more and I think that would help her to do the steps more and get her kicks and footwork around a lot easier if her knees are bent because it'll allow her to stay more grounded to the floor and have a little bit of more a bit more fluency in her movement so it's easier to move in that way. So here she is in a releve, so her heels are off the floor, her legs are straight as well as her body, and then the arms are extended out nicely, and her head is looking, eyes are looking straight forward. So here she does a turn and then steps out with her right leg. She loses her balance just a little bit and I think it's because she didn't quite spot as clearly. So definitely want to make sure you spot so you can get around and keeping your balance as you spin around. But then otherwise nice job getting into the stance. The arm is lifted up and stretched out nicely. So here as she goes into the layout, definitely can bend into this right leg so that way she has a little more balance and stability as she leans back. Her eyes are looking straight up which is great and her leg extended out. Her arms are also extended nicely out to the side and if she was able to bend this right knee a bit more then she could definitely lean her body back so then it's more of a straight line from the head to her foot.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

If they were to find some clarity in their footwork during these transitional moments, they would be able to stay more consistently connected to the rhythm, as well as find more clarity in the choreography overall. As the dancer performs this twisting motion backwards, where they're locomoting backwards into the space while maintaining connection with their partner, and kind of using their pelvis to move them backwards, twisting their foot in front of them while keeping their weight on their heels, they struggle to find some clarity in the footwork here. It would really benefit from finding that clarity within the feet. However, I think if they were to bend their knees a bit more and really drop that pelvis towards the back of the space, they'd be more grounded in their movement, activating a greater range of flexibility in their pelvis and their hips, helping to guide the footwork here. As the pair joins together again to perform the same choreography, which is a triple step and a rock step that's moving forwards and backwards in the space, they again find clarity in moments where they sync up with one another choreographically, which is really where this dancer appears their strongest and their most confident. As the dancer transitions from a one-handed turn into joining both hands with their partner again, they really struggle through this transition again, which again comes back to their ability to consistently embody the rhythm and perform the choreography consistently. If they were to find more clarity in moments of transition like this, they would be able to stay more connected to the rhythm. In this moment, they also bump into their partner slightly, which is benefit from some additional spatial awareness as they're moving through the space while connected to another person. As the dancer begins by performing some basic social dance choreography, or perhaps some like swing dance specific choreography with their partner, they demonstrate an understanding of the movement vocabulary and are able to find some nice clarity in their footwork particularly. They would benefit from finding some clarity for the choreographic inclusion of their arms, as well as finding a greater range of motion in their pelvis through their upper body to incorporate more movement dynamics and find more of a deep rhythmic embodiment. As the dancer and his partner face each other holding both sides of their arms to connect to one another physically, they perform a rock step into a triple step moving side to side in the space, and they really find a lot of clarity in this moment. When the dancers are able to perform movements synchronously, they are able to find clarity within one another as well as find a deeper connection to the music. Here is a dancer and his partner perform a stylized walk forwards in the space. They're able to really connect to the rhythm here together for really the first time in this choreography. They're able to perform the movement together or synchronously, and they're able to more deeply connect to the rhythm of the music by performing this movement together in a way that's really incorporating rhythmic embodiment as well as movement dynamics. As the dancer and his partner transition into some basic kicks, they're kicking their legs out in front of them in an alternating pattern, and performing a rock step to the back in between this kicking sequence. They struggle to stay together as a duo. However, they also struggle to stay deeply connected to the rhythm here. Some additional rehearsal to find rhythmic clarity would be beneficial.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You see he hits the top right corner of the square. This is excellent placement of the ball off of the backboard because as long as we hit this spot for our reverse layup, it's going to hit that spot and go into the basket. Even if we put a slight amount of side spin on the ball, it still will have enough room to go into the basket cleanly. However, if we put too much side spin on the ball, we run the risk of missing it long off the rim on the left side of the basket. This is a good opportunity where if we put too much side spin, it hits the inside part of the left side of the rim and that's where we get that toilet bowl action. Now it's a 50-50 proposition as to whether it's going to spin around and come out of the rim or spin around and go through the basket. A layup should be an automatic guarantee two points. A 50-50 chance of a ball going in is too low of a percentage for a layup. We don't want to put too much side spin when we place the ball in the top right corner of the ball. That way we avoid that 50-50 possibility. He's also doing a nice job of keeping his left hand up to protect the ball as he's releasing it just in case the defense tries to come from his left side across his body to try to contest the shot. He's using that arm to protect the ball so the defender will have to hit his left arm first buying him enough time to release the ball out of his hand and onto the backboard and into the basket before the defense has an opportunity to contest or block the shot. If you see here, the player jumps off of his left foot, which is the correct foot when you want to do a right hand layup. Also he shows the proper jumping technique by lifting his knee up to his waist area as he's taking off for his jump and trying to explode into the ground by him lifting his knee up as he's jumping that creates that thrust and gives us the momentum to reach the highest point of our jump. In this attempt, again he places the ball in the top right corner of the square. And as you can tell from the positioning of his wrist, he put a slight amount of side spin on the ball. So the ball spent slightly off of the backboard in this direction. However, because there was a slight amount of side spin and it wasn't a lot of side spin, it still spent off of the backboard and went nice and easy into the basket. As he's going up into his jump, you see he has two hands on the ball as he takes his strides and goes into his jump. He maintains two hands on the ball and as the ball passes his shoulder level, that's when he begins to transfer the ball from two hands to one hand and extend the ball out in his right hand and finish the layup at the apex of his jump. Take a look at his right arm. It's nice and straight, which means that he's releasing the ball at the highest point of his jump. So the ball, you see here, is released. He's releasing the ball from his fingertips, letting the ball roll off his fingertips at the apex of his jump.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

It can give you a better angle. That will allow him to finish comfortably versus underneath the rim. Great job focusing on the white box and getting it to a great layout point. Right now I feel like he's in a huge rush versus taking his time getting it to a good point. Excuse the hiccups. But now just finishing it properly, gain the momentum to be able to have a good jump. He should start higher and a little bit further out. I think he can get up a little bit higher. He's starting so close that he's not able to gain momentum before his layup. I would say normally start up just a tad bit higher. Excuse me. So that angle won't be so tough. Right now it's a tough angle because he's down so low.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He uses his space nicely, legs are opened out, knees are bent, and then he had a nice little body roll in his chest in this moment too. So here he did a little roll up with his hips. I really like that he bent his knees really well, his weights on his front leg, and just with the back toe up. But he really pushed down and thrust his hips up from the bottom up really well. So the dance just starts with a couple of improvised steps where he's moving to the beat of the music really well. He does a little hip thrust and like kind of pumping his arms and then he does a little square jazz kind of square. It's also step around in a square while also pushing his shoulders really nicely and just taking the nice steps around the space. So this dancer in particular, I really do like that he's not afraid to just throw his body out there and go full out. He really does connect with the music really well and just kind of hitting different nuances that I think a beginner or intermediate dancer wouldn't really get, but as an advanced dancer, he really does feel the music all the way through. So from there, really nice spin out into this section. Really clean turn, kept his balance so he's now facing forward and then able to just stand with his legs out with nice body control. So here for the start of the choreography, he did a little step forward and twist his legs. And then I noticed when he crosses over in this motion with his right leg crossing front, he kind of throws his arm around really nicely. So just kind of giving a big push of energy, just kind of shifting from the beginning freestyle to really getting into the dance. So really nice job just not being afraid to throw his body around to really go full out in the movement.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This pink hold, which is a jug, is really positive. So if the climber can quickly switch the feet, apply the right foot in its place, and immediately lower his center of gravity to pull himself into the wall and push down quickly, without hesitating, he might have been able to stick the left hand grip and support the move. The climber glances over to the right side to bring the right foot at a high foot placement, which he will need to apply accurately before performing the next move at reach. The climber is performing the foot switch. He keeps the left leg to be extended, gets his skull flagging out, so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. And it's the smart of the climber of keeping the right side of the body towards the wall, which was done by bringing the right knee inwards once the right foot has come into place, and to keep the center of gravity being on the cork towards the wall, was done by the climber pressing the left toe against the wall, which supports with the twist of the body, as well as civilizing the move when performing the reach. The climber was able to send the left hand over to the next hole that reach this one placing the fingers into one side And the thumb onto the other to create pressure the climber must squeeze onto the hold as we can see this type of hold Due to being placed slightly Horizontal and onto the side He must pull it in the down and direction reason why the climber will try to keep the elbow as close as he can to the wall instead of being pulled out as As the climber was able to make the transition to the next move We see how the right leg continue to be extended and the foot is not placed into any footholds this is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place and as the climber had brought the Left knee out helps the climber to keep the hips square when performing the move The climber before going up for the move at reach, he had brought the left knee to come inwards while he sustained the right foot at a high foot placement. He lowered it slightly, center of gravity, and bringing the left knee inwards is to keep the left side of the body towards the wall when performing the reach. Once the climber pressed down onto the feet to spring over to the move, his feet had come off the moment that he was able to place the fingers behind the lip of the hold. However, the climber wasn't able to close the grip to secure the hand placement and instead has slipped off from the hold. The climber making the dynamic move, he sends the left hand over to a pinch hold. This time the thumb is placed slightly onto the left side of the hold and on the right side his fingers are placed. This is because the climber would have to perform a move in which he had to wave out the hand in order to place the grip. As this is a pinch grip, the climber must squeeze onto the hold and then pull back immediately to apply pressure onto the grip. The climber immediately is dropping the weight so he will have to continue to keep the arm engaged due to the direction that the climber will have to create while pulling onto the hold which is keeping the elbow out to the left side. However, the climber will have to move quickly from this hand placement due to not being the most comfortable to be on as the climber has limited movement at this moment to perform the next move. As the climber releases the left hand over to the next holder at reach, he has pressed the right toe against the wall with the right leg extended. This is called flagging out and helps the climber to bring the center of gravity close to the wall when performing the move. As a climber right now, main areas of support are his right hand and his left foot, which he uses to gain height as he pulls and presses on it. The climbers is starting at a one-hole start where he places both of the hands on the same hold. This is called matching The way that he is placing the grips is with the fingers above the hold and the thumbs pressed from down below This type of grip is called a pinch grip and he does this with both of the hands in order to create pressure He'll squeeze them to the hold and then pull back In order to transfer over the weight to the grips The climber is sending in a right hand grip. He was able to press on it same way by squeezing onto the hold and applies his weight immediately by extending the arm. The climber had glanced down to perform a foot switch where he brought the left toe to come into place above the hold to release the right foot from its place and right now the climber is glancing over to the next hold at reach. The climber glances down slightly to make sure where his foot is positioned and he's performing a technique of foot switching in which he rolls the left ankle out then continues to have pressure with the left toe towards the hole with the outer edge of the toe as The climbers right toe comes into place at the hold once the climber creates pressure of the right toe coming in top of the hold As he glances away knowing that he is able to apply Pressure accurately onto the foot coming into place then he will be able to release the left foot from its place The climber performs a step-up start where he pushed over with the right foot, his weight to transfer over to the left foot being in place, pressing the front toe box towards the top surface of the hold.

They were matched down on this lateral pinch. And they just shot themselves out of a cannon, which is a common saying in climbing. Basically, they are moving too fast, then the boulder dictates. It results in poor technique on the climber's side. You see they are currently overshooting this hold. And they also just grab it poorly. So moving faster is not always going to save energy. Because if you climb poorly, it's going to cause more depletion. Because you have to readjust and slow down. And the moves end up taking just as long. And here you see the climber getting to this hold, but they're just fatigued, trying to move too fast again, fully stretched out on this hand, not really having a ton of control, hips are sagging now, and the moves that the climber was doing fairly easily are now coming to the climber a little bit more difficult.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Looking at the player in the right frame going into his attempted jump shot, we can notice that the player does well at providing the correct footwork, stepping initially with his left foot first and having his right foot come down, going into his shooting motion, allowing himself to become more squared, creating more momentum for the ball on the release to travel towards the accurate area inside the rim. Looking on the right side of the frame on our player's release, we can notice that he does a really good job of having his follow-through extend above his shoulders, allowing the ball to gain more arc momentum and power to get above the rim, creating the proper angle it needs of dropping through the net. Looking at the player going into his attempted jump shot on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player is doing a good job getting his fall through underneath the ball, going into his shooting motion, and allowing his guy hand to lay flat on the side of the ball, using it just as a placeholder, and keeping the ball in the correct alignment before the release. Looking on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player does a good job bringing his ball placement position above his shoulder to help the ball create a higher release, helping it travel towards the proper alignment and area it needs to drop inside the rim. Looking at the release of the player's attempted jump shot on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player does really well at having his follow through and wrist snap downwards exactly towards the middle target of the rim, allowing the ball to travel in the correct alignment it needed to drop inside the rim. Some improvement the player can make to become more efficient on his attempt, looking on the right frame, is staying into his shot by jumping straight up and down and allowing his follow-through to stay high above his shoulder, snapping his wrist and follow-through downward, allowing the ball to gain more arc, power, rotation, and knees to develop the proper angle of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the player going into his attempted jump shot on the right frame, we can notice that the player does well using some proper footwork. Stepping with his right foot initially and then having his left foot come down, going into his shooting motion. Looking at the release of the player's attempted jump shot on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player's body's momentum is bringing him backwards away from the rim, which does not allow the ball to continue its gain for more arc and accuracy to get above the rim.

You can see the pointer is floating above the first fret and second finger above the second fret of the guitar. Here you can tell there was a bit of hesitation.

So that little deception of moving the ball softly to the right and then snapping the ball back to the left, again is a technique just to change the direction of the ball. And what you'll notice is during this the player's balance is firm and foundational through having his feet shoulder width apart, slight knee bend and really maintaining the ball in front of him so he's in full control of his body as he tries to execute the technical action with the ball. You see the player again is doing a little sole roll with the right foot and this time instead of directly across his body the ball travels more in an angle across his body. But again what you'll notice is the surface of the foot making contact with the top of the ball as the balls of the feet. A soft touch, light touch to roll the ball, drag the ball and then as he finishes rolling over the top of the ball, moves his foot to the side out of the way of the path of the ball to allow the ball to travel across his body and then adjust his body to then receive the ball with the opposite foot. see the players just executing a L turn with the right foot so as the player approaches the ball to slow down player stops the ball with the sole of the right foot as he drags the ball back straight by his right foot you'll see his left foot starts to hop forward a little bit what this does is it creates the space for the player then to use the inside of the foot to push the ball behind the standing leg into the space what's good here from the players you can see is the player is now making contact with the ball with the inside of the right foot as you can already see the body starting to lean and move in the direction of the intended intended direction that he wants to take the ball on the dribble after the turn so it's important that our body moves in unison with the ball to maximize our control balance and speed And the player just executes in a little sole roll with his right across his body and we'll see the light touch with the ball with the balls of the feet with the top of the ball just rolling his foot gently across the ball to make the ball travel across his body in front. See the body's body position is somewhat upright but still leaning in the direction to the left. So that's the direction he wants to go is right to left so by leaning that way allows him to stay unified with the ball helps him improve with his speed and his balance and then as he rolls that ball across we want to move our left foot across and then obviously change our body position to then move back to the right if he intends to use his left foot back across his body. Here the player is just demonstrating a small L turn. So you see he stops the ball slightly in front of his left foot with, sorry, slightly in front of his right foot with his left foot, pulls the ball back with the sole of his foot. As he's pulling the ball back, you'll see a slight hop forward with his right foot to create the space to then roll the ball behind the standing leg. And you see the player has a slight bend in both of the knees, which brings him lower to the ground, better balance, better control. You see that the body is pretty much centered through his footwork, maintaining his balance throughout the action. Here the player is demonstrating again a little sole drag, sole roll with his right foot across his body. What's really good for me here is the contact point between the foot and the ball. So you see for the most part he's using the balls of his feet, the area underneath his toes to grip the ball and roll it across. By using that limited surface, it kind of restricts the contact between the ball and the foot so he's got more freedom of movement. As he's moving the ball across his body right to left, you see the body position of the player. So he's leaning on an angle, he's moving in the same direction as the ball is moving. This allows him to travel with more speed and quality. And then you'll notice as he's pulling the ball across, his left foot will then start to trail behind as he regains his full balance and control to then take his next touch. You see the position of the knee in relation to the ball is relatively close to being on top of it. This maximises the control and shows that the player has good balance and control with his body and the ball. We see here as the player finishes that little sole roll across his body with his right to his left foot. We see as the player then steps behind the ball with his right foot, he brings his left foot very quickly around the back to re-establish this position where his feet are shoulder width apart, good little knee bend there. So he's starting to bring his balance and control. He could probably sit down a little bit further into it in a game context but what we also like is as the player is controlling the ball with the inside of the left to bring the ball back, you can see the body is starting to lean in that way so we stay unified with the ball in the same direction that we're travelling. Here you see the player just finishing off the solo step over technique where the player drags the ball from his right foot across his body with the balls of his feet. He steps slightly behind the line of the ball with his right foot to allow the ball to go and then he steps over the ball with his opposite foot, here the left foot, where he then moves the ball, moves his left foot from the outside in across the line of the ball allowing the ball to travel through and across his body. The thing here is the player is not necessarily working against an opponent or at game speed so you'll see that the player as he steps over the ball is still very upright in his position so there's no disguise and probably want the player to be lower to the ground, disguise the skill by really stepping over and bending his knee in that step over to disguise the skill, get the player to move one way as the ball moves the other and then that will also provide him with the balance and low central gravity to then accelerate away with the ball the next time. I just want to focus on the players dribbling technique with the sole of the foot. So as the player is using this sole roll technique, pulling the ball across his body from right to left, I just want to really focus in on the contact point between the ball and the foot is underneath the toes, the ball of the foot. So limiting the contact between the foot and the ball means the player is less stuck to the ball, gives him more freedom and flexibility with his footwork to move both the ball and his feet. So you see as he's preparing to move the ball from his right foot across his body to his left, you see the angle of his body is starting to lean in the direction he wants to go. So as he moves that ball, that allows his footwork and his body to move with the ball. That will increase our balance, that will increase our ability to then move quickly in the direction of the ball and provide the player with a few more options. You see the player has a slight knee bend in his plant foot, that allows the player again balance, lower centre of gravity, it's going to help him with a change of speed, change of direction, also balance and protection of the ball. Here's a player using the sole roll with the right foot, using the balls of his feet, making minimal contact with the ball just to help with the speed of his footwork. As he generally rolls over the top of the ball, as he finishes the action you'll see he steps behind the line of the intended direction that he wants the ball to roll across his body. This allows him now to plant his right foot and move his left foot out to regain control of the ball. The player's not necessarily moving at any real speed, so he has pretty much control of his body even though we would ideally want him to be maybe a little bit lower to the ground, lower centre of gravity, bend his knees, sink his hips. So in terms of a game situation that change of speed, change of direction is a little bit faster and able to also protect the ball when under pressure. See the player is demonstrating a rollover, a sole roll with his right foot across his body to his left. You'll see the player grips the ball with the underside of the toes with the balls of the feet. This allows the player to stay agile and move his footwork with the ball. As he rolls over the ball with his right foot, you'll see then the right foot steps behind the line of the ball, allowing the path of the ball to be unobstructed. As he steps across, you'll see that his footwork moves his body across to get his left foot outside the line of the ball to be able to control it to then be able to continue to move the ball forward or back across his body. You'll see the player, in terms of his body movement, depending on which direction he was moving the ball, so whether he was going from right to left, his body was leaning right. As he's starting to now control the ball with his left foot, you can see that his body is now starting to lean again back to the right-hand side in the intended direction of the next pass or next touch. I just want to emphasize, the player utilizes the little solo drag across his body quite a lot, each time utilizing the balls of the feet, not the whole bottom of the foot. When we use the whole bottom of the foot, that maximum contact really slows us down, makes it harder for our footwork to adjust and move. So by just taking that little soft touch with the balls of the feet on top of the ball, there's more flexibility in the foot to be able to now come off the ball and step behind it, create the space for the ball to travel across the body. By working on the balls of our feet, it allows us to move lighter, softer, and move across behind the line of the ball as the ball travels. You see the player is in pretty good control of his body at the pace that we're working in, he's pretty slow, so he doesn't have to move an awful lot with the ball, but as he moves the ball, he moves his body in the same direction. here the player just executes in a little sole roll with his left foot across his body to his right and you'll see the part of the left foot that he uses is to grip the ball with the balls of his feet so it's a soft light touch allows him less contact with the ball so he can then move his foot behind the line of the ball and here you see the foot didn't quite get out the way the ball so there's a little bobble over his foot that he drags the ball with but because the players balance and footwork where as he rolls the ball he brings his right foot out to the side quite straight away and the players able to adjust to not moving his foot fully out the way and the bobble of the ball you also see as the player is now controlling the ball with the inside of the right foot to bring the ball back to the center you can see the body position of the player starting to lean back in the direction that he intends to go next Again, the player is just demonstrating a sole roll right across his body. So as he rolls the ball with the balls of his feet with his right foot and you'll see he steps behind the line of the ball, allows the ball to travel, quickly moves his footwork around so his left foot comes around the back to re-establish this good foundation position with his feet shoulder width apart. Depending on the direction the player is looking to go you can see the body is leaning towards the next direction that he's planning to go. So this just allows him to maintain control, balance, allows him to move at speed with the ball as he's changing speed, changing direction. see the player executing a L turn with his right foot so you see as the player approaches the turn stops ball with his right foot pulls the ball back moves his left foot slightly forward as he pulls the ball back to create the space to finish the L with the inside of his right foot behind his standing leg into the space see as the player is pulling the ball back and starting to push the ball behind his left leg his body starts to turn towards the direction he wants to go basically following the direction of the toe of the right foot and the direction that he wants to travel in next that's important as he moves with the ball generates speed and control as we do these skills we ideally would want the players to add disguise and be lower to the ground bend the knees sink the hips so we have better balance lower center of gravity more protection and the ability to now push off from that standing leg with more speed and acceleration away from the defender As the player finishes the solo with the right, what's very important is that as he finishes that movement, rolls over the ball with his right foot, his right foot steps behind the line of the ball to allow the ball to travel. But then as he brings his left foot around the back, you can see he re-establishes a good foundation of balance where his feet are now, shoulder width apart, slightly further. He's not as upright and his feet aren't close together so he can really maintain good balance, good control, keeps the ball directly in front of him. So he's maintaining control and balance as he goes through the action. Here you see the player just demonstrate a sole cruyff turn, not a full turn, just a little chop in between his feet. You'll see he uses the sole of his right foot to roll the ball behind the other standing leg. What I like here is obviously the left foot is kind of hopping and moving forward out of the way to create the path for the ball. As the player takes his touch across you can see his body movement is starting to turn towards the ball, keeps his eyes on the ball as he's about to turn. This just gives him a good visual perception of where the ball is and what he can do next.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

It's not a standard French omelette that would be not cooked on both sides. It would be cooked only on one side and then either folded or rolled. This is a masala omelette which is served in this form and does include spices and raw cut vegetables. He's cracked the egg into the bowl. Now he's taking a spoon and he's using it to blend his mixture so he can evenly incorporate all the spices and the cut vegetables with the egg and egg yolk and egg white. He moves his hands quickly so that he is very efficient at making that whisking movement. He has a plate. He added salt to the mixture of egg. Now he's turned those pieces and is making a cross cut. It's more of a lengthwise cut because of the shape of the onion to break down those pieces into smaller pieces. But he did struggle a bit there to get those pieces to really cut through. As the oil warms on the pan, it will become thinner and move about the pan more freely. There will come a time where he needs to spread the oil, otherwise it's pooling in one place. He's placing the pan over the flame. And then he's testing the edges by pressing underneath those edges with his spatula. Here he's got his small green pepper. It's a long, not very long actually, very skinny little pepper. And he is cutting it into small circular pieces that should mirror his onion slices. That's something, if you're cooking vegetables and you're cutting them, if you're cooking them at the same time as one another, you wanna make sure that their cuts are uniform so that they have the same opportunity to cook together as one another. But he's making those cross cuts and this is coming out as a small dice. He's making nice cross cuts on this. That leaves the shape of the initial cut onion in kind of a mis-formed circle because of the shape of the onion itself. and a large metal spatula. And he has made the flip, but you can see the raw egg dumps onto the pan and kind of creates a mess. And as you can see, the shape of it is not a great circle. It's circular, but it definitely has some rough, rustic edges. That is because the pan itself is so much larger that the egg is expanding out as far as it can and doesn't necessarily have like a confining circle to fit into. He's adding his egg mixture to the pan. His first attempt to flip this is unsuccessful. He didn't have a good enough grip and really it's not ready for it. It's still got too much raw on top so it can be very messy. He has a small red onion. It looks to be a shallot. A shallot would be a milder onion to a true red onion. A true red onion is going to be more robust, but the outside of this is so light purple that it leads me to believe it's a shallot. Now he's tilting his pan to evenly distribute his oil. As you can see, the oil's already moved a bit because once it's warmed, it's thinned out. So it's kind of made a larger circumference than it originally had when he put it in. He's recovered a bit and flipped his omelet yet again. He's having to chase his omelet around the pan and you can see here it's actually touching the wall Because the pan has no sides. He doesn't have anything to use as leverage to get the omelet up He's lighting his propane stove. Here he's adding a red spice called Kashmiri chili powder. It adds a smoky flavor to the dish and is very common in Indian cooking. and moving his onion and pepper mixture into the bowl with the egg. He's using a spatula to spread out his ingredients. Sometimes the particulates of vegetables need to be broken out a little bit. He has a cutting board with a fixed cutting device on it. It's very unusual, but pretty neat. This pan is quite large for one egg omelet. I would not recommend using a pan this large unless it was all that you had to use. It is more helpful when you're able to gauge the size of the pan based on the volume of omelet that you're gonna be putting inside of it because the edges of a pan, this one not having any edges is prohibitive. The edges are very helpful in forming the true shape of the omelet. He's continuing to flip it, which is unnecessary. He doesn't need to move it. It would only need to be once on each side. He's adding oil to his pan. His eggs are already beginning to cook as you can see by the lighter edges. That's great. This interior part that's red is, you can see here better, that is uncooked egg. Some of it's colored by the spice, but it's uncooked egg. So that is still needing to like really solidify. And he's retrieved a large skillet. It doesn't have sloped sides. This pan is more flat, very large in diameter, but it appears to be cast iron, which if well-seasoned can be a great nonstick alternative and a very durable choice. And then pressing the omelet as he's doing here is only going to remove any nice, fluffing air that was in the mixture from the whisking and make it a more dense omelet. So you don't want to do that. This is just over attending to his omelet.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

In this point, the climber had brought into a very close pull up so that she can bring her center of gravity close to the wall when going out for the reach. The climber right now is staring at the next hold at reach and we can see her extending the left leg and the arms to lean back. Now the climber being able to press onto the left toe is what brings her center of gravity underneath the grips. And as the climber is staring at the hold at distance is because the climber is lowering his center of gravity in order to perform a dynamic move next since the hold is at reach. The climbers are starting at a one-hole start where she places both of the hands onto the same hold. This is called matching and the climber is placing the hand to be wrapped around the lip of the hold as this is a positive hold being a jug and when it's really large, it's also called a bucket. This type of holds is mostly seen on beginner climbs as they are do not require a lot of energy to sustain on the grip. the climber performing the reach we can see how she yet to apply the grip over the lip of the hold and in doing so the climber's left foot has popped out of place. This was due to a lack of pressure when sending her hand over to the reach. It is important that if the climber was to attempt this again that she applies pressure of the left foot and in this case potentially the climber was placing the foot over to the right side of the hold and if she places the foot next time it needs to be done over the corner of that hold so that the climber will be able to roll the toe on top of the hold to apply pressure when transitioning out left. As we can see the climber first has thrown herself over to the right and quickly has dropped her center of gravity to extend the arms. This is because the climber is going to be performing a jump up to the hold at reach where she brings the center of gravity low to apply more pressure onto the feet when she gets to stand up and pull herself into the wall. So the climber is no longer standing on the mat and has placed the feet onto the holes of the wall. That means that the climber once off the mat then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

But if you pay attention to the first person image right here, we can see that they're basically touching the good side of the hold with their fingertips right there. So they're not exactly using it quite yet. But in this position, we can see that they're hanging on with their right hand. They do have a left foot that's behind their body, it's just kind of blocked in the image right here. And they're still using the right foot right here. And so because they're shifting their body weight over to the left right there, we can kind of see that they're limited in the full reach. Because the distance that we want to look at is the distance from their right foot to the left hand, which is the greatest distance that points from each other. And so because the climber is keeping the right foot on the foothold as they're completing this movement, they're realizing that they're coming up short and they're unable to really reach the good side of the hold that they're aiming for. So what I would always recommend climbers is to not become guilty of always relying on two feet being placed on the wall at every time. Because as we can see here, as climbers relying on two feet being present on the wall, it's forcing them to be short on their movement. And as a result, they're having to pull and engage with the arm a little bit more as they're hanging in this position right here to try and figure out how to get the rest of the movement. So what I would always encourage climbers is before even really committing to the next hand movement is by placing, in this case, they would be placing their right foot off of the foothold. And it would be turning into a flagging foot that would be kind of extended out into the wall. So that way they can kind of press and rotate their body over their left foot, and then they would get the full distance that they need instantly as opposed to trying to hang in this position to get the rest of the movement going. And so here we can see the Clown was able to move their left hand over into the next hand hold here and in this position we can see that they were using a right hand here as well as a right foot and they do have a left foot that we can kind of see a little bit right here. So in the same instance from their opening move we can kind of see another triangle of position right here. Right, so between the three points of contact and now we can see that their body is shifted to the left of that position right there. So it's always making, always important to make sure that you have a really good balance of what's going on with your body right here. So because the climber is moving over to the left it's okay to shift their body weight in the direction that they need to but as soon as they grab on to that next hold because they're grabbing on with that left hand now the triangle turns over into this block right here that I'm kind of zigzagging into. So now the triangle is shifted over to the left and they need to balance their points in that triangle right there. So what this climber needs to make sure they do is they get off of that right foot and turn it into a flagging foot so then that way they can keep the majority of the body weight between their left foot and the two hands that they're utilizing and this allows them to kind of move the right foot into the next position continuing the movement. And so here we can see the Clammer is making the final move of bringing the left hand over into this finish hold here. And in this position we can see that they're hanging on with their right hand here and they're still using a right foot right here. So because again they're using two points of contact that are on the same side of the body, it does make them in an imbalanced position so we can kind of see that what they're flagging for it's kind of taking a toll on them because it's kind of getting kicked out away from the wall here. So this foot because it's flagging out away from the wall, it actually helps to further pull them away from the wall. So if this Clammer was more tired or utilizing harder holds, this could result in them falling. Luckily it does seem for this Clammer they're very usable holds to finish on. So that's probably why this Clammer is okay with doing it in this form. So I would always recommend Clammers to really have good control of their body and their flagging foot before committing to hand moves just because if they just commit to a hand move it could cause them to become imbalanced and could lead to a fall. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring their right hand over so they're now matched onto the same handhold. But one thing that I'm noticing about this position is the climber is doing a good job of making sure that their left arm is in a very straight position, but what we can see is that a lot of their body weight is kind of hanging out and away from the wall. One of the reasons why I think that is is the climber might be comfortable with the handhold that they're using, but what I'm also seeing is kind of a lack of really adjusting their body weight over their right foot, just because that's the one foot that's on a foothold on the wall. So what I would definitely recommend the climber is kind of adjusting their body all the way more to the right, so then that way they can put more body weight on top of that right foot, and then that way instead of hanging out and away from the wall, they can allow their body to hang down underneath the hold, which would make it feel better, and that way they can place more body weight on their right foot altogether. So here we can see the climber was able to make the first move of bringing her right hand up into the next handhold here and the way the climber was able to do that was by using this left hand here and then we can see that they are using both a left foot as well as a right foot on the wall right here. So one thing I want to point out right here is because where their left hand is placed it's basically right in the middle of the two of the points which is their two other feet so what this does is it causes a natural balance in the climber just because they're very stationed they're very in a controlled position right here and if we think about it they're almost kind of creating a triangle shape with their body right between the three points we have from their hand to the left foot from the foot to the opposite foot and from their hand again to the right foot. So these lines kind of create a triangle and the idea is to always try and maintain this triangle of balance between three points of contact because ideally one points will be always moving on the wall just to kind of progress them on the wall. So here in this starting position we can see that the climber is in a very balanced position because their hand is in the middle of their two feet and this really helps to allow them to get good control and availability of moving on into the next move. So as we see them move up with that right hand into the next position we can see that the body is still stationary in the same position right here which just goes to show how much control they have as opposed to if they were to move one hand into the next position sometimes you can kind of see their body transition from one side to the next and that just kind of shows that they weren't in a good triangle or a good balanced position before continuing into this movement here but for this first move we can see that this climber wasn't really moving around that much once they made that move so just goes to show how controlled they were in this position. And so here we can see in the rest of that movement of reaching over to the left that the climber is now able to fully grasp onto that left hand there. And only after the climber is able to fully grab onto that left hand there we can see that their right foot is now off the foothold in a flagging position here. So this is ideally where I would want the climber to be with their flagging foot before even committing to that hand move. So then that way they can help conserve a little bit more energy and fully trust their left foot to be able to get them over into the move that they need. Obviously this is a little bit more of something to practice for kind of every climber because it is a very valuable tool that helps especially short climbers but can even help tall climbers to make sure that they can reach and fully weight their foot so then that way they're not slipping on any foothold. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing their left hand up into the next handhold here. And in this position we can see that the climber was hanging on with a right hand here, as well as their left foot in the main position. And we can see that the right foot did turn into a flagging foot. So that flagging foot just kind of helps to really rotate the body around that left foot. So then that way they can push off that left foot and get the amount of movement that they need. And so in this position we can see that the climber made a good rotation with their lower body so that the left side of their hip gets closer to the wall. So this is a really good use of their lower body into ensuring that they're using more of the lower body as opposed to pulling so much with their upper body. But we can see that the climber is still pulling in with their right arm there. So I would just kind of encourage them to really rotate their body a little bit more so that way they can help reduce the amount of upper body pulling that they're doing right here. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing their left hand up into the next handhold here. And in this position we can see that the climber was hanging on with the right hand here as well as utilizing a right foot in this position here. Now, so because they're using two points of contact that are on the same side of the wall, again, which is the right hand and right foot, this kind of creates them in an imbalanced position. And what tends to want to happen is their body wants to rotate out and to the right, essentially around those two points. And that's because they have a lot of body weight that's to the left and naturally balance always wants to take place. And what that balance is, is their body wants to rotate over to the right around those two points. So what we can see is as the climber is reaching up with their left hand, their left foot is in a flagging position. And right now their flagging position is kind of down in this position right here. So I would actually not encourage a flagging position in this angle right here, just because it's keeping them in that narrow position as well within the right hand and right foot. So what I would actually encourage them is to flag their left leg over to the right on the right side of the two points that they're making contact with the wall. So then that way they can help distribute a little bit of their body weight over to the right. So then that way they feel less rotation going on in their body. But what we can see is because the climber is having their left foot flagging down into the middle, they are having to engage the right arm ever so slightly to try and pull them up into the next movement here. So because they're using two points on the same side of the body, they're being forced to use a little bit more energy and a little bit more tools in order to make sure that they can accomplish this movement here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

We can see how the climber's left hand was trying to go over the orange hold, the one that was for the start instead of moving over to the next hold at reach. The climber is pressing forcefully on the feet. This is to release some of the pressure at the grips. And as we can see, the climber was able to release the left hand grip. The climber was securing the left hand placement. He keeps the arm extended. This is so that the climber can have some time for recovery and transferring over the weight to the left hand grip. As we can see he only placed a few fingers inside of the hold, being the middle finger, ring and index finger. Those are the strongest fingers on the hand and is pressing onto the right toe against the hold, driving the right knee inwards. This is so the climber can then make the transition of releasing the right hand over to the next hold at reach. The climber had glanced down at the feet to make sure he made an accurate foot placement, making the placement of the left toe towards his small foot chip and his place much lower than the right foot that had come into place much higher. Once the climber is off the mat, then the climb will start. The climber releasing the left hand grip, he then has missed the pressure and position of the right hand immediately dropping the weight. It will be really hard for the climber to recover the move. However, the climber is bringing the right hand over the left hand to be placed. He needs to ensure to apply pressure mostly into the left side of the hold and not so much pressure where it traps the left hand. So that way the climber can release the left hand from its place. It is important that the climber starts moving the feet slightly higher to release some of the pressure of the grips before he performs the move at reach. The climber is readjusting the right hand grip potentially not being the best placement due to the right hand being placed above the left hand making it hard to release when commuting for the next move. The climbers is starting at a two hand hold start placing the left hand over the right hand. For the left hand the climber is sustaining to a much larger hold. As we can see he's placing the fingers onto the right side so he must pull the hold onto the left direction in order to apply pressure. As for the right hand grip the climber places it from underneath the right hand and as we can see he's using the fingertips to be placed over the edge of the hold with the thumb pressed onto the side. With the palm being placed over the hold. This type of grip is called an open hand grip so the climber will be folding the knuckles to apply force at the finger pads. The climber has little contact of the right hand once he applies pressure only at the fingertips. It is important that the climber brings the right hand's elbow close to the wall to apply pressure pulling it downwards. As we can see the climber has brought the right hand to come into a match at the hold. Matching is when both of the hands are placed in the same hold. And presses the thumb onto the outer left side of the hold to place the fingers behind where the thumb is placed. The clamber was able to make the move at reach sending the left hand behind the lip of the hold. This is a rounded hole with a sharp edge and so this type of hold could be called different things. One could be a very small hueco because huecos are known to be big or a donut hold except that it's not rounded like a donut it has a sharp edge or in this case could be a pocket if the climber can only fit a few fingers and if the lip of the hold is shallow. In this case the climber is placing the fingers at the bottom lip of the hold and as we can see when committing into the move he released the left hand that was on the smaller hold which was hard to sustain and it makes sense that the climber was pulling onto the right hand grip being a pinch in a more positive hold to sustain as the climber had pressed down onto the feet to drive the hips close to the wall. The climber chooses to switch the hands to not have them cross over. This was because the left hand was being impeded by the right hand as he will have to make the move up next potentially releasing the left hand since this one is not the best hold to sustain for a long time and the one that is more reliable is the right hand. As we can see this time the climber is applying the right hand grip with the thumb placed onto one side of the hold and the fingers onto the other. To apply pressure the climber must squeeze onto the hold to provide power and pressure at the same time by pulling it back and for the left hand grip same way as a climber will have to press the fingers against a very small edge of the hold with a thumb pressed onto the outside being in an open crimp as a climber will have to drive the palm towards the hold and fold the knuckles to drive force onto the fingertips and to pull in the direction for sustaining the grip the climber must keep the elbow close to the wall to pull it down when transferring over the weight to the grips.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Her energy that she is bringing is a bit subdued. It would be more exciting to watch if she exaggerated her movements more and made things more exciting.

Her hips are Internally rotating and this medial or rotation towards her center or towards her belly button From stemming from her hips is now also Uh, radiating downward to her knees. So that's why her knees are turned inward and why they're almost touching here The dancer needs to be taking larger steps. One's going to travel and cross the floor this way. She could be traveling further downstage, which is the front of the room, and then further upstage, the back of the room. She should be able to do this on one pass.

Also, the dancer can articulate this movement even further by straightening her leg even more. It's mostly straight, but her knee is still slightly bent. So if she straightens her leg even more and continues that straight line through her toe, pointing her foot at her ankle joint, that would improve the movement. The dancer has to seriously pick her feet off the floor. It has to be very adamant of a movement. When she's doing these chass\u00e9s or these triple steps horizontally, she's shuffling her feet on the floor instead of picking them up very obviously. Also, one way in which you can engage the movement further to be more exciting is in this movement right here where she's kicking her right leg upward, she could be kicking this leg even higher so that the step isn't as similar as the rest of the steps. This kick should really be different than the steps she's done previously. So it would require, to be different, it would require a level change so her leg should be higher up in the air. Instead, the dancer's feet should be parallel, her legs should be in straight lines, and her toes should be pointing outwards, straight ahead, so that they are parallel to each other and there would be no intersection between the angles that they're forming. The dancers feet right here are slightly turned in if we draw angles from where her feet are pointing they would intersect So her feet shouldn't be ever in this turned in position", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Perhaps because his stamina is getting a little bit lower as he continues to repeat this step, he's really falling off the rhythm and moving at a significantly slower pace. His upper body is continuing to move in sort of a free motion above him, which perhaps is using quite a bit of energy in addition to the feet, which might be why he's losing stamina. He might want to tighten up that upper body and be more clear and direct in his movements. For all the performance so far, the dancer has been performing pretty much the same footwork the entire duration of the performance. He's performing a step touch side to side with his feet and has a little bit of motion happening here in the pelvis, which is coming down through the knee as well. And arm swings that have gotten progressively bigger over the duration of this performance. Overall, though, his movements feel really disjointed and repetitive. He's got quite a lot of stiffness in his spine, in his shoulders, and up through his neck and head, which is creating an awkwardness in his movements and keeping him from connecting to the rhythm and also demonstrating technical skill. As the dancer is beginning this performance, he's struggling to stay connected to the movement in a pretty significant way. While he's moving side to side in a tempo that aligns with the music that he's dancing with, his movements don't quite make sense. He's got this accented footwork happening, a step touch underneath him. With his arms just gently swaying to side to side on top of him, overall he could use some clarity in his movements and to lose some stiffness in his spine. As the dancer continues to perform the series of step touches side to side with this sort of loose upper body and arms, he is able to catch the rhythm with his feet and able to embody the connection to the music down in his feet. However, as we move up through his body, he loses that connection with the music as his movements are too loose and don't really have any specific dynamic qualities to them, which is why he's finding it hard to embody the rhythm here. As the dancer is performing this set of movements, he's really losing track of the technique and of the rhythm of the music. It's hard to identify precisely what genre of dance he is supposed to be performing. His head is really loosely kind of hanging on top of his spine here and is really disconnected from the movement of his body as well as the rhythm of the music. His arms could benefit from some more clarity in their shaping. They're just kind of hanging off the sides of his shoulders and his feet could benefit from some clarity in the movement as well, but also a deeper bend in the knees bringing him more grounded to the floor and more in control of his movement.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He's doing a good job of keeping it in a straight position But that with his left arm He is being forced to have to pull and engage it Because without keeping the arm engaged Here the rest of his body would come out away from the wall possibly leading to a fall But because he's able to hang on to that handhold. He's He is doing a good job of keeping his body controlled as much as possible to try and regain a foot position So here we can see that the climber is trying his best to keep his core nice and straight So he's not allowing his back to bend backwards and then on top of that by bringing his knee up into this position here It further increases the tension he can have with his core and gives him a better opportunity of bringing his feet back on the wall So even though he did allow his feet to come off the wall This is a good demonstration of how to keep himself in a controlled state So then that way he can bring his feet back on the wall and continue climbing And so here we can see that as the climber was able to match his hands on this handhold here He was after at that point immediately able to go over into this next left handhold And what I'm noticing with this climber is he's kind of naturally moving through the flow of this movement Which can be a good thing But sometimes can also make it where he's using up a lot a little bit more energy Just because as he's naturally flowing through this movement He's kind of swinging his body from side to side in the direction that he needs to Which is a good thing But it does kind of force his hands to have to engage a little bit harder onto his handholds in order to kind of Compensate or hang on to the swinging motion that he's doing So this does make it a little bit harder over time if he's going to be climbing on harder climbs just because In this current climb he is able to hang on to jugs which are really good holds Um, so that's probably why this climbers comfortable with doing that But what I'm noticing is that he is getting a little bit of Rotation so that the left side of his body is getting closer to the wall to help out with this movement Um, but then with his right flagging foot we can kind of see it's in a bent position here Um, so this flagging foot kind of shows to me that he's not having full control of what's going on with every extremity in his body Which can be important because with this flagging foot in this position It actually helps to pull some of his body weight away from the wall So it's making it a little bit harder again for his hands to have to engage and hang on to this handholds So it's just something I would recommend to the climbers possibly just slowing down a little bit On his movement so that he can be a little bit more coordinated and understanding his balance So he's not having to compensate by squeezing harder with his hands And so here we can see that after the clamor was able to get both hands together on this handhold here He's now hanging on with the left hand there in order to get his right hand over into the final handhold So again, we can kind of see where he's been continually swinging from one side and over to the other And that's mainly just to kind of get a good understanding of which hand to be placing onto the next handhold I'm so here in this current move We can kind of see that he's allowing his body to swing over to the right And one of the ways he's able to do that is by swinging his left flagging foot out and to the left Because by swinging it out in that direction It does actually kind of help to place a lot of his body weight over that right foot and swing the rest of his body Over to the right. I'm into the final handhold. Um, so this is kind of a way to Complete a boulder if the climber is capable of doing it. I would never really Recommended too much for most climbers just because as you get into more difficult climbs or difficult handholds Climbing in this manner becomes very difficult because it makes it very hard to actually engage the handhold So the climbers really only able to do this just because he's utilizing big holds which we call jugs so again, I would recommend a little bit more static approach as to Completing a boulder even if the climbers climbing on a easier climb for their difficulty So here we can see the Clamor was able to originally bring his right hand from the starting handhold to be in a matched position on this holder here and then he immediately brought his right hand up into the next handhold here. So in this position we can see that he was using a left hand on the starting handhold here however we don't see any of the feet that he was utilizing but what we can notice is as soon as he grabbed onto this next right hand he did allow his both of his feet to come out and away from the wall so at this point he has been forced to hang entirely on his arms to basically recompose himself and get his feet back on the wall. So this does make it where he's using up a lot of energy on his upper body because he's hanging entirely on his arms so I would always encourage Clamors to at least try and make sure they have at least one foot making contact with the wall so then that way they can help reduce this from happening because this does use up a lot of energy very quickly. And so here we can see the Clamor was able to move his right hand up into this next handhold here So really the Clamor was able to do this movement Just because he is kind of demonstrating a little bit of body weight transfer over that right foot But I think the main thing that's doing it for him is being able to go in this lock off position with his left arm Here, so as he's locking off, which is a 90 degree angle with his left arm in this position He's able to kind of pull his upper body over in the direction that he needs to in order to reach over to this left Handhold so that could just be something this Clamor is comfortable doing But it does also seem like he's using a little bit of momentum kind of similar to his earlier moves Where he's just kind of allowing his body to swing into the next position And so here we can see just a quick little instance that the climber is kind of getting himself ready for the next move Where he's adjusting his hands and he's adjusting his feet making sure he's in the optimal position that he wants to go to In order to move his hand up into this next handhold here But what I'm noticing is that as the climber is getting himself ready He is allowing himself to kind of pull and engage with his arms And so by doing this as he's kind of preparing for this Move this does use up a little bit more energy on his upper body by being in this flex position So what I would always recommend the climbers is as they're working up into the next position Kind of adjusting their hands and feet wherever they need to go Just trying to make sure that they're being in a straight arm position as much as possible And then this helps to conserve the energy on their arms as The energy in our arms can run out very quickly and once that happens, it usually makes it very impossible or difficult In order to complete a boulder. So that's just something I would recommend for this climber And so here we can see the climber was able to move his left hand up into this next handhold here So in this position he is hanging on with a right hand in this position right here Then he is utilizing a left foot behind his body here as well as a right foot Um, so what the climber is trying to do here is with the right foot He's ultimately trying to push his body weight over to the left So then that way he can place a lot of his body weight onto that left foot and then with his left foot he is Rotating his knees so that his knee is pointed to the right And the main reason for that is that he can allow his Left side of his hip to be closer to the wall Which makes that left hand reach a little bit easier to do And then on top of this this does allow him to kind of place a lot of his body weight Onto that left foot so that when he's ready you can kind of push it with it and direct the rest of his body Body weight upwards into the left hand hole that he's going for I'm the only thing I'm also noticing though is the climber is incorporating a lot of pulling while he's doing this move So it's going to show him that he has a slight preference in his upper body abilities To be able to complete a lot of these movements", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And that's happening because the guitarist has decreased the size and the speed of the motion of his picking. So he should keep that pretty much the same, if not slightly larger, slightly faster motion, because the notes that high in the guitar are naturally gonna be a little bit quieter. We have a big loss of tone and volume on the high strings the guitarist is playing right now. This is caused by the knuckle on his second finger of his left hand collapsing. So the strings aren't being held down all the way, which means they're not going to vibrate as much as they could, and they're not going to make as much sound. So ideally he would still keep a rounded shape to his fingers so that we can hear those notes as clear as all the others. On each of these strums, we're hearing the lower notes of the chord more than the higher notes. So the guitarist just needs to make sure that his motion is fluid all the way until those higher strings. The motion starts to come off the string and slow down a little bit at the end of the motion, which means those higher strings that come after the low strings get less power, get less volume. So ideally we'd want to hear all these notes equally. What we are hearing is some notes of the arpeggio are louder than the others. Some are hardly audible. This is because the guitarist is choosing to do a sweep picking technique where he does all down strokes on some notes and then throws in the occasional upstroke. This isn't what we want to do because in the arpeggio we want to hear every note clearly and relatively the same volume. So the correct thing to do here would be to do an alternating up and down stroke instead of a sweep picking technique. In terms of body position, we would like to see both of his heels flat on the floor. We see that the left foot is crossed over the right. This is just going to add instability to the body, and any kind of shift in weight in the body is going to affect the clarity of the left hand. So ideally, both feet flat on the floor and sitting up a little bit straighter. Ideally, what we would want to hear here is a crescendo to the top of the scale and a decrescendo to the end. While it is good to keep the notes uniform, we want to add a gesture in here so that no matter what we're doing, there is musical expression behind it. So the correct gesture is crescendo to the top, decrescendo to the bottom. The guitarist is playing this arpeggio faster than he is able to get his left hand to the appropriate notes So he needs to start this slower so he has time to reach those notes and then practice it Gradually up to speed until he's able to play this tempo with every note speaking Throughout this whole arpeggio, we're hearing slide after slide in every shift. So the guitarist needs to either shift faster and not pluck before he's already reached the note, or pick a fingering that goes across the strings instead of up the strings so that the shifts are fewer. This will allow it to sound just a clear note-to-note, no-slide scale. What we heard was a slide in the shift in the scale. We don't want to do any slide when we are playing scales, especially because it's not written in the music here. So that shift has to happen. If it's from one finger to the same finger, has to happen quickly in between pick strokes. And we can't pick the next note until our finger has already reached the note. What we hear is an excellent example of uniformity of dynamic and uniformity of articulation. What that creates is a very smooth sounding scale. The guitarist is doing this by making sure his left hand is already on the fret that he needs to play by the time he plucks it and by keeping his picking motion very small and very concise and having just a repeated motion of up and down. So this is exactly what we want to hear and this is exactly how to achieve it. This is a really great example of great tone on an electric guitar. The tendency with electric guitar is to pluck too hard and then we get a buzzing or snapping to our tone. The guitarist is using a really sensitive and light touch with the right hand and with the pick, which is why we get just beautiful, round, clear tone out of the guitar. So this is exactly what we want to hear. We're missing the sound of a lot of notes of this arpeggio, and that is because the left hand and the right hand aren't in sync. So what the guitarist should do is make sure the left hand has reached the fret before he plucks it so that we can hear every note of this arpeggio. What we're hearing is a break in the rhythm every time the guitarist shifts. We also hear that the note preceding the shift is shorter. The only way to improve this is just to practice it slowly and to shift faster. We have to hold on to that note before the shift for as long as we hold on to every other note and just have to make a quick and accurate shift to the next note so that the listener isn't aware that we are shifting. This is a really great example of finger usage on the left hand. We see a great curve to all these fingers and the position in a way where only the fingertip is touching the string and that's giving a great clear sound. And also we see that even though right now he's playing with his first finger, the other fingers are not far from the string. This is what allows him to play with such clarity at really any speed. The closer we keep our fingers to the string, the less distance we have to travel to get back there. So that's what's allowing him to play this so smoothly. We hear that the top note of this scale, played with the fourth finger in the left hand, is louder than the other notes and also has a harsher articulation. This is because on that stroke, the guitarist plucked a little bit too much up with a little bit too much force. What I mean by up is not horizontal across the guitar, but outwards. And so ideally, we would want that note to sound exactly the same as the ones that come before it. So just keep repeating that same exact motion that you used on the preceding notes.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I would encourage the dancer to have a little bit more precision here. They can do that by grounding as well as engaging that torso so they're ready to do these quick movements that will follow. I would encourage the dancer to have more follow-through in their arms. So don't just stop halfway through the movement, but to really have this circular pattern, no matter which way they're circling their arms to finish the movement before they go to the next. So working on those transitions would take it to the next level for proficiency of advanced choreography. I would encourage the dancer to be more playful at the beginning of the step as they're kind of doing these step touches before they go into this really fast step so they're prepared to go. But also because they've already started moving, it looks like it's a part of the choreography. So being intentional about how you're preparing for that becomes a part of the choreography or a pre-choreography. So that's really important to execute that well too. So if you're going to do a bouncing step to start, your head should be lifted, your chest should be lifted so you can be ready to go. Here for this movement where their arms go kind of up and then their hips go back, I would encourage them to ground themselves so they can move their hips forward and back in this pendulum swing and create an even greater dynamic quality. I would encourage the dancer to clean the movements. And when I say clean the movements, what I mean by that is be very precise about body placement. And so it doesn't look like they're kind of just moving to move. It looks like they're hitting choreography and striking the choreography exactly where they need to be. I would encourage a dancer to have more hip articulation here to increase the overall embodiment and dynamic quality of the movement.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

As he catches the ball out of the net, after making the layup, he allows the ball to drop down to his waist area. When we're doing a mic-in drill, we want to make sure when we catch the ball, the ball stays high near our upper chest or neck area and never allowing the ball to drop down to our waist. The player here shows the proper footwork for doing the Mike and drill when we're doing the Mike and drill off of one foot and we're shooting on the right side of the basket with our right hand. He makes sure that he jumps off of his right foot in order to shoot the ball with his right hand on the right side of the basket. As we're jumping, you see the plate his knee is well below the level of his waist. Ideally when we're doing the Mike and drill as we're going up with our right hand we want to lift this knee up to our waist area so that will help us to jump to the highest of our capabilities which will then allow us to release the ball at a higher, higher in the air and at the maximum capacity of our jump. So you see as the ball is down here if he maximizes his jump instead of releasing the ball here he will release the ball even a little bit higher and the higher we release the ball the greater chance that we have of getting the shot over the defense without the defense blocking or contesting the shot. we take a look at the placement of the ball it is inside the top portion of the square excuse me, it's inside the left portion of the square and it's slightly above the top portion of the square you can see from this view that it hit the backboard above the top portion of the square with the placement of the ball in this position, since it's inside the square we have to be careful with the amount of side spin that we put on the ball if he was to place this ball out at this height but outside the square here it would spin off the backboard and go in to the basket without any problems but since it's inside the square we have to be careful with the amount of side spin that we put on the ball because if we put too much on the ball it's going to spin off the backboard and go off of the right side of the rim and we miss it that way or it spins off the backboard and catches the inside of the right portion of the rim and then we get that toilet bowl effect where it spins around the rim and now it's a 50-50 proposition as to whether it's going to spin around and go out of the basket or it's going to spin around and go into the basket. In this case, on this shot attempt it spin around and we end up missing the shot As the player makes the layup, he catches the ball out of the net and he steps. He does the correct footwork by making sure he steps with his right foot to the left side of the basket. Then he's going to jump off of his left foot and extend the ball out with his left hand and shoot the layup on the left side of the basket with his left hand.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

To generate power the climber then presses the thumb onto the one side to squeeze onto the hold and once the climber secures the grip then he would be able to lean back.

This one was placed on a large hold and when doing the transition the climber did not give sufficient pressure into the hold, which is the reason why the climber has come out of the foot placement and now it's on the mat ending the climb. The climber is chucking up his hands, the reason why he is placing his hands inside of the chuck bucket. He will be covering over his palms and that will help him with having better grip when sustaining onto the holds of the wall as well as absorbing any sweat that may be coming from his hands. The climbers is starting at a one-hold start, both of the hands placed into the same hole. This is called matching and he places with both hands as a pinch grip. This is because the climber is placing the fingers above and the thumb at the bottom. Placing the thumb onto the other side helps the climber to generate more power onto the grip and once a climber gets to secure the grip placement he will be able to then lean back to apply weight to the grips.

He should have been traveling towards his right, but the movement is very stagnant and mostly in place. However, the dancer is looking towards his partner's direction because his partner is leading and he can't really anticipate what his partner is doing. So if that is the case, then the dancer really should be looking at his partner directly so that is purposeful instead of trying to view him as he is right here at the corner of his eyes. The dancer is looking off towards the low diagonal of the room. He sees a lot of the floor at his view and that should not be the case. The dancers don't really have a good spatial awareness with each other right here. When the dancing black turns in, he turns in too close to his partner. There should be some further distance between them. The dancer is leaning too forward here with his spine. It's not entirely his fault because his partner's arm should also be straightened and at a shoulder level so that he could also be pulling backwards. And if they were both pulling backwards, then the dancer in the black wouldn't have to lean forward as he is. The dancer does a good job of pulling a backwards in opposition away from his partners so that their partnership spans a large amount of space. The dancer is taking a very small steps here instead he should be taking larger steps on moving further forward and further backward. The dancer's triple steps aren't very clear. It should be three steps in a row. So if he's using his left foot forward first, it should be left foot, right foot, left foot. Or if he uses his right foot forward, it would be the opposite, right, left, right. But it should be three distinct steps and that isn't really clear in his footwork. The dancer should either be looking straight forward or at his partner completely to make connection. However, the dancer also has to move to the same extent or using the same amount of space as his partner does, since they're connected here by the arm.

So you can have this kind of jumping buoyancy to be able to kick and step and kick and step. Everything is kind of light like the floor is lava. So really having that buoyancy from the soles of the foot all the way to the crown of the head. It appears that the dancer is like half a second off at this moment for the rock a step a triple step a rock a step a triple step. So to improve the speed in which they're doing it, I would encourage them to once again plie or bend their knees and to send that those hips back to create a greater access to move on and create a greater range of motion. Also when they're stepping, right, when they put that whole foot on the ground to really shift that hip towards that leg so they can lean into that movement and shift their weight to be able to power forward on one leg or power forward on the other and really drive across the floor so they can stay on the beat. This is another great example of where the dancer has this opportunity to plie and then send those hips back, but also use this leg to lean into whatever direction they're going. So if they're leaning, their whole hip should turn and lean into that leg to be able to drive the direction that they want to go. This way they can really power across the floor. I would encourage this dancer to do a little bit more practicing of the musicality and embodiment of the rhythm. This would encourage precision, but it will also improve the overall look and quality of the dance. I would encourage the dancer again to think about musicality, to think about when to plie or bend their legs versus when to be lifted, using those arms as an anchor and also spotting that head. So looking one direction and then whipping that head around quickly and having the rest of the body follow would improve the overall look and feel. I know I just named several things, but when you do them all together and figure out each piece of that puzzle, it really creates so much more efficiency. And it's like patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time. Once you learn how to do it and you do it in sync, it's a skill that is hard to unlearn, right? So again, encouraging the dancer to work on these separate skills and then thinking about how they can all work together to create this proficiency of movement. If the dancer is going to use their arms, I would highly encourage them to use their arms as an anchor or to help them with the direction, so making sure they have power and precision beyond the arm so it can tell the rest of the body which way to move. The dancer is showing a great effort of having the rhythm in their body, but the rhythm is not matching the music. And the trick is to have both match while making it look effortless. So I would encourage the dancer to do some work on this to improve the overall dynamic quality, efficiency, and precision of the movement.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

As the dancer performs some basic salsa choreography with her feet, she has a lot of clarity in her feet and lower body, and is windmilling her shoulders above her head in a circular motion, which demonstrates that she's able to perform both the role of the lower body as well as the arm choreography with a lot of precision and clarity, and she stays deeply connected to the rhythm through this as well. As the dancer begins to some basic salsa movement, right away she appears very familiar and at a more advanced level with this movement vocabulary and technique. She's got a lot of precision and clarity happening in her arms as well as attention to movement dynamics, and similarly in her feet. She has a nice soft bend in her knees which is helping to keep her grounded, and overall might just benefit from dropping her pelvis back more to achieve a more deeper grounding. As the dancer transitions from performing this full body undulation into this salsa movement, this is a really solid transition. She's able to transition from one step to the next with a lot of clarity, particularly in her footwork, as well as a nice transition of her arms that's clear and appropriate for the movement. As the dancer performs this circular undulation of the shoulders and pelvis she's got a really nice range of motion here. However, she cuts her movement short to transition into the next movement, ultimately kind of lacking precision through this transition. If she were to perhaps get an additional rehearsal to really work out this transition and become more familiar with the choreography that would be beneficial.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So kudos to them for their energy, but I definitely think that there is room for some growth. Again, I would encourage the dancers to look at each other more and to really have a strong frame throughout. I would encourage the dancers to think about when they're connected, that one arm that is free, what is that arm supposed to be doing and what shapes does it make so it can look a lot cleaner. This is a good example of when you're more grounded, how you can really use that undercurve to press through space and to be able to twirl and really whip it. This dancer is doing a really lovely job of demonstrating that. This is a moment where I think there's a lot of work that needs to be done of really truly understanding what the rhythm is and then embodying that rhythm fully. So to make sure that they're on beat the entire time. Here I will repeat some of my previous comments about precision, especially of the arms. I would also include when they're kicking, any moments that they're kicking, making sure that they're very precise with the legs and should the foot be pointed or flexed. All of these little details will improve the overall proficiency of this basic technique. Here I would encourage the dancers to make sure that they're taking bigger steps and that they're looking at each other to be more engaged. Also notice how their frame isn't so strong because their elbow is pointed towards the ground and this arm here is not lifted so it's hard for them to communicate through body language of where to go next because they have that kind of broken, really introverted frame. The dancers are doing a good job of trying to maintain musicality. I would encourage them to have even more energy and panache in order to stay on the rhythm and over anticipate the rhythm and always look energetic. I would encourage dancers again to be more grounded so they can use that pendulum swing of those hips back and forth forward to really power through and press through space and really create this really swinging vibe that they're going for. They're doing a really good job or have a really solid base of how to push and pull each other to tell each other where to go. I definitely think that there's room for improvement and growth. This dancer right here is doing a really good job. Notice how they're more grounded. I would encourage this dancer to work on their groundedness as well so they can both fly together in space.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

In this position we can see that the climber was hanging on with their right hand and they did utilize a left foot kind of in this higher position here. So because they're using opposite points of contact with each other, this does actually allow the climber to really rotate and pivot her body accordingly. So we can see that the climber is able to rotate their body so that the left side of the body gets closer to the wall, which does help with this left hand movement. And then one very important thing is what she's doing with her right foot. So we can see that it's flagging out into the right right here. So that's really helping to control her movements so that she can rotate in the direction that she needs to. And it's really good to see that the climber is having really good control of that flagging foot by keeping it in a static position up against the wall from the beginning of the move all the way to the end of the move. So that shows that the climber is really focusing on what's going on with their footwork in this climb here. So here we can see that the climber has brought in her right foot, so it's now in this position here. It's kind of hard to say exactly where her left foot is, but it might be flagging up against the wall in a small way. But one thing I keep on noticing though is that the climber is allowing herself to kind of swing back and forth from left to right, and one of the main reasons I think that is the case is because we can see that both of her hands are stacked on top of each other, and that she is also deciding to place both her feet in a very narrow position, kind of close to that position as well. So this does allow the climber to be able to rotate back and forth around those points. So this kind of shows that the climber is not really getting full control of what's going on with their body weight here. So I would definitely encourage the climber to really focus on flagging that left foot around the corner of the wall, so then that way she can get more control of her body, and it's no longer swinging from left to right, and this will allow her to kind of move into the next movement that she needs to do.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

It's super strong moment here for her Great musicality, the music, and she hits this right on that lyric. Really strong shape, nice straight elbows, great energy at the fingertips. She hits the shape and holds it for just long enough for it to read as a shape, which is excellent. So this is the third movement here in a series where she's got her weight or where she's got her plie here and she's kind of doing this gentle bounce with her legs, which the lower legs look great. Her arms are pretty strong too. She's doing kind of three different shapes with the arms and this is the third shape. The issue is that she's doing some some disjointed sorts of movements with the torso. It's not consistent each time and it doesn't quite coordinate very well with the bounce or with the way her arms are moving. So it just looks a little bit uncoordinated and imprecise. So I'd recommend she get a little bit more clear about what's meant to happen here and do and execute it more strongly. I love that she's starting this movement, this sort of upper body neck roll, by going very far to one side and allowing her head to also get off balance. That helps to exaggerate this movement. Another thing that's helping is that as she's doing that bend with her torso and her neck, she's also got her weight more on that foot, so that helps to accentuate and exaggerate the movement even more. So I don't really know what's happening here and I'm not gonna fault the dancer for this It seems like someone from the side Maybe her instructor is trying to tell her something and so she's getting a little distracted But what I do want to say is that even though she's distracted She's doing a really good job of staying on the right on the beat. She's doing the basic salsa step She's staying with it, even though someone's talking to her. I mean typically I would say ignore Anything from the outside So maybe I'm giving being too lenient on her that she didn't just ignore what someone was saying to her, but regardless She's sticking with this basic step and in addition to doing the one two three with the feet She's also got the nice sway of the hips that we typically see with this basic step So she's got a great great foundation and as a great great mover She's kind of stepping forward here. I love that as she's doing this transition step, she's keeping her arms really strong. This one looks really strong, just placed here on her chest, which allows this arm to really shine. She's making a really nice arc back and around with energy out her fingertips, so it looks really great. This is the second time she's doing a kick. The first time she went to her right and this time to her left. Unfortunately, this is not consistent with the other side. It's not as strong as the other side. She doesn't quite hit it as quickly as sharply here. She also has fully turned her pelvis and torso in this direction. So the kick loses that nice counterbalance that it had on the other side when her pelvis and torso were facing downstage. She doesn't do the same arms she did before and these arms are not as strong. Previously, she had the opposite arm in front of her body and this one out with really nice energy out her fingertips. So I'd love to see her stay consistent between the two sides, especially because the first time was so strong. If she could recreate that on this side, it would be really just that much better. Great job dancing through this transition. She brought her right arm up just next to her face and then as it came down she brought the left arm up over her face as she's continuing to move her feet and her pelvis side to side. Really beautiful moment here. She's using a lot of grace and keeping the energy really alive throughout her whole body. This is a really successful step for her and It's because of the attack and what is helping her Make this attack happen is that what you can see is in this moment what she's done is transferred her weight to her left foot nice deep plie and is Transferring her weight back to her right foot very quickly So it gives this the movement this really boom boom sort of shape that's really unexpected. I should say pathway That's really unexpected and she does it right with the beat. So it looks really really strong Also, she brings this arm out very quickly with a nice straight elbow and again energy out the fingertips So it helps to accentuate that shape. She's making with her lower half Really strong shape here. She's stepped through, she pushed through the ball of this foot to get her weight onto this foot, which helps this moment be really successful and strong. She's also attacking with the arms, nice straight shoulder, straight elbows, energy out the fingertips, really nice graceful shape here. She hits the shape and holds it just long enough for it to read as a shape, but not long, so long that she's not with the music anymore. She's also really enjoying herself and expressing something with her face, which is really helpful for connecting her to her audience. It gets a little bit kind of monotone here. Again, the shapes are not quite exaggerated enough to vary to really read. This is a good interesting choice. She's leapt from the right foot to the left as she's turning, which could make for a really nice dynamic turn. The arms are a little chicken wingy, they're not super strong here, so it detracts from the turn itself. Here she's already started a turn before really prepping for it very well and the arm is quite tense here It doesn't quite work for this turn It looks like she's gonna do this incorrect turn technique that I see a lot Where she's gonna have me turning around to the hip rather than the ball of the foot You can see she's kind of planted this foot Which tells me that she's probably gonna rotate the rest of her body around her hip joint rather than the ball of the foot which Is more correct turn technique A little bit of an awkward transition moment, just kind of not a lot of energy through her body here. So again, continuing to dance through the whole piece and through every step. This is a great transition moment so she's here preparing for something but it doesn't look like she's preparing for something because as she's stepping onto this foot, first of all there's a lot of energy and dynamism coming through the feet and the lower half of the body, but also she's doing these sorts of flicks or rotations with her wrists as she comes through which helps to add a little bit of interest to this transition moment. This a little bit awkward moment it kind of seems like maybe she didn't know exactly what she was supposed to do here. She kind of hits this shape once and then again and flips her wrist so it just looks a little bit unclear what's meant to happen and so it doesn't quite read very well. So I'd have I'd like to encourage her to figure out what the choreographer meant by this section and get really much more clear about it. Great start to this choreography. She's done a really strong kick right on the beat nice flick to it good energy Also great energy with the arms and hands energy coming out the fingertips really hits that really strongly Also, she's doing something with her face. She's a she's exhibiting An emotion she's kind of going. Oh look at this cool thing. I'm doing really great start to this choreography I like that she almost fully completes that circle with her head before she drops this shape. These little steps here are looking really nice. She's on the balls of both feet which really helps her to take small quick steps as she's bringing her foot across. My only critique is I would say actually take smaller steps and cross over a little bit more maybe here rather than here with this foot. That would just make the step look that much more precise and interesting and would also encourage more rotation through the pelvis which would add a layer of interest to the step. This turn here is a little bit weak. She needed a little bit of a stronger leap from the right to the left foot. She just kind of more stepped into it. She didn't really give it a nice big leap. And this type of turn where you're leaping and turning at the same time is more effective if the leap can be pretty high so that you can get a nice air as you're bringing the foot around. At this point in the turn, I would actually expect her to still be in the air and not have landed yet. And that's partly why this looks a little bit stiff and not so well executed. This is a great moment. She's very clear about where she's placing her foot and when. She hits it exactly on the right moment of the beat. She's doing a nice twist with the arms and the neck here. It looks really, really strong. And it's because she's very clear, okay, this is exactly where my toe is going at this moment. Here she's done a little bit of a windmill with her arms, but you can see that her elbow is pretty bent, so it doesn't really make it look like a good windmill shape. And so this moment is just a little bit too small here. She needed to exaggerate this more, be a bit more clear and precise about what she's doing to make it really read well. This is a really nice transition moment here. She's kind of bringing her weight up and back with her arm coming arms coming up and back in this twist and it looks really strong. She's kind of lost the attack that she had at the beginning of the piece here. It kind of looks like maybe she's improvising at this point or maybe forgot exactly what was supposed to happen because she's not putting that same oomph and energy from her core outwards that she had at the beginning. So finding a way to continue keeping the energy up high and keep those textures really interesting with different ways of attacking. Great job here with these movements. She's turning the hips in one direction and then the other. What makes this successful? She's right on the music and that's because she's on the balls of her feet. So she's using this small pivot point to help her rotate as she's turning the hips in and out. The arms are doing sort of opposite motion here. It looks really strong.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He is plucking with his fingertips and not so much his fingernails, but he's using it with the right amount of weight and pressure so that each note rings out pretty clearly with the help of the amplification system. This is the correct chord shape for the note that he's trying to play there. Earlier he had a different chord shape, so there were incorrect notes that were sounding. If he moved his leg over here and sat a little bit taller, I think it would be easier for him to navigate the fingerboard and play the guitar a little bit more efficiently. He's doing this finger pattern accurately, so he's kind of alternating between thumb, middle finger, pointer finger, and then the ring finger, and then the ring finger plays about four notes in a row. And so he's doing this finger pattern slowly, but he is doing it accurately. As he's reading these notes, he's changing between chords a little bit slowly, so it might be possible that he's seeing this music for the first time, and he's really focusing more on just making sure he's playing the correct notes, but not really on a very coherent musical expressive phrase.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He's gathering all the ingredients and utensils that he needs to make his omelet. The genomics allow the egg to cook instead of constantly moving it.

So a slight bend in the knee will help with this movement that is about to happen. The dancer is doing a lot of complex steps here. They step over, they reach to the side, they do a body roll. I think to create more fluidity and also have range of motion in this, to have more precision, because having more range of motions allows you with a bigger base to create that precision, they would have to plie even more, bend their knees and stick their bum out a bit to create this arc that they have, can move through.

She has a lot of energy, he doesn't have much energy. It's important in a partnership for them to be paired and on the same vibe, like on the same level. She is outperforming him. So the extent in which she's performing is good. However, in terms of her being part of a partnership, it's not so good. Because they shouldn't be looking at it so much as two soloists. They should be looking like one duet or one partnership of two people. So even though they're disconnected physically, meaning they're not holding hands, they still should look as if they're dancing in the same realm, in the same world. And it doesn't very much still look like that. Also, she is kind of turning herself here and is not necessarily taking his lead, which is why they lose hand contact because she is just spinning herself. And instead of spinning herself, she needs to allow him to be spinning her. He is leading her, and so her arms should only move as a result of him moving her arms. The dancer is not on timing with the music. She is a bit behind and slow, but also she has to take the timing off of the male in the black that's leading. So as long as he's leading off timing, she will continue to be off timing. Um, they're just not operating in their designated roles of leader and follower. She's doing well and showing a variety of steps, but the dancer in the black dress said he is mimicking her as the leader he should be leading and she should be more so mimicking him. So there's just a disconnect here. It's hard to evaluate the dancer in the pink as a follower because she is dancing more as a leader. And it's just hard to evaluate them individually when they are a partnership. She is dancing with a lot of energy. When she's moving around she's using creativity, bringing her arms up and down, spinning around. So in this freestyle she is alternating directions. She's also alternating levels of her limbs and arms. So that aspect in terms of creativity is good. She is dancing on flat feet. Her whole foot is on the ground. She should be dancing on her toes with her heels lifted off the ground so that all of these directional changes, forward and backwards, right and left, for her, could be done more easily. Um the I'll be commenting on the dancer wearing all pink because she's the one that's wearing the goggles. Um her Rib cage and upper body is very loose So as she's doing these a step touches horizontally to her right and her left her upper body from her neck to her Hips is swaying quite a lot and also a rotating wall rotating backwards and forwards, um Rotating both directions as she is stepping sideways and it's um too much movement and takes away from the actual footwork Again, this is another situation where she just starts spinning herself and it's not really taking the lead from him, but I will say he is not being very clear and adamant. He needs to be strong in his arms to lead her, and so she is not getting that proper lead. The dancers let go of hand contact. They should be in hand contact the entire time. So when she is turning, she should still be holding his hand. The dancer in the pink is mimicking or sorry is mirroring the dancer in the black who is the leader She's following him. So When he is using his left foot To travel towards the chairs. She's traveling in that same direction but instead Using her left foot. She's using her right foot. So they're both using the side of the body that is facing each other and so they're Partnering as if they're looking in a mirror so she is following his movements exactly here. So that's good", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Nice high release here with the elbow tucked in. More evidence on the left side. He knew the right hand doing the work and the left hand supporting. This is all good. One thing though, he jumps back on his shot, which is interesting. Right now, I'd say he's at like a six. Good job on the follow through with the wrist flick with the right hand.

I would encourage the dancer to take bigger steps here and really be overly dramatic, especially with that beginning step of sliding the feet off of the floor to make that really intentional.

We still want to find a way to make sure the pelvis is, can move around and can have some mobility and flexibility there. It took the dancers a moment to get into the same rhythm or the same counts and steps, but they eventually did. And once they did, they were saying things out loud to each other so that they can hear one another and just be aware of the movement. It would also be nice if the movement can move a little faster and if the dancers were not focused so much downward, but really up and out and were a little bit more confident in the steps and the movement, where they could just enjoy it a little bit more as well and just pick up the pace a bit. Those turns were good. I think if the music were also louder and they were more in tune with the music, it would help them while not so much being, you know, on top of this, the counts per se, because a lot of this movement was done improvisationally, historically, and people were doing swing dancing and they were doing the Lindy Hop and all types of movements where the dancers just watched each other and the lead was leading and the steps were not choreographed beforehand. And so that's always something to note there, that so you wanna know the music and rely on that versus so much on the counts with the steps.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He then looks down, being extended at the feet, and needs to be purposeful the way that he switches his feet. So he brings the right foot to meet where the left foot is, and once he applies pressure with the right toe on the hold, then the climber will be able to release the left foot to the next stance. Here, in order for the climber to recover out of the swing, he must hold on to the grips tight and tense the body to not allow the swing to go completely out, peeling him off the wall. So, the climber must engage the core and this will be transferred down to the legs so that the climber is able to pick up the legs and make a foot placement as soon as he gains momentum on the swing back. The climber has brought the left foot down and it's important that the climber glances over to make an accurate placement of the feet. This one because the left foot is going to be taking place instead of the right foot. As we can see the climber is pulling on the grips to release some pressure down at the feet while making the switch. It's important that the climber is still activating some sort of pressure down at the feet as if he doesn't apply any pressure it will make the climber swing out of the wall. So as the climber is making the switch we can see how the left toe is being placed above the right toe. And this so that the climber in the moment he hops over the right foot can take place above the hold while releasing the right foot out of the placement. Here the climber was able to generate power on the pole to make the reach up to the next hold. As we can see the hold that the right hand is sustaining is a jug, so this seems as a positive hold and a promising hold too. The climber secured the grip once placing the hand. The left foot wasn't used in this instance to generate power on the stance, it just was helpful for the climber to keep himself still on the wall without cutting feet. As the climber had made the reach up to the pinch, this one placing the fingers on the outside and the thumb on the inside, this will make the climber generate power by squeezing on that hold, which is mostly generated with a lot of pressure with the thumb being on the opposite side where the fingers are placed. Now the climber must create pressure not only by squeezing the hold but also leaning onto the hold to create friction and maintain that stance. As the climber was going up for the reach, we can see how his right side is towards the wall and this will help the climber when obtaining the reach as he had made the stance on the right foot to gain height. Also it's important that the climber had kept the right side towards the wall, which he has made on the forceful pull up. Here the climber has made the move of the left hand up to the next hold. Now the climber is sending the right leg extended. This is called flagging out which helps the climber to shift the weight over to be placed on the foot placed down below as he made the stance. The flagging out helps the climber to keep balance when going out for the reach as he shifted the weight over to the foot supporting him when making the stance. Here the climber quickly after resting the arm he made a pull up move to release the left foot that was a distance and made the move up to the next hold, the right hand grip. As soon as that one was positioned we can see how the jug is so secured that the climber is able to hold it down below to pull himself into the wall as he was making the stance on the right foot. Now the climber has brought the left foot into placement and is glancing over to what the next move may be as he would need to bring his left hand at a higher stance. Since this is a rest position, the climber has sent his right hand down and is shaking it. This is to release any tension that the climber potentially has built up to this point. As soon as the climber is ready resting that arm, he will then place it back onto the hold. Here the climber is starting at a two hand hold start. The right hand being placed on a sloper, this means that the climber must maintain pressure by creating friction between the fingertips and creating weight by him leaning underneath the hold. Now the left hand is placed on a jug where the climber is able to curl the fingers behind it and pull the hold out in order to keep pressure. As we can see the climber has made a foot placement, right foot down on the foot chip and the left foot much elevated where he places the middle of the foot, outer edge, towards the hold. Now that the climber is off the mat then the climb has started. The climber here has sent the right hand to match at the last hold. Once the climber has sustained the hand placement for three seconds, then the climber has completed the problem. In order for the climber to make it to the last hold, the climber had engaged into a forceful pull up from his last hand placement, the left hand going again for another move up the sequence. He was able to place the hand above the hold and the fingers to slide behind the lip of that hold. This is called a jug, so the climber is able to sustain that positive grip and curls the fingers in order to engage the grip and pulling onto the hold. Now because the climber has now shifted the weight to the highest placed hand, we can see how the climber has lost touch of the right foot placement with the hold and is out on the swing. In order for the climber to sustain his swing, he must press down on the foot, that's the left foot. But in this case, if the climber's right foot is swinging, the left foot might come out of the swing as well, so the climber must apply tight grip in order to sustain cutting feet. The climber made a quick right foot placement at a higher stance and send the left hand to match the right hand on the jug. Now that the climber is in the secure grip, meaning that it's a big lip that sticks out, the climber can rely on the force of the grips and disengage the arms, meaning he's leaning back and this is count as a rest position as he's able to rest the shoulders as well while he glances over for the next moves. Here we can see how the climber was able to make the reach up with the left hand to the next hold. And in this one, the right foot has remained with the leg extended. This one is called flagging in. And the flagging position is to keep the climber stable when making the move and keep his hips close to the wall. This is because the climber needed to transfer the weight over to the highest foot. And where the climber has placed the foot by putting the bottom of the sole towards the middle of the foot. The climber must press down on the hold to gain height when at the reach. Here the climber has engaged in a forceful pull to make the right hand positioning to the pinch. As we can see, the climber was able to gain reach due to pressing down on the foot down below. And to maintain the grip, the climber is placing the fingers onto the right side of the hold and the thumb on the other. This to generate power by pressing into the hold. The thumb will help the climber generate pressure to maintain a clamp position onto that hold. And as the climber had brought himself in, blocking the move, now the climber is going to be able to lean on that hold above.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The dancer should be using her hips more here when she's stepping forward with one foot. So this time it's her left foot That's stepping forward. She should be moving her hips on to a large very observable Extent to the opposite side. So when her left foot is coming forward, that means her hips should be moving to the right And that would be the same in reverse when her right foot comes forward. She should be moving her hips to her left The dancer is taking very small steps forwards and backwards and she needs to be taking larger steps using more of the floor. The dancer should hold her ending pose longer so that it is a clear punctuation mark at the end of her dance sentence and it's clear that the routine ends completely. She does a good job of straightening her right arm above her head, but she should just hold it there a bit longer. The dancer's right foot is very close to her standing leg or her left leg. She should be moving this foot further away. She also, though, in combination with bending her knees more when she lands, should be jumping higher into the air. And bending her knees also helps that purpose too, because when she bends her knees right before she jumps, or in between the jumps, it also helps her catapult herself into the air. So she should be jumping both up and horizontally. The dancer takes very small jumps here horizontally side by side and should be traveling further in space taking up more space and having more autonomy in her steps The dancer should also be bending her knees more when she lands so that the range of motion looks bigger. It would look like she's jumping higher if she bends lower when she lands. And that also helps to prevent injury and absorbs the shock or coats her knees and protects her knees. Here the dancer should widen her legs more and bend her knees more so that the step is bigger. On these jumps backwards too, she could be traveling again further backwards. She's staying in a small area of the room.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She hit a position too quickly with these arms back. And so she wasn't on the beat anymore. And that's unfortunate because she immediately, again, she doesn't hold her shapes very long. And so she was early for the music. And that does happen from time to time. But that's the even more opportunity to hold that position until you can't anymore musically. But she immediately dropped it. And so it really looks like a mistake. And again, does not look clear. So because she did not come through on the side of her leg and her hip, in this moment, she has to like take time to then bring the hip back or the knee back up and it looks really awkward and clunky. And it makes it so that she has to do like two to three to four movements as she falls rather than just like one. You can also see that she's not lined up over her hand here, and that's because I don't think she's conceptualizing this as her hand being a point of contact that she needs to put weight into. The weight needs to be right up over, the shoulder needs to be lined up right over the elbow, right over the wrist. So it looks like this was meant to be a body roll, but again she doesn't quite understand how to articulate very well through her spine yet, and so it again looks super stiff. You can see that her gaze is still forward, and so we get this sort of like breakage in the lines of her body. Let me draw that a little bit better. So we get a sort of an angle this way, we get an angle this way, and then we get this angle as well, and then these angles of these elbows. So it looks very stiff and angular, whereas a body roll is meant to look very smooth and undulating. So how she could do better with this is as she comes up, start with by gazing upwards, and then allowing that upward gaze to come forward to the position it's in now as the rest of the spine follows suit in a snake-like pattern. Another thing that's not helping is she's really jutting her pelvis forward here, and her weight is on the balls of her feet. It's really hard to do a spinal articulation from that position. It's better to have flat feet and a little bit of a soft knee, a little plie. So here she's done a great job of doing a nice deep plie and these arms are really nice, very specific energy out the fingertips. The issue is that she's kept her head in the same orientation through the previous two movements with her arm and this movement, so it detracts from the nice shape she's doing with the arms and legs. This would be much more effective if she looked up at her hands here in this moment. So this arm was up, it came down to her pubic bone and then upwards, but she never like fully finishes and follows through with this movement. You can see it just ends with this elbow upwards. It looks really, really awkward. I would love to see this fully unfold and come back up again before bringing it down to the next moment. Great footwork, good job staying in the balls of her feet. That helps her to keep the movement small, efficient, and quick and smooth, which is really nice. I wish that she wasn't bending at the wrist here so much. It's just a little too tense. It's not coming across as strong. It's coming across as tense. Unfortunately, she's again, she's kind of gotten to this sort of holding position that looks like a transition moment. It's not very strong. So I want her to continue dancing through her transitions rather than treating them as transitions. Better job with the attack of the arms coming down around and up. Pretty good energy out the fingertips and straight elbows. I love that she's way up high on the balls of her feet. It gives the whole movement an energy of upwardness which is really really nice and suited well to this style of dance and to this choreography. So again, the initiation of this movement is a little bit, is not sharp enough, but also the elbow, she's moving it out and up, and so it gives it more of a curved pathway, which is further making this movement look less sharp than it needs to be. Again, lack of clarity with the arms. She brings them down quickly, but in a sort of a flailing way, rather than a controlled way, and doesn't hold the shape. And so it doesn't read very well. It's kind of like, what was the point of that movement? It's kind of just here and then gone. So it's not very interesting to watch. So again, I wanna see more control, actually, in her case, and more dynamics. Again, lack of attack and also she's initiating this movement with her shoulders, which makes it look really amateurish. There's not enough softness through her knees and so that's partly why her movement looks very stiff. Adding a little softness, a little bit of spring can make the movement look a little bit smoother, a little bit more bouncy. This is an example of a poor transition moment. She just finished a turn and just freezes here. And sometimes it is appropriate to find a stillness, but this is not an interesting stillness to look at. There's really not much energy, again, not much energy coming out of her limbs. There's really nothing with the face or head position. The arms are in this really tense position and are still sort of moving even though she's still. And the legs are in this really weak, very close position. So from a viewer perspective, as an audience member who would be downstage, there's really nothing to see here. It's too collapsed and we're too small, too nonspecific and too tense. So here she's coming around into this twist again, lack of attack, lack of energy. So she really understands the basics of the choreography really well, understands the steps. It's that she's not adding this layer of texture, dynamic personality to it, and so it's a little bit lackluster. One reason that this movement is lackluster is because she's leading from her wrists here, so she's breaking at the wrists and leading the movement from the wrist, and that looks really weak. It's just not a weak place to start from. You can also see that she's got this really tight position here and this turned-in sort of hips, which is also making her dancing look very weak in this moment. So she did a good job arching and articulating through the lumbar spine, but did not really repeat that with the thoracic spine and has just moved basically the whole thoracic and cervical spine as one unit. And so she lost the nice spinal articulation that she set up at the beginning. So she needs to work on loosening up and articulating through her spine. This is very very weak. I don't understand why she chose to do it this way She's standing in this very non-specific shape with the feet They're just not far enough apart to be exaggerated or interesting or close enough together to be exaggerated or interesting one They're kind of slightly turned out from each other But the worst thing about this movement is that she's bringing these arms up and over in a fist and kind of making This X shape in front of her body, but she's doing it really really slowly But not in a controlled way it looks and I can tell it's not in a controlled way because She's really bending at the wrist elbow And so if it were more controlled it would just it would be even slower and a little bit more precise of a shape But the way she's doing it. It just looks super super weak So I would say either go way slower and add a lot of control or go very fast and hold each shape Because she would have extra music in that case so again she really lacks attack she lacks dynamics She lacks texture in her dancing which makes it uninteresting to watch So for some reason she brings this this leg was up in the layout and she brings it back toward her. That's really not where we how we typically end layouts because it doesn't look strong. The best way to end the layout is to step forward from where the foot just was and that just makes it look dynamic, interesting, and exaggerated. She wasn't able to do that because this knee, this the knee of the standing leg was so straight. There was no way that she was going to be able to step out further because she had such a straight knee. Her only choice was to bring it back and so that's why this is not successful in this moment. Good footwork here, nice job staying on the balls of the feet, good job balancing and counterbalancing with the arms. This looks really really strong. She's moving quickly because she's on the balls of her feet. Really nice little section here for her. The arms are really nice here because she's bringing them down and up and around in a really nice arc with straight elbows. The wrist here actually looks nice because it's kind of a graceful angle and there's energy out the fingers. Again though I would have loved to see a bit more attack as she comes down and then slowly bring it up. It's just a little bit too legato to really be strong and interesting to watch. So she did a good job with the arm, one arm behind her head, other arm behind her head very quickly in the timing here. But my issue is that she just kept looking straight forward and nothing really happened down here. It would have been much nicer if she looked one side or the, like maybe as this arm came up, looked in the opposite direction. And or as this arm came up, maybe pushing through the opposite hip, something like that to add some interest because the way that she did it, even though she was in the timing and had good attack there with those shapes, she looked very stiff because she just kept her gaze forward and her hips forward as well. Again, not enough attack. This looks really, really, really weak. I will say though that she did a good job standing up to, coming up to a standing position pretty quickly. Great attack as she brought her arms up and around. This is one of the best attacks that she's had the whole time and she's pretty much kept a nice straight elbow and nice fist here and that the fist looks intentional it looks strong and it looks symmetrical. So here she's coming down to the floor, but she hasn't even made contact fully with her hand, and that's not the correct way to do a fall. Best way is to bring the hand down first as your point of contact, and then swing the leg around through. And you want to swing the side of your leg around through so you don't smack your knee, and also it makes the fall smoother. And she's come down on the top of her knee, worried about injury over time, but also it looks quite clunky and heavy and awkward because of that. A little bit off the timing of the music here, she's actually too early for the beat, so she needed to take a little bit more time with her previous movement, slow it down a little bit. This is what I'm talking about with dynamics, finding these places of tension where a legato movement would actually be really helpful, and then finding these moments of release where a sharpness would be really helpful. So she could have added a little bit more legato to her previous movement so that she could attack this last moment right on the beat. Because she's a little bit early and it's the last movement, it really kind of detracts from her whole choreography. The ending and the beginning are like the most important parts of a choreography, and so when the ending is not strong, the piece is not strong. The shape itself is really nice, really nice angle here with the shoulders, elbows, energy out the fingertips. She's a little bit hyper flexible, so her shoulders are a bit far back and her elbows a bit hyper extended, but I'm okay with that in this moment. The shape is fine as is. I like this nice straight knee with the toes here. It looks strong. And then she just drops the shape and sort of just stands here very casually. Her arms are just at her sides as if she was just waiting for a bus or something. So, and she holds it for like an entire bar of music. So, she really just has lost the viewer's attention. It looks super unintentional and unclear. I would rather her hold the previous shape or make a new shape that looks intentional, that has some strength behind it, that has some energy behind it. This is just very weak and low energy. She came up really quickly here and in really good timing, great sharp attack. My issue is that she dropped the arms as she came up. And so again, there are moments like this where she's done something really nice, but she's detracting from the nice thing, beautiful thing that she did in some way. And in this case, it's because she dropped the arms before she was fully up. If she'd kept the arms up, it would have looked so much more impressive, but she's sort of like already moved on to the next thing. So this is an example where she didn't fully follow through with her movement. So again, that detracts from the movement because we don't get to see the whole movement before she moves on to the next thing. So this is a pretty good layout moment here for her. This would be even better though, if she, well, let me tell you why it's good. It's good because her elbows are really straight. She's in a 45 degree angle here, which is really nice because that's a very specific angle. Graceful bend through the wrist here and looking up at the ceiling, keeping the spine straight. This leg is nice and high, also very kind of specific angle, kind of pretty much 90 degrees. There's energy out her toes. So that's really, really nice. What I would say is that a layout really ideally would be a straight line from the toes to the head. She's not doing that. It's kind of broken here. And so it makes it look a tiny bit stiff. One way that she could get there better is if she had more of a plie, lower of a softer knee here so that she has a little bit more flexibility in terms of freedom of choice to move this upper part of her body more. Also probably a little bit of core strength would be helpful and really thinking of it as being flat and just make it that much more effective. This is such a great shape here and she does a really good job achieving it because as her arms are coming up she does a sort of a roll with her wrists to get them into this shape and it looks really strong especially because she keeps her feet close together here with a straight knee it kind of looks almost like an Egyptian sculpture or something. It's such a nice straight beautiful moment. Unfortunately again she does not hold it long enough for it to read very well. This would be so, I mean she really loses all the beauty of these shapes that she's making occasionally because she doesn't hold them for long enough so a little bit more attack so that she has time musically to hold it for just a millisecond so we can really see this beautiful shape she made. Again, lack of clarity here with the arms. She punched them downwards, but then immediately pulled the elbows up. So, we don't get to see any shape. So, it looks really awkward. Again, lack of attack bringing these arms forward. She doesn't straighten them for long enough for it to read as a shape. The fist looks good. Both fists are very strong and the position of the arms is great. It's just again, she lacks attack. I think she just needs to work generally on her muscle strength so that she can get good attack with things. I do like that she's moving into the hip here. It really adds a lot of interest to the shapes that she's making with her body in this movement. She does achieve a great tabletop position here, pretty great, because there's a 90 degree angle of the knee and of the ankle and so that helps this to look flat. Unfortunately she's still at too wide of an angle with the arm here, but pretty, pretty good job there. Also this arm looks pretty strong coming up which helps to further accentuate the tabletop position. So here she started the choreography. Great job getting onto the balls of her feet here. That will help to keep her movement nice and light. Pretty good shape here with a straight elbow, energy out the fingertips, and sort of 90 degree angle with the shoulder. Unfortunately she lacks the attitude and dynamics and personality that this movement could really have. So she's got the shape but how she got into it a little bit too slow, a little bit too smooth, kind of gazing in this non-specific angle here. Just yeah it just lacks interest. It just really doesn't grab the viewer's interest. So I'd love to see a little bit more of her personality coming through and a little bit more sharpness and getting to this shape. She's doing a pretty good job here of using the balls of her feet as her pivot point rather than her hips and I can tell because she's pretty much keeping her feet parallel and she's just transferring her weight from the ball of one ball of one foot to the ball of the other foot, which is nice. And her arm shape looks really strong. This is a great shape with the arm but again she lacks sharpness in her initiation of the movement and so she loses, we can't really see this shape for long enough, so she loses the nice shape. She's got such beautiful long limbs and sometimes really good extension like in this case but because she doesn't attack it, it gets lost. This is a really weak moment for her again I think she just needs to like go to the gym and do some other things to work on her arm strength and thinking about Really the initiation. Where is the initiation of this movement coming from? She's initiating it by bending and straightening her elbows slightly And so she gets this like really weak looking little bounce to the arms I think that it would be better if she was initiating it more from her center from her core or even from the shoulders Rather than the elbows because it just looks yeah, it just looks weak It looks like she doesn't have a lot of experience with this particular movement Great start to this movement. She's got a great plie. Her weight is a bit forward. I'd love to see just a little bit more weight back here, but regardless, the initiation of the movement of the spine here is really nice because she's creating this sort of backward C shape. And then the idea with this type, with this particular movement, is to then articulate the spine downward, kind of vertebrae by vertebra, and end up in the opposite C position down. So we'll see if she continues that trajectory. The arms look really strong. The elbows nice and, not straight, the elbows nice and bent and at a great angle away from her body so they're not collapsed inward. So it's a really strong shape here with the arms as well. So now she's running backwards here again. There's not enough energy There's just not enough energy the run the steps are way too small to be of any interest The arms are just again non-specific. They're just a little bit reacting to the step rather than being Helping her or making an image and so it just looks like a transition moment and it just looks like somebody walking backwards rather than someone doing a dance performance and also Whatever she's about to do next will not be as successful because she didn't really go for it I would actually recommend instead of thinking about running backwards Most people have a are nervous like they're your our brains don't want us to go backwards because we can't see backwards And so we have to fight that when we're going backwards in order to make it look very dancey and exaggerated So what I would say is instead of telling her, okay, I want you to run backwards here I would tell her I want you to do a few leaps backwards because if she thinks about it more like leaping she's not It will just make the movement bigger and more exaggerated and also prepare her better for whatever she's going to do next Here she's just frankly behind the music because she's not attacking this movement enough. She came up here way too slowly and so she's actually late. And also the lack of dynamics further makes this an ineffective moment. And again, it's unfortunate because look, she's way up high on the balls of her feet. That takes a lot of strength. That takes a lot of power. The arms look really strong. Her chin is jutted a bit forward. I'd love to see it just a little bit further in. But regardless, the arms are strong. Great angle with the shoulder. Nice straight elbow. Great energy out the fingertips. And again, being way high up on her toes, it's very impressive. But she gets there so slowly that number one, the lack of dynamic makes it less interesting. But also the fact that it makes her late for the music is not okay. Great attack here. She brought this arm, this right arm in front of her body and around and is leading with her elbow here. It looks really, really strong. Nice sharpness. This is something I want her to recreate throughout her dancing. Great attack and great arm movements here. So finally I'm seeing more attack with her movement. This arm looks really strong, straight elbow, nice fists here. This is the second repetition of this and both times she did a great attack. The leg looks really nice because she's brought this knee nice and high but without tilting her pelvis and while keeping a great posture. So really great little moments for her here. Here she's doing this crossover turn. She didn't quite cross over far enough with her legs in order to make this turn effective. And also she's trying to do the turn on the balls of her feet. This crossover turn is much better when the pivot point is with one heel and the other ball of the foot. So she's really not going to, she's just not executing this correctly. Her weight's also a little bit further back than it needs to be and her plie is a bit too deep and so it looks quite awkward, as well as her head looking, her gaze upward doesn't really help her and also again, makes it look quite stiff and awkward. Again, really nice footwork. Actually, in this moment, she's back onto a flat foot, but as she's moving through this basic step, she's pretty much staying on the ball of her foot, which is making the movement a little bit lighter. She just brought this toe out and back behind her very quickly. Great attack, great movement with the feet. Good musicality, she hit her arms up really quickly right on the music, but again, didn't hold it long. If you can see, she's already coming down at the end of that beat. And so, just really working on taking up all of the music, and if you're going to attack something, really give it a moment to sink in for your viewer. It just makes the dancing more impressive. Pretty good arc here with this arm. She brought it really, did a good job bringing it all the way to her front and now around to her back. Unfortunately, she kind of breaks it here. So I just want to see more strength in her arm shape here. More of a kind of a curve would be really, really nice as long as she could keep that curve. She's really got more of a bend here. This arm looks really good, nice and strong and clear. The gaze is not working for her. Again, there's like a lack of personality coming through and that's partly because she's just sort of still gazing off in this direction, even though the arm is doing something really interesting. So I would suggest just doing a little bit of something different with the gaze, a little something different with the facial expression. There's just not a lot of energy coming out of her, which is not grabbing the viewer's attention very well. Unfortunately, she lost that really nice shape. I would like to see if she brought, so she had both arms in the air with fists, really nice shape, and held it for long enough for it to read. But as she brought this one down, she allowed this one to bend. And so again, it compromises the nice shapes that she's making. Also here, she's quite straight through this knee, and she's really like pushing the pelvis forward and keeping it as one unit with the rest of her spine. So this also looks quite awkward and stiff.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Her feet are able to find more clarity again, and she uses her pelvis to sway side to side in a way that feels natural and connected to the music. However, now that her and her partner are disconnected, she starts to use her arms in this kind of floating manner above her head, which feels a little bit disconnected from what's happening in her lower body. Overall, she could just use some more clarity in the choreography of her arms in particular. As the dancer transitions, unfolding and turning out from her partner while staying connected with one singular hand, she struggles a little bit through this transition, which perhaps could be the fault of the leading partner that's guiding her. Nevertheless, she falls off the rhythm here quite significantly and appears a little bit confused in what movement she's expected to perform next. Overall, she's kind of got this very pedestrian stance. You can see her shoulders are a little bit more curved than they were before, indicating she might be less confident. And she's kind of lost that movement that she had in her pelvis prior, which showed that she was confident in embodying the rhythm. As the dancer performs what appears to be a take on the Charleston, she performs a series of kicks with her right leg while her left leg remains supporting. As she's performing this step, she would really benefit from making her movements a bit smaller here. Because she's kicking her leg so wide out from underneath her pelvis, she's disconnecting from the rhythm and not able to move as quickly and efficiently as she would want to in order to keep the embodiment of the rhythm here. As the dancer begins to freestyle a bit more, incorporating some jumps, some kicks, and some more non-traditional movement into her freestyle, she goes in and out of connecting with the rhythm, she would just really benefit from some additional rehearsal and added clarity here of the choreography. However, overall, she really has a nice energy about her, and she's able to move quickly and efficiently through the steps, not getting too caught up in the transitions, particularly now as she's dancing disconnected from her partner. Thank you. As the primary dancer begins this movement phrase by performing a series of step touches, moving side to side and swaying her hips side to side, she's able to effectively engage her pelvis, her torso, and down through her lower body, her legs, and her feet. However, she's got a lot of movement happening in her arms, and while it's great that she's utilizing her arms, it feels a bit distracting from the movement and tends to throw her off the rhythm a little bit. Her arms are just kind of floating above her head, moving in this very light and kind of indirect sustained pattern, which feels like there is a bit too much movement happening in the upper body that's really disconnected from the movement that's happening in the torso and below. As the dancer performs this one-legged turnaround herself, she's able to do so quickly and efficiently, particularly thanks to the use of her head as she's spotting her head through this movement, which keeps her stable and able to move quickly and with a lot of clarity here. She also has a nice shaping of her left arm, which is neatly connected to her hip with her elbow out, and she's lifting her right leg in a way that might be throwing her off balance slightly, but feels appropriate for the movement overall. In general, she executes the turn with a lot of fluency and understanding of the movement vocabulary. After performing a series of turns, the dancer again appears a little bit unconfident or unsure of what performance or what piece of the performance comes next. Again, I'm not sure if this is to her fault or the fault of her leading partner who is audibly saying that he's not very good at the performance or he doesn't quite know what he's doing or similar sentiments. So I can't fully blame her for falling off the rhythm here, but overall she really does disconnect from the rhythm and she demonstrates that she struggles to transition from one step to another. As the dancer is performing a series of rock steps and triple steps with her partner, she is not engaging her arms in a significant way, but that's very appropriate as she's using them to connect physically with her partner. She's also able to maintain her embodiment of the rhythm, particularly in the lower body in the feet. In this instance, she's able to stay on rhythm and perform the movement with clarity and efficiency.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Because I think the next hole is one of these guys. So he is actually set up really nicely to kind of go bigger. But instead he kind of tries to force the hand match and just is not able to do so. So starting, he looks really nice. His arms are nice and engaged. These holes do not look to be that amazing. He looks really confident. His arms are nice and tense, but not overly pulling in. He seems to have a nice foot spacing. He's got this higher right foot, and this left foot's a little bit lower. And so actually that final right foot would actually be really good before he just slipped off right there because then he'd be opposite posed. You could do a little back leg, right foot up, you know, and then he's got right foot on, left foot on, right foot on, left hand on. And you should be able to tension and kind of just push up and grab this big kind of side pull, pinchy, slopey, juggy thing.

As you can hear the sizzling sound, the pan for an omelette, depending on the style of your liking, it's a bit too hot so it creates that sound for a crispier bottom and not necessarily like a quicker cooking. If you want a smoother omelette, it would be a little bit less on the heat and not as hot when you add your egg mixture. So we're making an omelette. This gentleman is collecting all the tools and ingredients. We call it maize and plaz, which is a great effective way to have everything ready for prepping and when you start to cook. Nice that he's swirling the oil around the pan to make it coat the bottom of the pan evenly It is a great idea to create a little pile on the counter on the discard from the vegetables.

In either scenario, they need to shift their left hand to make space for the right for the move to work. So this is good even though the climber opts to come back to this position, they actually feel out the start a few different ways to see if there's a better way to begin the problem. So it's a really good technique from the ground because it's a few spots where you can actually feel body position without actually waiting the hold and using an attempt. So they were eventually able to switch hands and almost had the right hand in the hold, but rather than going forward, they tried to bring the left hand back to the starting position, which was just going to trap them, so they fall as a result.

She has one arm higher than the other and this is alternating with every step that she takes so that's really good that she's also using her arms in these basic salsa dance steps and it's not solely concentrated on her feet. The dancer should widen her stance. On these jumps, her feet are close together and should be further apart. The dancer's left arm that is extended could have more energy. She should straighten her arm at her elbow joint so that it's not bent and also lift it so that it's aligned with her shoulder. Here the dancer is high on her toes with her heels lifted off the ground when she's twisting which allows her more more space to twist. And this is good this foot, the way in which she's balancing her weight on her feet right now is what I was saying before what she should have done when she was doing the basic salsa step forward and backwards. Also, the dancer's arms are at the same angle. She's making a V here, but the angle of her arms are exactly the same. So that's really good. The dancer's arms are really good here. They're extended completely, both her right and her left arm, with energy radiating outwards. The dancer is taking very little steps on these basic salsa steps. She's taking up only a small space on the floor. She should instead be taking bigger steps, traveling further forwards and backwards. The dancer should also bend her knees more when she's landing so that the jump could have a greater range of motion. So it would look like she jumped higher if she bends her knees more when she lands so that the level changes easier to see. The dancer should shimmy her shoulders to a greater extent so that there's more movement. She just requires more energy overall. She is shimming her shoulders, but this could be much bigger. The dancer is also stepping on flat feet. She's dancing flat-footed.

And in this movement we can see that the climber is doing a dynamic movement. But one thing I want to definitely point out is what we can see is with her left arm here, we can kind of see how much she's pulling in with her body right here, or with her upper body. So that kind of shows to me that the climber is really relying on her upper body to be the main force or the main power to get her up into this next position. But what I would actually encourage for the climber is if she kind of strained out her arms a little bit more. So then that way she can kind of focus on transitioning her body weight more over this left foot here. Just because it does seem like that left foot is a pretty big foot to utilize. So she should be able to use it in a better way. And trying to avoid how much her upper body is doing right now because it does take away from how much her lower body can work right now. And so here we can see that as the climber is getting closer to reaching that left hand that they're aiming for We can see that the left foot has now slipped off of the foothold here And one of the main reasons why I think that is is because the climber is focusing so much on Getting their upper body closer to the wall And by producing the power with their upper body it helps to take away some of their body weight from their feet And as a result, that's why their left foot is coming off this foothold right here But because that foothold is now off the wall and we can see the rest of the body Is starting to fall away from the wall as well So it does mean that the climber has a harder time of actually grabbing on to that left and hold that they're aiming for", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Instead of keeping the arms straight and swaying the hips back and forth, the climber tries to maybe get a little more punchy with it with their arms and lock them down. It's really important to tweak the beta. I do think that this is not going to allow the climber to get much higher on the wall and thus come even shorter up on the hold. And the climber comes up pretty short going for the target hold. Um, it's very common for climbers to think about what to do with their arms. Um, and it takes a little bit more experience to really understand that most moves, especially like jumps like this are actually about recruiting more from the legs and you can see that. This is the start foot, but here's the climbers foot. So their foot's actually lower than the foot that they're driving off of.

He's got a deeper bend in his knees with his pelvis dropped back and activated within the movement and is finding a lot of nice clarity in his footwork here. Overall, this is a high point for the dancer, a moment of shine where they really appear confident and clear in their movement. As the dancer continues into this transitional step that's locomoting him through the space and also incorporates kind of a chasse and a ball change here with his feet, he's going in and out of connection with the rhythm, particularly in the use of his footwork when he performs the chasse or the small jump in between ball change steps. He's struggling to keep that connected to the rhythm. However, he's got this nice soft bend in his knees, his pelvis is loose, and his upper body appears relaxed. He's also got a nice point of connection with his arm with his partner, which overall demonstrates that he might not be able to fully embody the rhythm, but he does have a working understanding of the movement vocabulary. As the dancer transitions into this walking pattern or this kind of exaggerated walk where they're really stepping their heel down, keeping their toe lifted, and then dropping their toe rhythmically, they're more deeply connected to the rhythm here. They have a nice sense of bounce in their movement, which is connecting them to the music. And it's particularly thanks to the soft bend in their knees and the nice kind of loose activation of their pelvis. As the dancer transitions back into this chasse ball change or this triple step into a rock step movement, they appear much more confident than they did at the beginning of the dance. They have a sense of ease about their movement, which is connecting them to the rhythm. They're maintaining a nice soft bend in their knees with an active range of motion in their pelvis, which is helping them to move quickly and efficiently. As a dancer begins with the basic step that's locomoting him through the space slightly with his partner, he is struggling to connect to the rhythm right away, particularly through his footwork. While he has some clarity in the mechanics of the footwork, he's struggling to connect them to the rhythm and he would benefit from bending the knees a bit more, finding a soft bend there, as well as incorporating some motion up through the pelvis so that he could be more stable, consistent, and connected to the rhythm. As the dancer goes to transition into the twist here with their legs from a rock step or a small jump into a rock step, they really struggle with this transition. They could probably just use a bit more rehearsal here, especially some rehearsal with their partner so that they could even out their weight distribution and their movement pattern, but overall they need to find some clarity and some refinement through this transitional moment. As the dancer faces their partner again and performs this chasse with a ball change backwards or a triple step in a rock step, it might be called in some social dances, they are struggling to perform the rock step because they're not allowing themselves to have enough bend in their knees. So it's really limiting their range of motion in their legs as well as their pelvis, which is keeping them disconnected from the rhythm in general. If they were to bring a softer bend to their knees, dropping their pelvis back and down, they would have more control over the rock step and be able to connect more consistently with the music. As the dancer transitions into this chasse step where he's moving throughout the room locomoting slightly, particularly forward and backwards within the space, he starts to catch a connection to the rhythm here and stays fairly consistent as he starts to perform this step. He's finding some clarity in his footwork as well as some deeper embodiment of the rhythm, has a nice soft bend in his knees which is helping him to move quickly and efficiently, and overall has a confident and soft presence.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This is a very musical gesture and he did it very fluidly. The guitarist is alternating playing two notes at once and also one single note, creating this strumming pattern. The guitar has a really nice light touch and has a really nice sound because they have this really excellent strumming technique. It's very relaxing to listen to. The guitarist gets lost, and so he's repositioning to get back on track. The guitarist is doing a really nice job of making any sudden movements. Their playing is very fluid and the music reflects that. The guitarist has a really nice feel for the instrument. You're getting up and down the fingerboard really well. They know exactly the right amount of weight to put also into the strumming. They have a really laid back feel to their sound, which is really pleasant. The guitarist has a very relaxed hand shape. You can tell because there's this natural spacing between the fingers. The fingers aren't buckling in the knuckles and they're not spreading out, which would be signs of too much tension. The guitarist has a little bit of uncoordination here. This last note that they play has a bit of an abrupt sounding to it, like they stopped the ringing of the string. They should just make sure that they practice slowly so that they don't make a mistake like that. Guitarist is doing a really nice job in this section, having a really nice musical touch with their right hand. To improve it, they could try to even do a little bit more shape so it's very obvious what to be listening for. The guitarist fumbles their fingers around trying to find the next chord. They should just make sure that they practice the previous chord and then this current chord back and forth multiple repetitions. This last chord, their finger here slips off the string, causing for the note to be unclear. They should just make sure they practice that shift slowly so they can feel like every single one of their fingers lands where it needs to. Although this section starts to feel very free, it starts to feel like there's no continuous beat or tempo for the structure, it starts to feel a bit unclear. It'd be good for them just to go through this section with a metronome and feel what the structure is again. It might make more sense then. The coordination with the picking hand could be a little bit better here to make sure they bring out the single notes so that they don't get swallowed up. They can make sure they practice things very slowly so they have the coordination down. The guitarist is getting around well here between these chords, but this should really highlight what's happening musically, focusing more on the melodic line and making sure that that is the priority that's coming out. The guitarist drums the strings and plays a chord. This last chord doesn't speak as well. Their finger is right on the fret. They should aim to make sure that it's between the frets or right before them so that they get the clearest sound possible. The guitarist's finger gets really close to the fret, which is causing the note to be blocked. This last note doesn't speak properly because the coordination between their left hand and their right hand is a little off. The pinky may not have enough weight in the string for it to get clarity. The moving notes start to get a little bit quiet here. You can try to use the pick a little bit more, just a little bit more weight to make sure that those notes are coming out. If the guitarist misses the chord that they're going to, they should just practice the shift going to the previous chord and to this current chord back and forth so they know exactly where their fingers are supposed to go. Again, this is another example that the guitarist has a very nice relaxed hand shape. There's a lot of equal spacing between their fingers and they have a nice curved hand that goes into the string. You're using a pick that they're holding to use to strum the strings.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

At times it is speeding up and slowing down. It would help to practice this section of a piece using a metronome to work on maintaining one even playing speed. Here the violinist is playing with a very rich full sound at a loud dynamic level. Again, here when shifting to this higher pitch, the intonation was a bit off at first and the violinist adjusted to improve the tuning a bit. The violinists successfully transition to a very different section of the piece. They're now playing a more rhythmically challenging section and are changing pitches more frequently. The violinist is playing these phrases with accurate pitch and rhythm. Here the violinist has returned to playing a single line melody or individual pitches at a time. They are continuing to demonstrate beautiful legato or smooth and connected notes. The violinist successfully shifted to a much more delicate and smooth style of playing here. Here was the only spot in this section so far where the angle and weight of the bow needed to be adjusted. You could hear a slightly screechy sound quality to one of the pitches that was just played. Here the violinist is again playing double stops that are very legato or smooth and connected. They are doing a good job when shifting to different spots on the fingerboard while playing these. Here they are getting a nice legato sound or their notes are very smooth and connected due to their proper bowing technique and distribution of the bow's weight evenly over the strings that are being played. Again here this higher pitch in the phrase was a bit out of tune at first after shifting and then the violin quickly adjusted their fingers position on the fingerboard to get it more in tune. The violinist again corrected their intonation and adjusted their fingers position on the fingerboard So that when they repeated this note that was originally out of tune Again, it was more in tune It would definitely help to practice the pitch before the shift, leading into it a few times while keeping an eye on the left hand fingers and their placement on the fingerboard to work on improving the intonation when shifting. Here, the violinist hummed a part played by a different instrument, which will help them to time their next entrance. Here the violinist is getting a beautiful sound and there are longer held pitches. They are using a nice amount of vibrato. Here there was a bit of a screechy sound quality when approaching the string on the violin. It would help to adjust the weight and angle of the bow a bit to get a smoother sound here. The violinist is demonstrating great bowing technique when needing to go back and forth from string to string pretty frequently during this section of the piece. The violinist is playing with very full bow strokes in this section, which is allowing their notes to be smooth and connected. Again here they are performing a trill or a style of ornamentation. This time they are playing at an even more rapid speed going back and forth between two pitches repeatedly. Here the violinist is doing a good job of distributing the weight of the bow over the strings that are needed and is moving back and forth between strings, maintaining a nice sounding tone. Here the violinist is demonstrating their ability to play with much more intensity. They are playing multiple strings at the same time, a repetitive rhythmic pattern, and they are doing so at a full or loud dynamic level. The violinist is continuing to play with a beautiful legato sound. They are maintaining a proper bow hold. Their left hand fingers have been curved. It would just help to straighten out the left thumb a bit to avoid causing any tension in the left hand. Here the violinist is doing a good job alternating between playing single note melody and multiple strings at the same time. Here you can see the violinist continuing to maintain a proper bow hold and their left hand fingers are curved over the fingerboard. The violinist is again using full bow strokes here which is allowing them to get a nice legato sound to their playing. Here, there seemed like there might have been some uncertainty with this pattern of pitches. There was some separation between the notes. It could help to review this phrase a few times, practicing at a slower tempo to get more familiar with the pattern of pitches and to play the sequence of notes in this phrase more smooth and connected. Here, the intonation was much better when shifting this time. Here the violinist is performing a run or a fast-moving melodic line. They are playing this with pitch and rhythmic accuracy. Here, the violinist is performing some trills, or when you go back and forth between two pitches multiple times at a faster speed. Here the violinist is demonstrating a crescendo or when you gradually get louder and louder Which makes this phrase sound more exciting The violinist is performing a more lyrical piece. Their notes are smooth and legato and connected and on their longer held rhythms they are using vibrato. Here you can see how the bow is evenly distributed over the two strings that are being used for this current double stop. Here the violinist is performing double stops and they are doing a good job distributing the weight of their bow evenly between the two strings that are being played. The violinist is getting a beautiful rich tone here, and again, they are using some trills to ornament this phrase. Here there seemed to possibly be some uncertainty with this pattern of notes and the articulation could be a bit clearer. It would help to review this phrase a few times at a slower tempo to get the pattern more clear and confident sounding. Here you can see the violinist demonstrating a proper bow hold. Their fingers are relaxed when gripping and bowing and right now they're doing a good job going back and forth between two pitches on two different strings of the violin. Here the violinist is playing a more rhythmically challenging section and has a faster moving Melodic line they are playing with accurate pitches and rhythms so far The violinist is playing this phrase with a beautiful full tone and accuracy with pitch and rhythm. Here, the intonation could be improved a bit when shifting from the higher pitch to this next lowest pitch in the phrase. Again, here the intonation was a bit off after shifting. Here the violinist is playing more double stops and they are doing a good job shifting to different spots on the fingerboard. The violinist concluded their piece with a nice long sustained set of pitches and a beautiful tone quality. When shifting to the note heard here or the higher pitch in this phrase, the note was a little bit out of tune or flat at first and the violin is quickly adjusted to get the pitch more in tune. It would help to practice the higher pitch and then shifting to the next lowest pitch in the phrase at a slow tempo Possibly using a tuner while keeping an eye on the left hand fingers placement on the fingerboard To get these pitches a bit more in tune", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So here's one of the parts where I think she improvised a bit when she turned around and did a little clap, but it worked perfectly because she was able to fill in the music correctly to be able to step out on the correct bit of music. Here again, just showing her range of motion. Her shoulders are square to the front. Her right foot steps over in front and twists her lower body in half. So really nice job just keeping the movement and twisting using her flexibility to her advantage. So overall this dancer, really good example, really great example for this advanced choreography. She had a really nice high consistent level of energy throughout. Her technique was strong and she did a little improv in some of the movements as well. So overall, really nice job. Here, really nice job rolling back. The knees could be bent just a little bit more, but she has a really nice energy with her arms and then the eyes are looking forward. So really nice job there. So here when she jumps out side to side, nice job keeping the legs open. The knees can bend just a little bit more, but she does a good job swinging her arms and then jumping side to side. So here she's taking a salsa step forward and back. I like that she steps and then does like a double tap. It not only keeps her body movement but it does add a little extra to the energy of her movement by just keeping that movement flowing and going without stopping on the exact beat. So here I felt like her arms got a little messy. They just weren't quite as in place as I think they could have been. And I think it ranges more from her hands, not mostly her arms, but just more of her hands. So really thinking about your full body, so all the way to your fingertips, just like all the way to your toes, just having everything have a very clear place. So here when she rolls up, I kind of wish she would have rolled more from her head on down, but she used more of her shoulder, which is still fine, but just I think it's more of a dancer's preference. But I think she would have had more flow of movement throughout her full body if she started from her head instead of from her shoulder. Here in the beginning, just a technique, she does a really good job twisting her full body around. As you notice, her chest and shoulders are still facing the front, but her hips are completely shifted over to the side, so it just shows her flexibility in her back and how well she's able to twist her body.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

All because that right knee is kind of facing inwards and all that pressure is kind of being applied the opposite way. And there's also one more thing with his left foot when he makes the jump that could be a little bit cleaner. So here we can see he starts to climb good, his arms are nice and straight. He's going up to this green hold up to the right, so you can see his right knee is facing outwards. He can kind of, he starts in a good position so he can kind of rock over and spring from it. But when he actually makes the jump, you'll see that his right knee goes from facing outwards to the right, more towards inward to the left. And his left foot kind of does this little kind of all scorpion move right away. So that's kind of also going to be sending his weight kind of straight back instead of upwards. So, between the one knee, between the right foot kind of pushing him left and this one's going to kind of be pushing him right. So, it's like it's going to be kind of a lot of twisting his body and nothing's kind of furthering his push upwards into the right. So, this is all going to kind of work against him to limit his power. So now you can see that his left knee has turned inwards, which means when he pushes down it's kind of pushing down at this angle. So as he kind of swings up to go this way, the pressure on that foot is actually going to kind of send him out from the wall. It's going to cause him to kind of come out from the wall like this. So he's kind of applying the force in the wrong direction instead of rocking over onto it.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She's also spotting her head in the direction that she wants to end up which is going to help even further make this turn nice and crisp and sharp down the center of her body as her center rotation point. The small pivot point of the ball of the foot is also helping to keep a small pivot rotation point here so that this can be a very efficient, quick, smooth, dynamic turn. This is a great moment. She's very good at these sort of undulating movements, these isolations. She's isolating mostly through the pelvis here and doing sort of the opposite movement with her hands and she's accentuating the pelvic movement by sort of cupping her bum here, which just sort of goes like, hey look at this cool thing I'm doing with my pelvis. Also great stage presence, great facial expression. She's right on the music. She's got a nice solid base here with her feet at a good wide distance and a little bit of a soft knee. This is a great transition moment because she just completed this movement where she rotated her head around with her hands on the sides of her head. And she has this like little brief millisecond of music before she has to do the next arm movement. So she sort of unfolds her arms in this really specific and lovely way before bringing them up to the next shape so that there's no lag, there's no delay, there's no pause where she's just sort of standing there. She's really dancing through her transition here. Just a little bit of a weak transition for her here. She's still moving with her legs really, really well dynamically. She's moving from her core, but she kind of holds her arms in this non-shaped position here, a little bit vague. There's a little bit of a jerkiness here. So I think she may be thinking about what's coming next, and it just kind of comes across as like sort of jerky transition moment here. Great preparation here with this front leg and a nice plie to prepare her for her turn. She's walking forward here now and doing a really nice job with this right arm. She brought it in front of her first with a bent elbow and swung it down and around and is making a really nice complete arc as she comes through here. This other arm is also very specific. She just placed it very simply on the chest, but it's keeping it nice and clear and strong the whole time. I wish that this kick was as dramatic and strong as the first one. The first time she had her opposite arm in front here. So in this case, it would be more like this. And then this arm would be this way. And she would be looking towards this arm. And a little bit more twist. She had a more twist before. The pelvis was facing directly downstage, even though the kick was to the previous side was stage right. So in this case, it would be stage left, but the pelvis would be downstage. So this is a little bit of an inconsistency, because she's just not doing this as fully as she did the first one. And so it loses its luster. Again looks a little bit confused about what she's supposed to be doing. Maybe she forgot. It's just a very obvious transition moment because it's a little bit awkward. For a moment, she just briefly looked to her left and now is looking this way again. Non-specific with the arms. A little bit of an awkward shape here. So another transition that she could really work on dancing through. Here she's pushing with the ball of the front foot. She had a plie here and now she's pushing, you can tell she's pushing really well through this leg because the knee is almost straight at this point but the ball of the foot is still on the floor. So she's pushing into the floor with the ball of the foot to transfer her weight onto the back leg, a back ball of the foot. So now she can turn on the ball of her foot with all the energy generated from this downward push transferring into the ball of the foot. Great shape here too. Part of the reason that she can make this shape quickly is because she does this very quick bend of the elbows and then releases the energy outward at the last second right in time with the music. There's also great energy out of the fingertips, straight elbows, and great attack to what she's doing so that she has a moment to hold the shape so it reads as a shape before she moves on. I like that she's looking over her shoulder because it accentuates this line. Really great dynamics here. She really shot these arms up quickly. She attacked it. She put a lot of energy into the movement But and so because she did that she had enough time to hold the shape so it can read as a shape before she moves On there's great energy out her fingertips as well I also love this moment for her. You can see she's loving what she's doing. Great smile on her face. Really graceful as she came up here with this arm and again really kind of leading from the core outwards which looks super lovely and strong. I like that as she's beginning this head movement, she's very quickly slamming this foot out. Not slamming is not the right word, but jutting this foot out to put weight on it, which will help her in the movement. She's doing a pretty full shape here with the pathway here with the head and the hands are staying pretty stable here on the sides of the head. They're not moving, so it makes it for a pretty clear shape. I'd love if the elbows could stay a little bit further out rather than collapsed in slightly here. It just kind of detracts from the shape. Another bar or two here that where it's kind of dragging again not a lot of interest in what she's doing a little bit jerky of movement here as well. So again dancing through the transitions and finding ways to exaggerate all the movement. This is not very good turn technique. She's planted her foot here, which means she's gonna have to rotate around her hip She's also sort of raising this shoulder to turn from the shoulder as an initiation point, which isn't very strong This is really nice. So she's basically just doing a super simple transition where she's transferring her weight From one foot to the well on the right foot while bringing the left leg around and this could be super boring But what she does is she has this really really simple Small movement where she has straightened her elbows slightly flicked her wrists and then is now bringing them back in and that's why they look kind Of blurry in this moment so that what we see is someone who's connecting these movements She's dancing through her transition moment here, which is super super strong You It's a little bit dragging here, these four bars. She's doing these sorts of steps in a sort of a box shape, these kind of basic salsa steps. And there's just not a whole lot of interest to grab onto there. The way she's, different facings that she's doing are not super specific. She's on the balls of her feet the whole time, which is great, but the arms are a little bit weak. So this little section kind of drags a bit. So I'd just encourage her to find some ways to make it bigger, more exaggerated, and keep it more interesting and more specific. This is really nice too. She's really planting this foot so that she can really bring this hip out. So again a nice undulating movement as she's traveling in this direction. Strong arms which are helping to accentuate the movement and great facial expression as well. And also really really smoothly moving across the floor because she's slightly on the balls of her feet. This is really nice little section for her here. She's really doing this sort of spinal articulation starting from the hip coming out and then working all the way up her body. It looks so, so lovely. It's almost like there's this internal movement that's coming out of her core, which looks so strong and beautiful. It just looks so natural and yeah, just really lovely to watch. And she's accentuating that movement with a really strong arm shape sort of following the hips here. She's also got great stage presence. She's clearly enjoying what she's doing and really feeling it, which is really nice to see because again, facial expressions and emotion help to connect her to her audience. So good. She's a little bit late on the music here at the beginning, but she's making really strong shape. She really attacked the movement so that she could get a pretty straight line on this kick. Also really strong shapes with the arms here, very, very clear what she's trying to do. Lots of energy, especially out of these fingertips. There's not energy necessary. Well, there actually is really good energy and grace with this hand as well. Also, she's got a facial expression. She's kind of like, oh, in this moment. So she's got good stage presence, and this is a great start to this choreography. So here the knee is coming up as she's turned around here. I think that what so what she did was she stepped onto this leg with the flat foot and then as the other knee is coming up then she's rising onto the ball of the foot. I just don't think this was a very good choice in terms of executing this turn well because going from a plie to being way up on the ball of the foot it means that she's having to push her whole body up or pull her whole body up against gravity and that's a lot of work and she's not really doing it with much support. So what I would say it would be better is push into the back foot before that knee even comes up to really transfer the weight onto this foot as the knee is coming up because then it would be much more dynamic and she could actually turn while bringing the knee up. She kind of turned before bringing the knee up and that's because she wasn't prepared very well. She's also sort of collapsing this left shoulder forward as the knee is coming up which means that she's not really using her core super well here and there's also nothing happening of interest with the arm. So those are a few things that would make this moment stronger. Great follow-through here this arm this hand has come around the head here in This sort of a shape and she's completing that movement fully before moving on to the next movement Really strong position of a lunge here through both legs After she slapped her knee with this hand, she's now brought it down and now both arms are continuing the windmill with straight elbows. So this is what I'd like to see the whole time when she does this windmill. Looks really nice. Very clear position of the foot here, very specific. Looks really nice. Again, you can see the drama in this moment. You can see the exaggeration of the movement. She's not holding back She's putting a lot of energy into what she's doing, but not too much energy It's just the right amount so that it looks exaggerated. It looks strong She's also really well coordinated between her arms and legs and also between her torso and her limbs Which is really helpful. She's moving from her core. She's moving as she travels. She's moving from her pelvis So really great coordination and great exaggeration here This turn of the pelvis to her left is really helping her to get an even more dramatic Internal rotation of the hip here. She's putting some strength into this ankle as well So her foot's not just dangling there and then a great twist between the torso and the pelvis Torso's twisting this way and pelvis twisting this way with the arms sort of mirroring that twist They look really strong and still having good facial expressions great stage presence Good follow-through with this arm. She brought it down slightly and is arcing it all the way through. And this is the last moment where she's starting to bend it in, so she's completed that arc really well. Partly because she used a plie here and then straightened her knee, and so it gives it this sort of down-to-up arc. She also pushed through the ball of this foot to make this knee straight as she came through. Just really amazing control. The stancer has really good control. So what's really cool is that she's kind of pulled her body over on the ball of the foot, which gives it this beautiful, like jazzy vibe as she's bringing this leg around. But at the same time, she's also doing an articulation from the shoulders down to the wrist. So what's happening is she's raising the shoulder up and then she's raising the elbow up and then the hands last. And so it makes this beautiful shape in the air, this pathway in the air. She didn't have to do that necessarily. I mean, maybe the choreographer wanted her to, but it's just adds such a layer of performative quality to what she's doing that it just looks so polished and really lovely. This is a great stillness here for her. She's got a nice crossed over foot right up on the ball of the foot. It looks very intentional. Again, strong arms here. I wish this was a little bit more straight, but good energy out the fingertips. Again, facial expression and stage presence. She's starting this windmill with her arms, one going back and up, the other one going down and up. And I just wish that this would have been a straight elbows. This would have just made this a more dramatic moment, that's all. I love that she's exaggerating her movements. It makes it look very performance quality and is also more impressive. The bigger the movement you can make in the smaller amount of time, the more impressive your performance will be. And specifically for her, she's done a really good job of really rotating her pelvis super far to the right in this movement, so it looks really strong. From this angle, we see these really sharp, you know, sort of backwards V shapes with the legs because she's using the pelvis to rotate. And allowing the knees to really turn as far as they can. And that's partly because she's on the balls of her feet, which are small pivot points, which allow her to do that. She's also balancing that out with some arms here, not the strongest arm here, a little bit weak, but this one looks really strong. She's also got a facial expression to try and connect her with her audience. And she's keeping her torso pretty much facing this way, even though her pelvis is this way. So it creates this really dramatic shape. And it's just a very brief moment, but it makes a very big difference. I would like to have seen her leap a little bit larger into this foot so that as the leg is coming around she would still be in the air. She's doing a good job of keeping a nice straight knee and toes and plantar flexed foot so the toes are really pointed, ankles really pointed so she can draw this nice arc through the sky, through the floor with her leg. Also the arms are really strong and she's doing this pathway, I can't really draw it in three dimensions, but on a horizontal plane she's coming across in this arc with her arms which also looks really nice.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Overall, the dancers need more power and strength throughout the entire dance. I would encourage them to really take the time to drill it and become comfortable with it so they can be overly dramatic in all of their steps. Right now, it feels a little stiff because they look, one, uncomfortable, and two, unsure of the steps. And I know that this is not their intention, and I know that this takes a lot of hard work to be able to do this type of partner choreography. So I think keep working at it and keep practicing will definitely help the overall look and feel of the dance. Again, being very intentional about every little detail of the body will help the overall look and performance quality of this dance. I think they're on the right track and have good bones. Like, they clearly know what it's supposed to be and where they're going, but I think that there's definitely some room for improvement here. Yeah, I repeat some of my previous comments, especially about the pushing and pulling of the wrist so that the partners know where to go and where to move and how to react to each other. By giving a little or getting a little bit of weight, you know where to go in space. I would encourage the dancers to automatically take bigger steps and both be more grounded throughout the entire dance. I think the dancers need to over anticipate this part and take bigger steps so it can feel like they're like really swinging and flying across space. I would encourage the dancers to think about what they're doing when they're not connected. What should their arm always be in place? And also where should their legs be and where should their hips be? Really being clear about the pathway of the arms but also the pattern of the footwork. I would encourage the dancer to have more push and pull in this arm connection here, really engaging the wrists so they know how to react to each other throughout space.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They're able to get a nice mezzo forte volume out without having any kind of a bite on the note and it created a really warm, resonant tone. So that's wonderful playing. In this chord, these last two chords just being played, we hear the very top voice being played with the fifth finger in the right hand speaking just a hair late. This is because the fifth finger in the right hand is just slightly too relaxed. It needs to be slightly more firm so that it goes down with the rest of the hand in the firm handshape that she has in her right hand so that all the notes speak at the same time. The right hand is playing slightly faster than the left hand, so the pianist just needs to slow down that right hand a bit, especially as the notes become higher and they speak faster, the tendency is to start to rush these scales in comparison to the heavier notes in the left hand. So the pianist just needs to slow down and sync the hands back up. The right hand is slightly faster than the left hand right here. This should be the same speed. We can see that even when the pianist is reaching for notes that are either further away or closer to the center of her hand, she's keeping her wrists straight and is not breaking her wrists, and she's extending her fingers and then just stretching the hand out side to side. This is really excellent. This is a great example of how to play a shift, especially a repeating shift in an arpeggio. The pianist should play the left hand notes slightly shorter so that they don't sound longer and overpower the right hand notes. The natural thing that happens with an acoustic instrument is that the lower notes and lower strings as there are strings on the piano ring longer and have less of a clear start on the notes. So you have to overcompensate and play those notes slightly shorter so that they match the notes being played in the right hand in terms of length. This is a wonderful example of phrasing. While the notes are repetitive and it's just a simple arpeggio, the pianist is choosing to swell in volume and taper in volume and it sounds wonderful. So this is a great example of how to make even an exercise interesting. These are perfectly balanced chords, meaning I can hear every note that's being played, and that allows us to really hear this harmony quite well. And the pianist is doing that by keeping a firm handshape and initiating the keystroke by pressing down the arm and not pressing down each finger individually. So this sounds excellent. This is an excellent piano technique. We can see that the shoulders are relaxed. We can see that the wrists aren't broken. It's a pretty straight line from the top of the hand to the top of the arm. We can see that as the pianist is preparing to cross her fingers over her thumb, that she isn't breaking her wrist or side to side or tilting her wrist. She's just gonna cross them this way. There's enough space underneath the hand and above the piano for the fingers to be tucked under. So this is a really excellent piano technique.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Giving himself a great chance at making it every time as long as he can get it close to the white box or even inside the white box. After the make or mislay up, you want to come down on both feet simultaneously for balance and safety purposes. As he's dribbling, he's standing straight up. If he could create a lower center of gravity, which will allow the ball to travel at a shorter distance, he's less likely of getting stripped or a defender coming in trying to steal it. Right here, follow through is kind of low. You want to make sure that follow through is staying consistent and going towards the target. Bringing the ball here, ideally you would want it closer to your body and kind of chest up high. That way once you go up for the layup you can explode up here versus bringing it up from here versus rounding it off. I would say ideally starting this drill up a little bit higher for a better angle, but since the wall is there, I understand why he's starting a little bit low.

This whole kind of last four to eight bars here. They aren't even neither of them are doing the foundational step. They're not doing the same thing as each other. They're totally discoordinated and disconnected, even though they're physically connected. So again, not performance ready. Even in a partner dancing, it's it's fine. Like if you're at a club or whatever, sometimes or even in performance, sometimes you mess up and you're not on the same foot as each other or whatever it might be. But you need to recognize that as quickly as possible. Fix it as quickly as possible. What I'm seeing here is they've been doing the two different things as each other for like at least four bars. And neither of them are either. They're not noticing that that's happening because they're so focused on whatever else they're focused on or they're noticing it, but they don't know how to fix it. Either way, it's like should not be this long of amount of time that they're not doing the same thing, the same step as each other. That's the most foundational concept in partner dancing is doing the same stuff as each other on the beat. Again, weak arm with the opposite arm that's not being held here, just kind of hanging at the side. And they need to work on their clarity, their precision. Whenever that arm is free, it needs to be doing something intentional, not just sort of reacting at the side of the body. There's another really prolonged section where they're holding hands and just sort of walking around each other. They're doing a better job of being on the beat, but again, it's not interesting to watch because there's nothing to really latch onto as a viewer. There's no shape, there's no strength, there's no personality, there's no pizzazz. They really need to work on getting back to basics and get those basics so strong that then they can do any kind of interesting thing on top of that, whether that's a turn or a shimmy or an arm shape or something, and make it look really effective. So she's letting this turn totally fizzle out. Like she starts turning pretty quickly, but then here at the end it's just kind of like, just kind of, yeah, fizzles out. It loses the energy. So just super low energy again. It's just like, you know, it's fine if they're just cruising at home, or just dancing, just enjoying themselves, you know, in their living room, whatever it might be, or even at a club, just dancing, you know, at a swing club or something like that. But this is not a performance. This is just not a performance. It's not interesting. It's very monotone. Okay, this is another example of a leader just kind of going off on their own because they want to be featured in this moment. Well, I can't get into his head. I don't know exactly why he's doing it, but it appears as if it might be like, I want to do this cool thing. But the problem is he didn't communicate that he's doing this cool thing with her. And so they're doing two totally different things, they're on different pages here. And so, yeah, it's not coordinated. They're not connected here. This is better. They're putting a bit more energy and effort into their movements. Still kind of lackadaisical and sluggish. They're both stepping on flat feet, which is not helpful. That means that they're not, dancing on the balls of the feet provides a pivot point that you can move around quickly and also just makes the dancing very light. And this style of dance also has a lightness to it, even when it gets super vibrant and people are doing big old jumps and things like that. There is a lightness to the energy that they're completely missing because they're stepping on flat feet. Also, he very stiffly holds this really deep plie the whole time, which is further adding to the sense of heaviness and clunkiness. It looks like they're trying to do some little improv moment here. Now they're finally getting better at staying on the beat. They're both kind of stepping one, two, one, one, two, one, two here. But again, there's just not enough energy. So and what I mean by that is they're just not exuding energy from the core outwards. So the arms are just very lackadaisical and imprecise. They're not even like looking at each other. There's no emotion coming out of their faces. They're not radiating any sort of emotion except maybe like boredom, especially her. She's just like seems kind of bored. And so that makes it boring to watch. This is not a performance here at all. If they're going to do this little improvisation thing, they need to get precise and clear about what they're trying to do and do it. They need to be stronger with their arms. They need to be more clear about their arm positions. Again, they're both on their flat feet here. This is not a great way to dance. Unless you're being really intentional. This is a couple moments of doing some flat footwork, but they're flat footed the whole time, which shows that they don't even understand some of the most basic foundational concepts of how to do this dance. And so it's really like just not performance ready whatsoever. Again, they're not doing the same step as each other. She's doing a pretty good job of maintaining the one, two, one, two, three, but he's losing it. He keeps losing it. So this is a sign of an inexperienced dancer. It's harder to be the leader sometimes. Sometimes it's harder to be the follower, but one aspect of being a leader that's challenging is that you have to decide what's going to happen and make it happen. And so if you aren't really solid in your body, you don't have a lot of dance experience, you don't know the foundational steps super well. You're not really tied into the music. Anytime that you try to do a move like a turn or something, you're going to lose the rest of it because you can't focus on more than one thing at once. And that's very clearly what's happening here. Similar to, well, I would just prefer that he just stick to the basic step and not try anything fancy until he's absolutely ready for it. He is not ready for it. She is trying something here, so I'm happy to see that she's trying something. Unfortunately, she's not very successful at it. What she's doing is she's leaning this pelvis back and trying to straighten this knee a little bit here. I appreciate that she's finally trying to put some strength into her arms, so I really want to commend her for that, but she clearly doesn't have enough experience in dance or enough awareness of what her body looks like in space or where her body is in space, and so the movement is, the shape is really quite cattywampus, asymmetrical, and does not kind of completely follow through as a shape. Again, very pedestrian here. They're both just walking. And this does sort of look like if I didn't know that this was a dance piece that I'm watching, it might just look like two people walking in opposite directions down the street or at the grocery store. There's not enough oomph and energy. And that's partly because they're stepping on straight feet with flat feet on the ground rather than balls of the, I should say straight knees. At least she is, I can't really see what he's doing, but she's stepping with a straight knee. Both of them are on flat feet here. That's just how we walk. That's not how we dance. It's much better if they had a looser soft knee. She had a soft knee and they were both on the balls of their feet to give them more energy, oomph to zazz, and also a little bit more, a lot more freedom of movement. And also both of them just sort of letting their arm hang at the side and reverberate as they walk. So it looks, it looks very pedestrian. It's not look like a dance performance whatsoever. So, you know, again, there's just not enough energy. They're really not bringing, their energy is so low and it's not just the heaviness of their feet, but it's just the vibe that they're giving, especially the follower. She's just like not exuding any energy out of her core. Here, she's just so lackadaisical, not only just with her arms, but look how her head is just sort of like resting towards the side. It's just like, I don't know, it's just kind of giving us like, I'm bored kind of a vibe. And it's just, nobody wants to watch that. It's not interesting to watch. This is not performance quality whatsoever. He does look like he's trying to do something a little bit here, but again, there's not enough energy out of the fingertips. There's not enough clarity or precision with what he's doing. So it's also giving this lackadaisical vibe. This is a great little turn here, great leadership. He did a really good job of being very clear about what he wanted her to do, and she did a great job of yes, ending him and doing what she wanted him, what he wanted her to do. He placed his hand on her back and switched from holding her right hand with his left hand to switching right to right. And so it's very obvious to her what she's supposed to do. And he's, yeah, he's very clear about it, and she follows what he's asking her to do very well. So good, they're starting here with this rock step and they're stepping on the beat. They're doing the correct foot, so they're stepping, you know, mirroring each other, which is correct technique for partner dancing. The only thing that is bothering me is that their frame is very weak. They're both just kind of laxadaisically holding their arms here. They're not really, they're not holding any strength in either of their frames. And so, yep, just looks very weak. And it's not only that it looks weak, but it also means that whenever he tries to lead her, it's going to take just that much more energy for him to get his arm into the position he needs to get into. And because she's weak, she's not gonna be able to follow very well. It's not she's weak, because her frame is weak. She's not gonna be able to follow very well because her arm will move rather than her whole body. Oh good, yay, they finally did it. So this is a little section where they're traveling this way and they're both doing the same step as each other. Yay. I'm really happy to see that. So that means that on some level, they understand that that's what they're supposed to do. Now, what I would do if I was their teachers is I remember that section right there and I would show them this little section, that feeling there when you felt connected, what did that feel like? Didn't that feel better? Didn't that feel great? Didn't you feel well-coordinated? Didn't you feel strong? I want you to embrace that moment and do that throughout the piece. Very casual again with the arms, very loose, very relaxed. And relaxed isn't even the right word, it's just more weak actually. And so it's not conveying anything, it's not very, it's not any interesting kind of shape, it's imprecise, it's unclear, so it's not performance ready. She's doing a pretty good job of holding the basic foundational step even though she's making her go back and forth here but he's not holding that so again they're not coordinated. It's like there's she's doing this and he's doing this or like bouncing off they're not on the same level as each other meaning like the actual height of their bodies they're just discoordinated. Again, totally discoordinated from each other. They're not even doing the same step as each other. They're not stepping on the beat. You know, this type of dancing really has to be connected to the music in some kind of a way, whether that's even just stepping on the beat, one, two, one, two, one, two, and neither of them are even doing that. So, they're really missing some of the most basic foundational concepts of how to do this type of dance and this choreography. So they're also, they're missing a really important foundational thing, which is to do the basic step. Neither of them are doing that. Neither of them are holding down that basic foundational step, which makes them discoordinated from each other and discoordinated from the music. Another thing about the weak frame here and the way that they're dancing There's just no energy or umph or pizzazz and what they're doing It's just kind of lackadaisical and kind of sluggish even though they're stepping on the beat. It's like not Matching the vibrancy of the music the music is a slower tempo But it's got this sort of like sultry kind of vibe to it and they're just not exuding that they're not matching that whatsoever Part of the reason is because they're not even looking at each other. He's sort of looking off into the distance She's kind of just looking at his chest Straightforward and so they're not really connected in that way either. So there's just not enough energy on pizzazz personality here", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

But having precision throughout their body will increase their musicality and their attempt to stay on the beat. Nice attempt for this dancer to take big steps. I would encourage to improve this movement for them to plie or to bend their legs more, sending their energy down. And then they'll be able to have a greater range of motion to even take bigger, gigantic steps and really cut across space that would improve the quality of an overall look and feel of the dance. This is a nice attempt. I would encourage the dancer to have more effort and energy And really have more attack and hustle throughout the movement to raise the level of proficiency I would encourage this dancer to think about the musicality and rhythm because they're not on the beat. So really taking the time to practice the steps and listen to the music in tandem is really important. And would improve the overall look and feel of this basic choreography. I would encourage the dancer to plie in order to more successfully complete these twists side to side and also to work by pressing down into the balls of their feet. I will also repeat my previous comments about how look how the shoulders are rolled in. Make sure you roll them up back and out and think about really lifting the gaze to exude more confidence but also have more stage and dynamic presence in the movement. This would of course improve the overall look, quality, and feel of the dance. I would encourage the dancer to think about their shoulders. Often their shoulders and their focus is down. I would encourage them to roll their shoulders up, back, and out, so they have a bigger circumference to work from, and their energy from their chest is communicating confidence, and the dynamic quality will be improved by this. And also for their focus to be out as well instead of looking at the floor. I would encourage the dancer to let go of the tension in their fingertips and make sure that their energy doesn't stop at the wrist because we tend to hold tension in our hands when we are either nervous or thinking really hard about choreography.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Their right foot is on a foothold well into the wall outright. I think that their left foot might be pushing on something, starting in this interesting smiley face jug and then maybe the weirdest hold on the wall in this right hand. And so the climber has their right hand on this horn hold. And you see them drift the right foot off that right foot and kind of put most of the weight through this left foot. And I think this is an attempt to free up this left hand and maybe cross through to something. But this right hand just doesn't really give anything back. It's not very ergonomic.

It would really help to slow down and make sure the pitches are heard one at a time or individually and also to make sure that the left hand fingers are pressing firmly in the center of each fret when playing each pitch and not just sliding and slurring the notes together. The guitarist is now playing chords. They are moving up and down the fretboard and they seem very familiar and comfortable with their different chord shapes. Again, here this arpeggio took two attempts to perform successfully. When the guitarist performed this major scale, you could hear the notes more clearly when they descended the scale. Here a few mistakes in pitch are made when descending this scale. It would help to practice this scale at a slower tempo, review the pattern of pitches to gain more accuracy, and even just perform the scale at a slower tempo so each pitch can be heard clearly. The guitarist also made a mistake in pitch here and restarted this scale. They also performed this scale with accurate pitches, but left off the final note in the scale. In this particular scale some of the pitches when ascending the scale were very quiet. It would help to strum a little bit harder here to get a clearer sound quality. Here the descending portion of the scales notes were very jumbled together. It would help to play this scale at a slower tempo so each pitch can be heard clearly. Here the guitarist performed another arpeggio. There was some hesitation when approaching the highest pitch in the arpeggio. The first time they then repeated this pattern and were able to maintain a steady speed when performing it again a second time. This arpeggio pattern needed to be restarted and attempted again as there was some uncertainty with the pitches. It would help to review and practice this pattern multiple times to gain more confidence with the pitches. Again here the guitarist had to restart the first few pitches of their scale. They could use further practice and review of this pattern of pitches to gain more confidence with them. They are demonstrating good left hand position, their left hand fingers are curved, and the thumb is on the back of the neck of the guitar. The guitarist is performing a major scale, their left hand fingers are curved, and they are shifting around easily on the fretboard. They performed this scale holding the note at the end of each octave longer than the rest of the pitches in the scale, which helped them to descend the scale more clearly without rushing. Again, here there was some jumbling of the descending pitches in the scale due to sliding and not playing each pitch individually. It would help to review the first three pitches in this scale, practice them at a slower tempo multiple times, and then get them up to speed to be able to perform this scale as a whole with no mistakes. The guitarist is now performing a different type of arpeggio or broken chord pattern. This time they are only ascending or getting higher in pitch and they are holding the final pitch in each pattern longer than the rest of the pitches. Here the guitarist restarted the beginning of this particular scale multiple times. They seemed uncertain about the pattern of pitches. It would help to review the beginning of this scale further to gain more confidence and be able to play the pattern of pitches on the first try.

As we look on the left side of the frame on our player's release from his right-handed micing layup attempt, we can notice that the player does a decent job of getting his follow-through going towards the direction of the rim, allowing the ball to create the proper spin and rotation it needs to hit our target point, the top right corner of the box on the backboard, allowing the ball to develop the proper angle it needs of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the finished result of the players attempted left-handed micing layup on the left side of the frame due to our players inability to get enough lift off the ground The ball did not gain enough arc and accuracy to get above the rim instead will hit the side of the rim missing short Resulting in an incomplete layup attempt Looking at the player going into his left-handed Mike and Leib attempt on the right frame, some improvements the player needs to make to become more efficient on his attempt is again, starting his body placement position lower in the athletic stance to allow more lift, going into his jumping motion, carrying his body's momentum towards the left side of the rim.

Looking at the release of the players left-handed mic and layup attempt, we can notice that the player did not do a great job of getting his follow through, going towards the direction of the basket, which did not allow the ball to travel directly towards our target area, which is gonna be the top left corner of the box on the backboard. Instead allowing it to travel above the rim with too much power and force, allowing it no opportunity of dropping in the rim, resulting in an incomplete layup attempt.

This the climber will have to generate a lot of pressure when sustaining the hold grip. This is because the climber will forcefully swing out of the wall so it's important that the climber engages on the core the moment that he touches the hold. At this moment his right foot is out for a land so this could potentially compromise the climber when trying to achieve body tension to sustain the swing. Here, the climber is swinging out to the left, slightly to the right, and again swings out to the left forcefully. This because the climber is generating power for when making a powerful stance, which he will need to commit by making a forceful push that will lift him up through the air and for a hot second to bring his right hand to be placed at the hole that is at reach. This is called dyno. So the climber needs to generate a lot of power and his last foot that he will need to rely on the last placement for the push would be the right foot once when reaching a certain distance. However, it's important that the climber brings his chest forward to bring his center of gravity close to the wall. This will help with the reach. Here the climber is starting at a two-hand hold start, both of them being doughnuts. The climber is able to place his hands at the bottom of the doughnut. In order to apply force with the left hand, we can see how he's relying on giving pressure to the grip by leaning back as the fingers are the ones that are placed inside and the thumb is just to keep him in place. But with the right hand, he's creating more force by pinching on the grip with the thumb underneath and it's a more positive hold as it curves in. Now the climber will be able to start the climb once the feet are off the ground. And as we can see, the climber has his right foot placed on a solid hold that sticks out, making it comfortable to make a stance that's supportive. And then the left foot is already placed on a foot chip down below. The climber was able to maintain body tension and avoid having a swing by sending the foot going outwards, giving it more movement to potentially peel off the wall. However, the climber wasn't able to apply sufficient pressure on the grip and as we can see his right hand is already coming off the hold. Now that the climber's grip is off the hold and the climb will land on the mat and the climb is over. Here, the climber was in bringing his center of gravity with him as close as he should have for the wall. This is all engaged on the pull in that he would have to force with his arms. And he said he's at a great distance away from the wall. He was able to transfer his weight over to the highest foot being the right one, reason why we can see all of his body leap at the right direction. Now the climber is sending his right hand up to the hold, hoping to land the hold by keeping an open grip, meaning that the climber will have to palm the hold from above in order to create friction at the hold and will have to create body tension in order to sustain the grip. Here we can see the climber lowering his center of gravity forcefully, keeping his arms extended and disengaging the shoulders. This is so he can be able to drop his weight and transfer the weight over to the feet that are at a higher stance.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

We can hear both notes of the double stop clearly and equally and consistently, so it's an example of an excellent double stop. The violist should have started this on an up bow instead of a down bow because they need to do a large crescendo and where they are on a down bow right now they do not have enough bow left to execute that crescendo. Just a note that the wearer in this video is playing the viola, not the violin, so comments will be made about their viola playing. However, the technique using the viola is extremely similar to that of the violin. We notice that the crescendo ended too soon. Right where she is changing to a down bow right now, should have been the peak of the crescendo, because a crescendo leads into the downbeat that they just played. This is because the violist used too much bow speed too soon and did not properly pace that usage of the bow to meet the needs of a properly paced crescendo. To make this more effective, they should have not sped up so fast and saved more bow for the last half of the crescendo than the first half. That's going to give you the best musical result. This is a little bit too far out to start in the bow, even though this is a pianissimo section. We can see that right at the beginning of just the first note, we're all the way almost at the tip, and that's not giving us quite the tone that we need, especially in this duet scenario where it's just you representing your line. To get the right character, a pianissimo character, but still some tone, so some core tone, you want to be maybe more out about here in the bow, still in the upper third, but somewhere where we can have a little bit more bow speed and a little bit more control so that we can get a little bit of core resonance in there instead of just basically string sound at this point.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This does not allow the ball to gain enough power, momentum, rotation, and accuracy to get above the rim. We will want the player to have her shooting hand underneath the ball, allowing her left hand to be on the side of the ball, having no effect on the release. We also want the player to extend her shooting arm above her shoulder, also having the player jumping on the release, allowing the ball to gain more arc, power, rotation, and accuracy to get above the rim, giving it a better opportunity of dropping inside the rim. The player does a good job as we look at her going into her attempted mid-range jump shot on the right frame. Having her eyes locked in on her target before going into her release, allowing a much easier finish. And also does a decent job of getting her elbow aligned towards the front of the rim to help the ball travel towards the correct alignment it needs. Looking at the release of the player's attempted jump shot on the right side of the frame, some improvements the player can make to become more efficient is to again have a wider base going into her release. This will help the player become more on balance and give the ball a higher chance of gaining power, arc, and accuracy to get above the rim.

Looking at the player going into her mid-range jump shot attempt on the right frame, some improvements the player can make to become more efficient on her attempts is to start her body placement position lower in the athletic stance. This will allow the player to have a quicker release and also more powerful and balanced release allowing the player to widen her stance incorporating the correct footwork either stepping with her left foot first and having her right foot come down second going into her release or the player jumping on two feet allowing herself to be more balanced and controlled going into the release. Looking at the player going into her loading position before going into her release from her attempted mid-range jump shot. Again, we will want the player in the right frame to widen her base to allow more power going into the release. Also allowing the player to be more balanced, allowing the ball to be released accurately, potentially traveling towards the correct target area. Looking at the attempt of the player's mid-range jump shot on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player is pushing the ball with both hands. This does not allow the ball to gain the proper arc rotation and power it needs to stay in the correct alignment traveling above the rim. We will want the player to just have her shooting hand underneath the ball, resting the ball on her fingertips, allowing a slight gap between the ball and the palm, allowing the ball to travel higher, giving it a better opportunity of getting above the rim. Looking at the player going into her mid-range jump shot attempt on the right frame, we can notice some improvements the player can make before going into her attempt. To become more efficient is to incorporate the correct footwork by stepping initially with her left foot first, and having her right foot come down second going into her jump shot. Or the player can jump on two feet, allowing a wider base, a more balanced base, to allow the player to become more fluent going into her release. Looking at the hand placement of the player's attempted mid-range jump shot on the left side of the frame. Again, we would want the player to move her guide hand towards the left side of the ball, having it flat facing the opposite way, allowing a more efficient attempt going into the release, having no effect on the ball after the release, and also aligning the ball properly to stay in the correct alignment traveling towards the target area. Looking at the player going into her attempt on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player does a good job of loading in her legs, squatting down to allow the ball to gain some lift on the release.

However, a slight improvement the player can make as we look on the left side of the frame is getting her guide hand more on the side of the ball, having a flat hand facing the opposite way, allowing the guide hand to be used as just a placeholder, having no effect on the release.

I do like their energy together. I think they work well together and they look like they're actually dancing together and staying on the same rhythm and style of movement together. So here in their stance, really great job interlocking the hands and keeping the arms up high so they're not low, as well as holding each other with the other side of their body. So here she's doing just some runs where her feet kick up to her rear end and she does it well but I think just in the rhythm she really has to hone in on to the music because it's starting to feel a little off so just try her best to stay on top of the music. So here she's kind of stepping out to the side. I think here she can bring her legs in just a little bit just because she's kind of rocking on the inside of her foot so more on her on her arch so she wants to make sure her feet are flat or at least on her toes on the balls of her feet as she walks side to side. I do like that her knees are bent and she's able to really like move into the music and get into it really well. Oh, that was a really nice turnout. They definitely should have stayed connected for the hand, but it was really clean how she had her arms crossed in and then spun her out really well. So in this moment she's adding a bit of just kind of personality to the movements. So she's doing some simple steps and kind of walking around but also really engaging her upper body and swaying side to side as well as using her arms and moving your head side to side as well. So here as she leans back, the lean back looks really great. She is fully arched back around. Her eyes are facing the opposite side of the room. She has her right foot right between right of her calf. I definitely think this foot, she can go up on her toe a bit more. So she's really in a really high releve. He is holding on to her, but it does appear that she's almost losing her balance. So he definitely wants to make sure his hand is at her back to keep her supported while she leans back. So he should also be standing a little bit more straight so he can be secure in holding her. So here she's starting with just a square step. So she steps across and then side and then back into the side. So just pretty much making a square around. I do like that she's kind of over exaggerating the step instead of just keeping the movement small, but she's really stepping out and opening her legs really wide as she steps around. So you can clearly see what the step is. So here was a nice underarm swing around and just when they finally connected, it was really smooth and in place and how they finally came together. So here she's kind of dragging her right leg out with a little heel-toe, so that's where her heel steps out, then her toe, then heel, then toe, while keeping her left foot planted on the floor. So it'd be nice if he also mirrored her movement. I think that would just make them look more like a partner dance.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He took kind of a double step on his right foot, and now he is off the music. So I don't know why he just hesitated, but he should have just kept the music, kept his feet going with the music and he would have been fine, but he took a double step and hesitated. So now he's going to be off the music for the rest of the recording. And I think it's because his body is a little more stiff, and if he would bend his knees more, I think that would help to loosen up his body from the foot on up, because the steps are guided by his feet. So he wants to kind of layer everything from his body. So his knees will then influence his hips, will then influence his chest, and his shoulders, and his head, and it all flows that way. Yeah I think timing really messed this one up. I think it could have been a really nice simple beginner bachata but his timing was off for most of the time so it really messed up the full effect of the dance. Here he does a nice little, um, a different step where he turns his body, he's rotating around to face, um, the camera and then he turns back away from the camera. Um, and he's just taking step, step, step, touch, and then step, step, step, touch, but it really flowed nicely. And I think if he was on the correct beat of the Bachata music, it would have been even better. The dancer is starting with a bachata step and with bachata it is the same beat throughout the entire song. Every bachata song sounds alike so once you get the basics of the step which will make this more of a beginner video it's just easy to kind of stay along with the rhythm because the rhythm is right there. This dancer he's doing the bachata step side by side so step together step touch and then he goes to the other direction going left and right. He is doing the timing correctly so he's doing the correct steps but his body needs to be adjusted where the last step so step together step touch that last touch your hip kind of pops up to the side depending on what leg so on this side his right hip would pop up when he does the last step and that you hear it also in the music so you add you want to make sure the rest of your body is moving along with your feet. So here the music starts to pick up a little bit. It was a nice unexpected thing with the music and his energy also picked up which is really good because he is doing the same steps over and over again so it does get a little monotonous but with the music change he definitely changed his energy as well. I really do like that he made the transition along with the music to turn around and face the other direction. So that was a really good ear to the music knowing, oh, this is a good time to turn around and face the other way. And he did it very seamlessly, really nice, smooth transition. And I notice he's moving his shoulders as well, which is nice, and then kind of lifting his arms up and down, but it's still just the the groove of the bachata step. He's not quite in the pocket, as some would say, of the step.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

They would definitely benefit from practicing this phrase multiple times at a slow tempo, hands separately, to get more comfortable with the pitches in this phrase before attempting it hands together again. The pianist is attempting this phrase again multiple times. They are playing multiple incorrect pitches. It would definitely help to stop and practice this phrase hands separately to gain more pitch accuracy and familiarity with this phrase. Again, here you can see the left hand fingers expanded to cover a wider range of notes. The pianist quickly corrected this mistake in pitch and is playing the correct pitch in key on the piano with their fourth finger. Again, here the pianist is taking a very long pause before beginning their next phrase in the piece. Again, the phrase was reattempted and multiple incorrect pitches were performed. The pianist attempted the first few notes in their phrase hands together again. They are needing to stop and restart this phrase again. It would help to practice at a slower tempo when first attempting hands together to get more comfortable playing the pitches at the same time and aligning the parts rhythmically before attempting it back up to more of a performance speed. The pianist is practicing their right hand part alone. They are going note by note. They just played their first four pitches of the piece and are now thinking through what to play next and looking closely at the sheet music. Here the pianist played an incorrect pitch with their right hand thumb. They again restarted this phrase two more times and now are continuing on slowly with the rest of the phrase. They reattempted this phrase and corrected their mistake in pitch. Here, an incorrect pitch was played by right hand finger number 3. The pianist is now performing this phrase after attempting it about six times just playing the first couple of notes Repeatedly and then hesitating on what to play next The pianist was more successful with their pitch accuracy when attempting this phrase again, but now they are pausing and thinking through what to play next. The pianist is now reviewing the right hand part alone before playing hands together. The pianist is now attempting the right hand part at a much faster tempo. They unfortunately played an incorrect pitch with right hand finger 3. Practicing the right hand part alone is a good practice strategy when first learning the piece so the pianist can master the pattern of pitches and play them with rhythmic accuracy before moving on and attempting the other hand's part. The pianist is now practicing their chords in the next phrase left hand alone.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So here he takes a few extra steps and he finally gets back on the correct beat. So it just when you're on the correct beat for Bacchage, it just makes it all work together a lot nicer and you're just visually and then in the movement because you're on the right beat and just really in the pocket of that music. Yeah, overall, I think this one is a really good beginner. I wouldn't classify this as advanced just because he keeps it really simple, and he's not necessarily using his full body the correct way and just kind of popping that hip on the fourth beat. But he's really good with just transitioning around the space and spinning around. So that's really nice. And it really shows the lightness and just kind of free flowing movement that Bachata is. So I really like how he's just really smooth with his changing of directions. Bachata is very, to me, just a lyrical, fluid style of music. The steps are really simple, so it's just those three steps. One, two, three, touch, step, step, step, touch. So everything is meant to be really simple and relaxed, and I really like how his turns just kind of float around the room when he does them, which is nice. So the dancer starts with the bachata step, stepping side, step, step together. And now he's doing the transition step where he just takes four steps around. He's doing it in a circle in this direction. And then he keeps going around and then this direction. So it's a really nice little flow to kind of get started with the routine. So here's some sound. I think he heard it and he got back on the music correctly. So in his movement just now he was kind of repeating the same steps and I could see this being done with the partner where he's swinging that partner around as he kind of rotates around switching between the transition step and the bachata step so that was really nice and it was nice that he was right on the correct rhythm of the music so it all just flowed really well. So he is off the bachata beat. He's going on the wrong beat. He's doing the correct steps and has a correct number of steps but the rhythm is off so he needs to get back on the correct beat just for bachata because it's very specific of what you're stepping on.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I also feel the climber could jump with two hands as this is a big hold. Definitely able to fit two hands on that. And jumping with this arm as locked out as it is, and you see the hips getting shot straight out as well. This is just going to require a lot more strength than the climber has to reel it back in and the climber falls accordingly. So here we have a start position, these two mini Waco jugs made by Voodoo back in the day. Lower left foot and a higher right foot in a position that is going to allow the climber to pounce out of this position. And so, classic, sort of, dino setup, you know, the climber pull on, pump up, come down, fire out of that. This is very, very common for a dino move.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I don't believe this was choreographed, which shows a sense of artistic liberation and awareness of her own body, which is great. I now challenge her to extend this even further. She's rotating her rib cage in a circle here as her arms are up, and she can rotate her ribs in that circle even further. The circular movement that she's doing with her ribs around and around can be even bigger and exaggerated. The dancers arms are very free. She's dancing very fluidly with her upper body as well Her legs are clearly gliding across the floor As she's making a bit of a box shape as she's coming around So her feet are doing something complicated, but her arms are also Dancing while she's doing all this footwork And if we were to just look at her upper body We wouldn't know that her feet are doing all this movement and I say that to mean that she's remaining very calm While she's dancing like her feet are not throwing her upper body off her upper body is not throwing her legs off She's moving in tandem from head to toe all parts of her body dancing The dancer can add more dynamics into her dance by leaning forward when she comes forward, like with her torso. Or she could also stylize this movement by shimmying or shaking her shoulders in this step so that it's not so monotone, forward-center, back-center, but that she adds extra energy and dynamics on top of the movement. The dancer is very graceful when she's moving and elegant. However, she can have more energy in her arms by extending her arm completely straight outward, especially through her fingertips so that her fingertips complete the line of her arm. The dancer can hit this position here with more energy and striking the position so that her dancing is not monotone and it has ups and downs. Overall she's very fluid, she's very graceful, she's very elegant, but she would benefit from having a few moments of just energy bursting out to create some sort of excitement to watch. The dancer is tapping her toes right and left alternating very lightly with her heel off the ground of whatever foot it is that she's tapping. That is great. She can exaggerate her movement now more here by moving her hips more in this movement and bending her knees to allow her hips to move freely and just overall having more energy and making her movement more dynamic. The dancer does a really good job here of lengthening her arms far upward so that they are consolidated close when she turns, but are not scrunched down towards her head. She still is elongated and has a length to her while she's turning. The dancer is looking to her right each time she extends her right arm out, but she doesn't also look to her left each time that she extends her left arm out. So this should be consistent. If she's going to look to her right when she extends her right arm out, she also should be looking to her left when she extends her left arm outward. The dancer made a small mistake here stepping forward with the wrong foot but she quickly corrects this mistake and gets back on rhythm and gets back on the correct foot that she was meant to be on which is a great way of just picking up where you left off and figuring it out. The mistake is not blaring, it's not apparent and she doesn't look anywhere else in the room which basically helps hide the mistake so that it's very short-lived especially because she remains focused so if we're looking at her face and her eyes we don't really see that she made a mistake we might not have even noticed. The dancer had a really great spot with her eyes. She began looking forward, straight ahead, and as she completed that revolution or that turnaround, she also continued to spot forward. That way she was able to start and end the turn very neatly, always looking at the exact spot on the curtain and what she wanted to end up. And so she never got disoriented and was able to complete the turn very neatly. The dancer is in perfect rhythm going forward one two coming back to the center and three Holding count four going backwards five six coming back to the center on seven holding count eight She's also doing this on her toes the whole time as we see her heels are lifted off the ground And that is why she's able to be so mobile so easily The dancer is very light on her feet. Her weight is shifted towards her toes and her heels are off the ground, which is great.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I think her rhythm is a little bit off here when she does the clap and the snap. So really like trying to find the groove of the music will help with the overall look and feel of the dance. I think she could have been her knees a little bit more again in this upper body, just not make it so stiff. So try to get a little more fluidity and movement in your body. So here the dancer is doing just a step and touching back. So right now she's stepping on her left foot and then touching back with her right foot. Again I would say maybe add some upper body a little bit, maybe swaying those arms side to side. Right now her upper body is just really, really stiff so you want to get a little more movement in that. And because your feet are moving, that can naturally push your upper body to move as well even if you don't have exact arm movements to do. Just think about the flow of your body in that step. So here I think the dancer had some good moments and there were some times where she was definitely on the timing, but then there were also some times where she was not and the movements were just not done full out. So I definitely suggest bending those knees, using the full body, the upper body has to move, try to move the back, change directions, just to really add some additional elements to the dance and make it much easier for a learner to learn. So definitely counting and really listening to the music and trying to hone into the different rhythms and beats and accents of the music. So here the dancer kind of has a little dance break where she's rocking back and forth. Again, I think this could have been a bigger rock back and forth. Really make it, just make it really secure and stand out in what you're doing. So it doesn't look like you're not sure, but be really sure of your movements. And I think if she would have done that, then when she steps over to the side and does the rock again, it would have made more sense. Right now, I couldn't really tell if she meant to do it or not. So you really just have to go all the way and do the steps full out. So here the dancer starts with just stepping out and sliding her foot in. The slide happens where her foot stays flat on the floor and drags into her body. She does a good job staying on the timing with the beginning. I would definitely recommend doing a little bit more movement in the upper body because it's very stiff at this time. So here she's doing a little twist. She first did a twist out and in with both of her feet at the same time and then she did a twist with her heels going side to side. I think really just making that a bit bigger and using the whole body so if the knees are facing this way on the twist and the upper body should be facing the opposite direction so the twist is happening in the core of the body. So here the dancer is doing a little Charleston variation step where she's kicking forward and stepping back and ball change. I think at this point she would benefit from counting because right now it's not really consistent. Her kicks and her steps, the Charleston is very a step, kick, step, touch, step, kick, step, touch, and she's adding a few steps in there and I think if she counted then she would be on the correct steps and the correct timing of the music. So here the dancer is doing a little rock with her hips, rocking back and forth on her legs. As you see her left leg, the toe is up and her right foot is flat on the floor. The knees are slightly bent. I would definitely say she could have pushed her hips a little bit more out just to really accent the music of the trumpets playing and then taking those nice steps to the side which she did well and then rocking the hips. So just making those hip movements a little bit larger could have elevated the step.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Again, that ball, see how the ball's kind of behind her hand? So that tells me on its way up it kind of became unstable and maybe moved a little bit, which throws off the accuracy. I think here's her guide hand. There's a pretty, I love how she extended the right elbow. That's good. And she's got a little lift here. Does she have the right angle here? It may hit a little bit of the rim here. Again, a lot of the push-off is on that right foot and leg. We want it to be on the left foot. Much better job of extending the arm and getting the ball. Looks like it's a little bit more out in front of that hand. There's that wrist that snaps it down. Here's our guide arm. She's got does a good job of keeping that up there. Again, she squares her body by going off two feet. This is not bad here. See the ball coming off the fingertips here. Here's her guide hand. Looks like she's a little bit square to the to the backboard. Again, she pivots here a little bit too soon. The footwork really isn't what ideal for what we need for the layup, for the right hand layup. We need to land on this left and really pull that right knee up. Here she kind of dips down, see how her dip that right elbow and shoulder. She does have the guide hand up, which is really nice to see as she raises the ball. It starts to come off. Again, I don't know if the angle is there to use the top of that square on the backboard. She's taking teeny little steps. She could take one big step here with the left foot and use it to help pivot and square her body. She kind of shuffles her feet a little bit, in some cases maybe even traveling, but I love how she moves with two hands on the ball. She uses that shooting hand there on the one side, the left hand on the side, and her eyes and head are up. So she's kind of stops. You know, ideally we'd love to her to plant this left foot and really push off and pull the right knee up. She's choosing to kind of go off two feet, but again it's it's she doesn't really have that sharp angle that you need. It's a little bit too straight on, therefore she can't really use that top of that square. Again, not the ideal footwork for explosiveness and lift, but she does gather both feet. Here the guide hand comes off, her shooting hands behind the ball. Looks like a little better angle here to use the backboard. Here she's starting on the left side. She took a dribble. See how she looks down at the ball. So again, you know, ball handling dribble moves are so important and being able to to look up, look for a teammate, look at the rim without looking at it. That's a skill within itself. Here, it may even hit rim a little bit. There's just really not a lot of room for error here. Again, I like she's trying to get up off the ground off two feet. Good extension here of the hips. Here the shooter shooting a right-hand reverse layup. She's taking the ball up with just one hand. I'd love to see the the second hand a little bit on the ball a little bit longer, but you know she's got it sitting back here which is good. I see the guide hand though, the guide arm is up there. I think she would you know see how she's kind of like flat here like we got to get a little better spacing here and angle where she could use the top of that square. Here we're just a little straight on we need to be more at a 45 degree angle to use that. Here's our target. It's tough that's a tough angle right there to finish. Again, chooses to go off two feet with a lot of the weight here on the right foot though. Again, at the end of the day, it's okay when you're learning. Again, that ball's a little behind her follow-through. We want it to be out ahead of that hand. She's got really good extension of the hips here. That's good to see, and that arm bar is up there. See the ball kind of coming back off the fingertips? Somewhere in there, she lost a little bit of the control. We want that ball out in front of that hand, high on the backboard. Again, a lot of her weight here on the right foot. Ideally, we want to go off the left foot and really pull that right knee up, so she would benefit from just working on a simple layup, maybe with the footwork, with a one-step movement. Here, it looks like it's got a better chance of hitting the top of that square. Good extension and reach here. Arm bars up, but again, all that weight on that right leg. We want it to be on the left foot. Again, takes a little hop here, lands on two feet. You know, at the end of the day there's nothing wrong with going off two feet. It's a little quicker and more explosive if you would really get timing and push off that left foot. But here she's eyeing our target. Again, not really sure of the angle, the spacing that she needs to use the top of that square. And you know, and sometimes the ball just coming out of that right hand doesn't have a lot of control. So therefore the ball's hitting really high on the backboard here. And her follow-through is across her body. We'd like it to be more straight on. And then continued work here on the footwork. Here she, her footwork, you know, she would benefit from really working on the footwork to shoot. Sometimes you could just take one step or two steps to shoot the layup or use a dribble. I think the dribble for her would come later. But here she's, you know, she's taking the steps she needs to get there. She may be planning this left foot a little bit too soon to get the proper angle. I love that her eyes are up. She's got two hands on the ball as she moves left to right.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

They can keep their hands on the keys and hold them down a little bit longer, just not to bring them up abruptly. Again, the pianist is using a lot of extra motion with their fingers and also in their wrists to be playing this fast. It'd be best for them just to make sure that they keep things as close to the keyboard as possible to be more efficient. This is really essential if you're wanting to play faster speeds. The pianist is trying to play this next piece but doesn't know all the notes. They should just make sure that they practice this enough and also listen to some recordings to hear how it's supposed to sound and also do some score studying so they know what the notes are on the page. The right hand, they're kind of slapping around just at different keys, and especially with the handshake that they have with longer fingers, they have more of a risk of hitting the wrong notes. This could be held a little bit closer to the keyboard and use more of their natural arm weight to get the power and articulation that they're wanting. This part in the left hand is starting to rush quite a bit too. They need to make sure that they find an ideal tempo speed and then practice that tempo with a metronome. There's some extra noise when they are playing on the keys because their fingernails are long. They should try to trim them so they have contact with just the flesh of the finger. Again, the pianist is playing at way too fast of a tempo for themselves and also with their technique. They should also just try to play with a metronome but isolate the hands so that they have a good idea that when they bring them together they can have more coordination. The pianist is now playing this faster than they were before, which is just resulting in them eventually making a mistake very quickly. The balance between the two hands could be improved. The left hand is sounding really busy. It can start off that way at first, but then when the right hand is introduced, it should try to become a little bit more in the background, so that the right hand should be more emphasized. The tempo starts to rush a lot during this section. They should just make sure that they try to play with the metronome very slowly, and then build up the tempo very slightly to the performance tempo that they want to take. They're clearly lost, they're not sure which notes to be playing next. Again, for how fast they're playing, they're making a lot of mistakes. The tempo should be much slower, and if it's slower and inaccurate, it will come across as being virtuosic, but this is way too fast. When playing this descending line with the left hand, their fingers are flying up pretty high, especially for being to play fast. For them to play more efficiently, they should try to keep the fingers as close as possible to the keyboard and to play more with their fingertips. Again, the pianist is trying to find the notes of the song that they're wanting to play. They should just make sure that they isolate one hand at a time to figure out which notes that they're trying to play. They also need to just practice more frequently so they become more acclimated to playing the piano in general. If the pianist is unfamiliar with this section, if they're trying to grasp on what notes to be playing next, they should make sure that they practice this section more frequently and with a lot of good repetition so they are aware of where their fingers are supposed to go. The pianist is trying to make sure that they're playing the right notes. With how fast that they're taking this tempo, it's hard for them to be very consistent without any sort of micro-stops. This is a sign that they're playing way too fast. They should be able to pick a tempo that they can play without stopping. When having a lot of movement and shifts to make and extensions to make with the left hand, they slow down their tempo considerably to be able to make it. This is a good sign that their tempo that they're taking is way too fast. They should slow it down so that everything across the board is very fluid. The pianist is using a lot of extra motion in their wrists as they're doing this descending motion down the keyboard to try to help pivot their hands so they can use their fingers more. But they're also keeping their fingers really high off the keyboard. This is not an efficient movement and is resulting in a lot of mistakes for them. If they're trying to play at a faster tempo, they should try to keep their hands closer to the keyboard and just think about moving their arms to help guide their hands.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And same thing with when he crosses over and steps out to the side, really trying to push that hip out to the side as he steps out, and just to help with the flow of his full body. So the dancer starts taking steps in place. He is essentially doing this step correctly with the right timing and he's circling his arms around but I do think he's a bit stiff in like his chest area so you really want to loosen all of that up so your arms are not doing such hard work. All right, really good job on the turns. He was able to spot and make it all the way around, keeping his balance and then landing front and center. So here when he's stepping forward and back, his feet are a little flat so it definitely draws the energy down a bit so I would recommend dancing a bit more on the toes so it's a little bit lighter but good job keeping the knees bent just make sure you're not stepping flat on the floor. And when he steps out to the side, again using his hips a little bit more, that would definitely help to loosen up the rest of his body. So as he steps out, really pushing that hip out along with his leg just to kind of separate his hip from his waist and give a little more fluid movement in the body.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Once his cucumbers and tomatoes are all combined, he begins to season his recipe first with kosher salt freshly ground. As I mentioned previously, I would always recommend using a measuring spoon when you're seasoning a salad so that you know exactly how much you are adding. It's very easy to under or over season when you are not using a measuring spoon. And laying the two cucumber halves side by side, he proceeds to cut these cucumber halves in thin slices on the diagonal. This is called a bias cut and it is obviously, he is very comfortable with this knife. He has excellent knife skills even to know how to do this or perform this part of the task. He cuts the cucumber in half crosswise to create two three-inch pieces and then he proceeds to peel the first piece with a vegetable peeler directly into the sink below. He also seasons with freshly ground black pepper and the measuring spoon still applies. Here you can see that he is cutting his cherry tomatoes in half lengthwise and immediately transferring them to the bowl. I believe that he could transfer these as a bundle once they are cut, but for whatever reason part of his methodology is cutting them and transferring them immediately. He repeats this entire method with the second half of the cucumber including peeling it into the sink, cutting it in half lengthwise, and cutting the two halves on the bias into thin slices. The first step in making a cucumber and tomato salad is to prepare your ingredients and gather all of your tools that you will need. You can see here that he has a chef's knife or this machete, a wooden cutting board, and a mixing bowl. And here he has a traditional cucumber. His final step before serving is to toss all of the ingredients together, which he is doing here with a set of chopsticks. He could also use a spoon or a fork as well. When the cucumber is fully cut, you can see that he uses his left hand to bundle up the vegetables and with his knife in his right hand he scoops them up. This is again an expert level way of transitioning the cut vegetables into your mixing bowl and not something that a regular home cook would typically do. Once the cucumber is fully peeled, he slices that piece in half lengthwise. He cuts both of the ends off about a fourth of an inch and immediately puts them into this garbage bag here.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The dancer is also opening her chest here, her rib cage, so we see that there's a curve in her spine, and that's also showing a misalignment of her spine. She also curves and flattens her spine here so that it is folded and so in turn she could fold her body completely. One thing that is helping her shift is that she's looking downward. Her eye focus helps her whole body get downward. As you can see, she sees her feet because her eyes are focused downward. The dancer does a good job of shifting her levels here from being very high to very low. She makes this shift very well. The dancer's knees are a bit bent here while she's turning, which she should not be doing. Her knees should not be bent here. The dancer's arms and shoulders are also too far behind her. Her elbows are behind her head, so she needs to move her arms forward a bit so that they're at the side of her ears instead of behind her head. Instead, she needs to move her ribs backwards so that her spine is in a vertical line. Instead, when she's turning, both of her legs should be in a straight line and not angled because there's a bend.

It does show the stress of competition and how indecision can affect a climber.

So the front knees are bent nicely and just a nice upper body shake in the shimmy and everything else. So really nice job so far.

A lot of that liquid had evaporated off in the process. and some freshly ground black pepper. It's really layering its flavors in. The salt is the brightener. The pepper is an earthy tone with a little bit of bite. And now he's stirring his mixture around. Here he's cutting his grape tomatoes in half. And using a spatula, he's breaking up the eggs. Since I've never seen a mixture with this much liquid in it, I'm curious to see how it turns out, but his eggs look great so far. Now he's adding some salt. He's got a salt grinder. He's adding that to his eggs. Making another swirl as the pans heated up the oil it's going to be a little less viscous You'll be able to get it more evenly coated on the base Here he has a can of tomato sauce that he's adding some of to his or pureed tomatoes either way that he's adding into his mixture. Continuing to press on those tomatoes. He's taking two eggs and a can of something from the refrigerator. and the skin just comes right off now. His fingers are in good position, his knuckles are out, his fingertips are tucked, he's pressing on that to keep it steady and he's cutting very efficiently through that. Throws that away. perfect. They just look wonderful. They're creamy and not overcooked. Now he's got his garlic cloves together. He's using this left hand to anchor the tip of his knife on the cutting board, while his right hand is doing all the work, going up and down over the three cloves of garlic to cut them down. Here he's slapped the side of that knife onto the garlic and that is a great way to remove that excess Kind of last bits of that white paper, which are the hardest because they are stuck right to it that kind of breaks that that Skin off and allows it to come off. It also releases oils in the garlic. So it makes it a more Pungent flavor, which is a nice addition I would not recommend eating off the floor. Here he's added his egg mixture to his pan. I would have liked for him to have done a quick whisk again on those just to make sure that the salt hadn't fallen to the base of the dish. And now he's adding his tomatoes. He's doing a good job of stirring and incorporating those eggs evenly through the tomato mixture, which is what you want. This is a comfort food dish. It's intended to be warming and cozy and everything together in every bite. And swirling the pan, he's able to spread the oil around the base of the pan to evenly coat. Now he's adding some salt to the tomato mixture. Now he's adding a little oil to the pan. and he's placing them in a bowl to the right of the stove. Getting this white off of the outside of garlic is very challenging. And he's whisking his eggs with a set of chopsticks, a fork or a whisk would also do this. Whisking is a great way to incorporate the yolk and the white, add in the salt, make sure everything's evenly distributed, but it also incorporates air into the mixture if it's done properly from a bottom to top circular motion. That allows for a fluffy egg mixture. And that's what you want. Here he's using a spatula to press on the tomatoes. He wants his tomatoes to be very soft and mashing them is gonna help them get that soft texture, cook through more quickly. Using the same pan, he's moved his onion and garlic to the pan. Now he's adding his eggs back in. So he has a green onion, one stalk of green onion, and he's got what looks to be almost like a cleaver for his knife, a little robust, but it's gonna do the trick. breaking his eggs on his countertop corner, he's adding them to the bowl. His knife does look nice and sharp. probably a good way for him to get enhanced tomato flavor, especially when he's in off season where tomatoes may not be great or with these smaller tomatoes, they're not gonna put off as much that rich tomato flavor. For this dish you want creamy eggs and not really highly cooked eggs because they're going to return to the pan later. So he has just added them and they are cooking rather quickly which is good because he's moving them a lot. Now he's preparing some garlic by removing them from their head. He's got a nonstick skillet here that he's placed over the heat on it on a gas stove. He's lit the gas stove under the skillet Here he's adding some water to his mixture. I've never actually seen someone do this, but I can see that he's probably utilizing the heat to steam his mixture. And now he's making cross cuts to make little rounds of his green onion, the green part. Here he's got his egg mixture cooking a little bit in the pan and he's starting to swirl that pulling in on the mixture with his chopsticks. This is the exact right technique, bring it in and utilizing extra space for uncooked egg to seep into and therefore continue cooking. I will say that I do not agree with putting a can, an opened can, even covered into the refrigerator. He should be putting this in another container and then putting it into the refrigerator, most likely a glass container with a fitting lid. He cuts the root end off of the green onion. He's got a little tomato, onion, garlic soup here, but he's still pressing on his tomatoes to activate them and get them to soften up.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They could have stood into it and kind of twisted in and then kind of like a dynamic kind of twist move on driving through his feet to then static the move up to the right. And so we can see him kind of readjusting and trying to get to the undercling portion.

The details of their hands moving, of where their feet should be, of how their head cuts through space, of where their hips should be. All of those things create a successful intermediate salsa and take you from novice to professional. So I would encourage the dancer to think about all of those details that feel miniscule but make all the difference. I would encourage them again here to really plie deep so we can see this winding of the hips. I would encourage the dancer to begin the step being more grounded so we can really see the turn and twist of these knees here. And we can also see the clear articulation and the lengthening of the leg from the hip flexor all the way down to the pointed of the toe. I would encourage them to think about their arms because they tend to move one arm more than the other. So making sure they have an equal distribution of the arms and that the arm is moving as a reaction to the torso and the ribcage moving. the dancer be kind of begins to use their hips and then kind of cuts it off. So in order to encourage hip articulation throughout the entire dance, I would encourage them to be more grounded and figure out how connecting their hips to their torso and connecting their hips to their feet so it all moves as one unit can create more fluidity in the salsa step.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

As you can see, he started shooting here and landed here. You do not want to fall back after you touch the ground with your jump shot. As you jump, you want to kind of land in the same spot versus fade back. That's going to take away from your shot. So just be able to elevate, come up, come down, pretty much land where you jump from. Great mechanic that you can see he's focusing on the middle and pointed finger. The left hand is straight, no support with his left arm. That's great mechanics for a jump shot. Right here, fatigue will determine the inconsistencies on his shot. There's no flexion in his knees. Now remember, if there's no flexion in your knees when you get tired, you're going to start pushing the ball more. So right here, you want to be able to get more flexion in your knees to be able to balance out the jump shot using your arms and using your knees at the same time. Right here is great placement right before the jump shot. There is a window here where you can see the basket versus the ball being in your vision to block the basket or to block your vision from seeing anything else. So this is actually great vision.

This should be played louder. This is the melody here. A little bit closer to the bridge. And also flatter hair. We can see that the violist is playing completely on the side of the hair here. So she needs to rotate the bow back toward her and get a little more hair on it. That's also going to increase the volume. On those last three bow strokes, we just need a little bit more articulation. It was a little too brushy for the intensity of the music here. So a really quick resetting of the weight in the bow, catching the string, and having a clear start, an immediacy of tone, and a little bit of a bite on it will help add to the intensity. And that's executed by keeping that weight in the first finger, quickly pulling it out and putting it back in. We need a little bit more clarity and volume out of this harmonic, so playing a little bit closer to the bridge is going to make that harmonic speak better. The pressure is good in the left hand, holding it down, but just need to get closer to the bridge because that makes harmonics speak more clearly. In these last two phrases here, we need to make sure that we are crescendoing to the next phrase and then decrescendoing on the long held downbeat notes. So on the moving notes, we want to crescendo to the long note and then decrescendo on the long note. We're hearing a lot of fuzz at the beginning of each of these staccato notes. This spiccato bow stroke the violist is playing. And so we need to make sure just a little bit closer to the string with each of these bounces so that we're not coming down as hard and as inaccurately as she is now. So if you can really make sure to quickly find a good contact point between all these fast bow strokes that will eliminate the fuzz here. We need much more intensity in the vibrato here. The rado is both too slow and too narrow There's a little bit of tension in the hand. So loosen that up will help but we need a slightly narrower than normal and fast vibrato to really energize These notes here and add to the intensity of this piece We need more horizontal motion in these short bow strokes that the violist is doing because we're not getting enough pitch. So same note length in terms of how long the note speaks, but more horizontal motion so that when it speaks we hear pitch. What we just heard in this spiccato bow stroke, but with a double string crossing, was that all of a sudden the note envelope of these pecky short notes, which were correct, turned into longer and slightly slower notes. So I need to make sure that even though it's more difficult to bounce the bow and do a double string crossing, that we're not using too much bow or using the same articulation so it doesn't disrupt the line there. This is a very nice, very delicate piano spiccato bow stroke here. It's well done. The violist needs to make sure that they're rotating on this string crossing far enough to the E string side so that we get enough weight on that E string for it to speak. Also a little bit more length on that E string compared to the string that it's coming from, a lower string, because that higher, thinner string needs more bow to make the same resonance. This is just a note that the instrument being played in this video is a viola, not a violin, so all comments will be directed toward the viola. However, the technique of a viola is similar to a violin, and comments will also be made just regarding general string technique. This is a really well executed down bow ricochet and the timing with the left hand is great too. We can hear every note clearly and they're consistent. So it's a great down bow ricochet. We have a complete loss of discernible pitch here, because the violist does not know these notes well enough and is not firmly holding down a note and is also playing really light with the bow. So some slow practice with this, even though it's gonna be in a piano dynamic, we really need to have a clear left hand so we can hear these pitches. We need much more power and volume on this strum here. We need a firmer finger to achieve this. The violist's finger right now is a little too loose to really pull against the elasticity of the string, and we need just a harder motion. Firmer finger, harder motion, get a louder strum, and that'll be musically appropriate. We need a much wider vibrato here. This is a very vocal melody and it has to contrast the intensity of the music that came before it. So a very wide vocal vibrato here. Really excellent tone here and really excellent job getting both the double stop notes to speak. This is all due to great bow placement. Because she is playing near the bridge, we're getting a really powerful direct sound which is musically needed and because she's keeping her bow on this flat plane, she's consistently pulling vibration on both of those strings. So it's very well done.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

You can tell he really starts to get fatigued. He falls off the rhythm quite significantly and really stops incorporating the arms to any significant degree. It would benefit him to take smaller movements, smaller kicks, smaller jumps, and incorporate his arms more fully so he can use his entire body to not only connect to the rhythm but also to keep him from getting fatigued. As the dancer performs these chugs backwards in space, alternating with the clapping of his hands, you're able to hear that he's audibly connecting to the rhythm and he gets more of the rhythmic embodiment that he's been lacking thus far. What's helping here is this bend in his knees and the dropping back of the pelvis, which is grounding him and connecting him to the floor, and also keeping the movements of the arms tight and small close to his torso. As the dancer begins with a series of small kicks, kicking his legs out from underneath him in an alternating pattern, he right off the bat struggles to connect to the rhythm. It's quite a quick tempo in this music, and he's really struggling to keep up with the tempo while maintaining a full embodiment of the movement. If he were to bend his knees a little bit more and keep his movements smaller and more tightly underneath him, and also get control of his pelvis and engage his arms, he would have more stability and ability to move quickly to keep up with the tempo and the rhythm of the music. As the dancer continues to perform a series of kicks that continue to get bigger and bigger and make him change facings throughout the room, he really starts to lose any sort of specificity in his movements. He kind of flicks his legs outwards performing the kick, while holding his arms very loosely by his sides, he has a bouncing quality to his movement, which is really disconnecting him from the rhythm and keeping him from being able to move quickly and efficiently. As the dancer performs his alternating lunging kick with a clap in front of him from corner to corner, moving from one side of the room to the other, he struggles to perform this kind of larger movement that travels across the space and keep up with the tempo of the music. He really disconnects from any rhythmic embodiment he had had thus far and struggles to keep up with the tempo and the music while performing this bigger step. It would help him here to move quickly and make his steps a lot smaller to minimize the amount of movement he needs to do in a short time period. As the dancer transitions into this kind of train movement or train motion with his arms alternating kind of a circular pattern and him chugging his foot out in front of him alternating sides, he struggles to transition from the quickness of the kicks prior to this into the more grounded movement here. He struggles to connect to the rhythm quite significantly.

Looking at the player going into her right-handed reverse layup attempt to help the player become more efficient looking on the right frame is having the player jump off her left foot going into the rim or jumping off two feet at the same time in a wider stance allowing the player more balance and power helping her body's momentum carry her forward closer towards the rim giving the ball better opportunity of traveling towards our target area and dropping inside the rim Looking at the release of the player's right-handed reverse layup attempt, some improvements the player can make to become more efficient is getting her shoulders squared towards the back of the rim before and after the release, allowing a better angle for the ball to travel directly towards our target area, giving it the proper force of softly dropping inside the rim. Looking at the release of the player's right-handed reverse layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice that the player does better on her attempt, getting her shoulders squared towards the back of the rim, allowing a better angle for the ball to travel more accurately, as we see in the right frame, towards our target area, the top right corner of the box on the backboard, helping it develop a better angle of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the finished result from the player's right-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice on both frames the player did not provide enough arc power and accuracy to get the ball to hit our target point, giving it a proper angle dropping it aside, however will bounce off the front of the rim, resulting in an incomplete layup attempt. Looking at the player going into her right-handed reverse layup attempt, an improvement to help the player become more efficient is getting her shoulders squared towards the back of the rim before going into the release and on the release, allowing a better angle for the ball to travel again directly towards our target area, allowing it a much better opportunity dropping inside the rim. Looking at the player going into her right-handed reverse layup attempt on the right frame, an improvement that helped the player is getting her body placement position low in the athletic stance, allowing her attempt to become quicker, more balanced, and more explosive, allowing the ball to travel at a closer distance, being closer to the rim, hitting our target point, and potentially dropping inside the rim. Looking at the player going into her right-handed reverse layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice that the player does do well jumping with full maximum effort, allowing her body's momentum to carry her forward towards the rim. However, we want the player to jump at a better angle, going towards the rim, giving the ball a better opportunity, and giving it a better angle of traveling, hitting our target point, and ultimately helping it develop the angle it needs dropping inside the rim. As a result from our players right-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice that the player did not provide enough power, rotation, and accuracy to get the ball to travel towards our target point. Instead, bounces off the top of the rim, resulting in the incomplete layup attempt. Looking at the angle of the player going into her right-handed reverse layup attempt, an improvement that helped the player become more efficient is jumping off at a better angle with her left leg, going forward closer towards the rim. This will allow the ball to have a better opportunity of traveling above the rim, going towards her target point, and potentially dropping inside.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

When the personality shines through, it just adds that extra layer of performance. This is why dance is not a sport, because it's not just about doing the mechanics of the step. It's about putting a piece of yourself on that dance floor. And that really helps to engage the audience and makes it much more interesting to watch. She's sort of changed her facial expression here into this more slightly sassier expression by curling her lips inward in a way, and her slight change in the posture of her chin here. It's very, very subtle, but it really adds to this feeling of sassiness with this step. She's also doing a little bit of a shimmy here through the shoulders and a little bit of movement through the pelvis, which is adding to this sassy feeling. The arm here is also really quite specific. And looks really intentional. Only thing I might say here is if she is bringing this foot teensy bit further forward, it would emphasize the counterbalance with this arm even more. But other than that, this is really a lovely moment. The dancer has attempted to spot her head. I would just encourage her to see if she can continue looking over the shoulder a little bit longer to help prevent dizziness. Also, by this point in the turn, to make it a little bit faster I would recommend she bring the arm in a little bit more and might think about being on the balls of the feet to keep the turn nice and crisp. Again, the reason this dancer isn't getting a 10 for this run through here is these arms are not very specific. So her arms have been super strong, consistent, and specific this whole time. But as she's ending this turn, one of them has come onto the hip and the other one is in a different orientation here. And this just makes the turn end a little bit awkwardly. Another example of dancing through a transition. So here she's put her weight onto this right foot and is pushing forward with this arm, which is obvious that she's about to do something different than she was just doing, but she's still dancing through it. She still has a smile on her face. She still has a clear, confident gaze forward. She's making a strong shape with this arm. It doesn't look pedestrian at all. She's preparing for the next thing she's about to do, but in a quote unquote dancy way. Here the dancer again really seems to understand the intention of the step. So this step is bringing her forward and back here and you can see that as she is stepping in the process of stepping the left leg forward the right hip is going back and she's achieving that with a because of the pretty straight knee here which is bringing the hip up and back and another thing about this is that it looks super intentional because she's doing it on both sides. She's doing this pelvic rotation on both sides and again you know salsa dance in general is a lot about the movement through the hips and pelvis and she really seems to understand that but she's also not disregarding or dropping the arm movements. The arms are still super strong they're held away from the body which makes them look super strong and intentional. The shapes are really strong as well and she's alternating the up and down with the arms without missing a beat. Again beautiful open sternum and chest, smile on the face, confident gaze forward, great posture. Here again we can see that the dancer really understands the coordination with her whole body but particularly understands that the point of this step and the prior step is really to showcase the pelvis moving side to side, swaying side to side. And you can see that because her torso is here but then there's an arc this way right about here and that's because this hip is coming up and to her side as she's bringing the same leg out. And that's excellent technique again really shows that she understands this step. Part of how she's achieving that is by having her knee not fully straight but more straight than the other leg and slightly straightening through that knee will help to push that hip upwards and keeping a plie with this leg is also helping. The arms, she did lose a little bit of the arm strength here with that left arm kind of being lackadaisical in this moment but other than that the arms are looking well coordinated with the feet. And they recommend trying to be on the ball of her foot here because that could help emphasize the hips movement even more. Great to confidence again through the sternum and the posture, the gaze and the smile on her face. What she's done really well in this moment is she had her weight on this right leg and she brought the left leg out and now has just brought it back in again for this step. And as she brought this left leg back in, she very gently rolled down the foot from the ball of the foot towards the heel in a way that really demonstrates excellent control and also helped her to take up the whole music there. Rather than just bringing it back in quickly and waiting for the rest of the music to catch up with her, she kind of took up that whole phrase. But even more importantly, rolling down has created a really nice lovely cushion which that control demonstrates excellent technique and just looks really nice and smooth and the smoothness really fits with this style of dance. Again, great confidence through the sternum, the posture through the spine, the gaze forward, and the smile on her face as well as the arms are staying really consistent here even though she was doing a step with her feet close together and now she's done one where the feet go out and back in. She's kept the arms really consistent which is again a demonstration of great technique. I might consider recommending that she have a slightly wider base here rather than bringing the feet really close together but in her case it doesn't seem to be hindering her controller coordination. So here again, the dancer is in a transition moment, and this is a really great example of dancing through a transition. I can tell this is a transition because she repeated the previous step four times, and that's kind of what's so far been the theme or the structure of this choreography. So, and also she's doing the steps slightly differently than the previous one. The previous one was bringing her back in front. She was never in this position before with the feet. But I will say that, again, this is a really good example of dancing through the transition because she has not let go of the arm movement. It's consistently doing the same thing over and over again, despite the fact that she's changing steps. And she's kept the energy alive through the legs. She isn't relaxed through here or standing in a pedestrian sort of way. She's very intentionally doing a touch with the ball of the foot and keeping this knee bent so that she can prepare for the next step, but it doesn't look like she's preparing for the next step. Here the dancer has completed four of the same steps repeated where she would bring the left leg out, the right foot slightly behind the left, and then the left foot across the right, and then repeat everything on the right side. And now she is transitioning into a new step and I can tell that because she's not fully crossed over with this right foot. I would expect it to be more over here, a little more crossed over. However, I will say that she's done a really good job in this transition moment because she's followed through almost 100% with this step. So it's really easy, especially when a dancer is not experienced or is nervous about the choreography, unsure about the choreography, that they'll cut their step short, especially when they're transitioning to a new step, and she's not done that. I would say if she could have crossed over a teensy bit more here with this leg, that would just be a little bit better. But other than that, I think this is a really a great job of a great example of a dancer following through with all of her movements. Again, great confidence, open sternum, straight back, smile with a gaze forward. Another reason that this sequence, so it's the second time she's done this sequence where she brings this left arm across and then does a turn in the other direction. Another reason that at least this time that she does this, another reason it looks awkward is because of how close her feet are together. It just looks a little bit as if her weight is not very well balanced. And also I would typically expect that as an arm is coming around in this direction that the foot would also do that. So she might consider to help this moment to actually bring this left foot here in a cross position so the right leg would be back but the left would be across using a strong plie as she steps onto that left foot to give her some momentum to help her turn. Great job attempting to spot her head. She's keeping it over her head over her shoulder even though the rest of her body is already turning. Again this is part of the reason I'm not part of the reason I didn't give her a 10 is that these arms in this turn just don't quite add up. They look a little bit awkward. They look a little like they're creating a little bit of drag in the turn and also again would recommend pushing through the ball of this foot getting the weight onto the ball of this foot so that she could turn more effectively. So this is the reason that instead of a 10 I gave the dancer a 9 because this moment looks a little bit awkward It's this whole 4 to 8 counts here is a little awkward and part of the reason it looks awkward to me is that This arm started up here and is making its way around She's done the arm movement quite slowly relative to all the other arm movements so far Which is and also this downness of it is adding to a feeling of heaviness so if there's any way she could bring it around quickly and make a shape with it as she comes through or Maybe the arm could go up and around or maybe it needs to go even slower. So it looks a little bit more intentional Here's another example of where the dancer has executed great control. As she brought this, so she was on both feet, she brought her left leg out, she brought her right leg slightly behind her, and now in this moment she is crossing that left leg in front of the right. As she has brought this foot across, she started on the ball of her foot and then rolled through to the heel. Again, that's helping to soften the blow of the step so that it looks really controlled, it looks really smooth, and it looks really elegant. I think another thing she's doing well in this moment is that even though she's crossing her feet in this way, she's keeping her pelvis relatively straightforward, and by doing that she's actually emphasizing the X shape here because it's a contrast between what's happening with the hips. If she were to rotate her hips as well, it wouldn't look like an X from the front, from the downstage perspective anymore. Again, great control with the arms. She's keeping them enough away from her body. They're really consistent this whole time, even though she's changed her step. Her posture is still excellent. She looks really confident and it looks like she's having fun and at ease, which again is really helpful for the audience, and the audience can be at ease and also have fun watching. What I would recommend in this moment to keep this turn even crisper is to push through the ball of this foot into the floor and quickly transfer the weight onto the ball of this other foot so that she could rotate effectively on the ball of the right foot rather than being on a flat foot here. Here the dancer is setting herself up for success because before she even starts the choreography she is ready. She's in a ready position. She's got her feet planted firmly, her arms are down by her sides, her gaze is straightforward, and she's in a place from which she can move almost anywhere on time. So I really appreciate that she's putting herself in a good position before she even begins the choreography. This is a great moment here. The dancer is preparing for a turn She's kept a strong shape here with this arm while bringing this one out in a strong strong way Energy is really coming out through her fingertips She's also looking over her left shoulder here, which is emphasizing this line here of the arm My only critique would be that she's already beginning to turn before she's fully prepared to turn at least with her feet So there's a little bit of an awkward Internal rotation with the hips I would recommend that she keep the hips forward while the arm is forward here with the toes facing down Stage and that way her pelvis could stay in The both hips could stay in the same orientation throughout this turn other than that a great preparation here So again with this step the dancer is making it look super sassy and cute and interesting. She's changed her facial expression to be a bit sassier. She's shimmying through the shoulders in a really excellent clear way and her hip movements are also really adding to this because not only is the pelvis rotating up and back, she's also bringing it side to side a little bit and so it gives it gives the illusion that the hips are doing a lot of movement, especially because the feet are pretty close together and so that the closeness together of the feet really emphasizes the movement of the pelvis and it looks really interesting. It looks really cute. And she's not distracting from the amazing work she's doing here because she's keeping the arms really strong. If the arms were weak here or not very specific it would really detract from the beauty of the hip and shoulder movements, but she is not doing that. She's keeping the arms really specific and really strong and really clear and consistent. So the dancer so far with the choreo has, in the choreography, the dancer has been doing repetitions of four or eight, and she just completed four of a step where she would bring one foot out and then back in to meet the other and then go the opposite direction. Now she has switched to a new step, which is very similar to the previous one, but what I'd like to point out that she's doing well is she's differentiating this new step in a very subtle way so that it does look like a different step. And that fits really well with the phrasing of the music. It really emphasizes the phrasing of the music and again demonstrates good technique that she understands that even though these two steps are similar, that they're not the same. And she's demonstrating that partly because previously, with the previous step, she was going out and then coming right back in while keeping this foot right over this area. So she would bring the weight out on this foot, lift this foot slightly, but place it right back down in the same place. What she's doing differently here is she had her weight on this right leg. She brought her left leg out, but rather than lifting the right leg and placing it right back in place, she's just slightly stepped behind herself, which again is different than the previous step and will differentiate this step from that one, which adds interest for the audience and again helps to emphasize the phrasing of the music because the phrase just changed and so is the step. Here the dancer is completing a turn and as she's turning she had her arm in the front initially Actually was to her left initially But facing downstage with the arm and then she brought the arm up and behind her head and it looks really really Intentional really really clear. She's also kept this right arm super strong on the hip the whole time that she's turning which is contributing to the sense of clarity interest and consistency that this dancer and confidence that this dancer exudes So here we can see, oh no we can't. She did slightly better this time. So this is the second time she's done a turn where she brings her right arm, excuse me, left arm across her body and then turns clockwise. Her arms are a little more consistent with this run, which I really appreciate, especially on the end of her turn here, where the positioning of the arms is almost the same as each other. It's a little bit hard to see in this frame, but as she's coming around, I can see that. And you can see it partly in this moment because of where the hands are located and the shape that they're in. She may be attempting to spot her head. It looks like she's in the process of whipping her head around. And I can tell that because this camera looks blurry. The ponytail is flying and also the cervical spine is rotated more than the shoulders are, which is how we spot our head. Again, with turns, I might recommend she go ahead and be on the balls of her feet to help the turns be more effective. Great smile, great epama. Epama refers to the head, neck, and upper shoulder positioning of the body. And this is really beautiful. She's very confident. She's got a smile on her face, which is lovely. It's not necessary for every performance, but can really help to enhance the audience experience because it makes the dancer look at ease and the dancer is enjoying themselves. And that helps the audience to relax and enjoy themselves as well. And again, just conveys confidence, you know, so does her gaze straightforward as well as this epama, but great sternum, open sternum here. Great posture as well, all conveying a sense of confidence, joy, and ease with what she's doing. The arms are very well coordinated and very specific. I like that they're far enough away from her body that she's really able to emphasize the shape she's making. Also, a little hard to see in this frame because she's wearing black and it's kind of blending in with this part of the room, but she is pushing into the right hip here as she steps on the right leg. And that's really nice because what that's creating is a sway back and forth with the hips, which is really what this step that she's doing here is, it really is designed to showcase, designed to showcase the hips, and she's doing that really well. One way that she's accomplishing that is by having almost straight knee here, so that's helping to push the hip upwards, but she's also pliaying through this leg, which is also, again, going to help to push this hip upwards. And she's counterbalancing that really well with the arm shapes here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Her shoulders are moving slightly more than her hips, but her hips are still moving a great deal. So right here, she's emphasizing her shoulders, which is fine because she is still using her hips. So she's able to do both here, and this is an improvement from what she was doing earlier in the sequence. And again a symbol or signifier of her artistry, the dancer is now putting her hands on her head so she is making these choices regarding her arm movements that are completely her own and it's great that she is is exhibiting the sense of style that she does own. The dancer doesn't complete this last arm movement. Her arm should be Straight up above her head. Her arm right now is bent. It's not fully extended It's important that the dancer does Complete all of her steps, especially if it's the last step in a series Of steps that are repeating It's important that her last step is just as powerful and complete as the first one or the third one etc in that series Even though the dancer's shoulders are really wonderful, rotating one higher and then the other, her hips should also be matching in terms of motion and coordination. So her shoulders have a great movement with them alternating one higher one lower. Her hips should also be moving horizontally and on like a diagonal angle backwards. Right now her hips are not moving that much. She has most of the movement constituting her shoulders, which is great that she does have that movement in her shoulders, but again her hips should be matching her shoulders here. The dancer's hands are a bit odd here. They're not really in a position. They're just dangling there. So as before, when the dancer had too much tension in her hands, now her hands aren't in a position. So the dancer would be better at having her arms either completely straight out, straight down, but right now they're in an in-between stance, not really designated in any area of the space. The dancer makes great stylistic choices. Here she's choosing to put her arms on her hips. This is not part of the choreography. This is a stylistic add-on that she put into the sequence, which shows her artistry. The dancer executes this arm movement while with her arms in a diagonal, both of them reaching straight. The dancer's fingers are a bit tense. We see all five of her fingers spread out, pointing into space. Instead, she could relax her fingers, but keep her arm as engaged. It's great that her arm is straight here with energy. Just her fingers are a bit tense. So she could put her fingers together in a blade, meaning that all the fingers are touching each other so that her fingers aren't tense, but yet her arm still has energy. The dancer seems like she's unsure of some part of the sequence in terms of her looking to the corner of the room for clues and the dancer really should be looking straight ahead. Looking sideways is an indicator that she is unsure and that she is looking for some help. The dancer now has great energy in her hips. We see a lot of hip movement both horizontally and vertically. This is a hip movement that she was lacking before but now her hips are matching her shoulders. She has a lot of shoulder energy and a lot of hip energy and movement. The dancer has great range of motion in her shoulders. Her shoulders are moving up and down as she's rolling her shoulders backwards with alternating right shoulder higher than left shoulder higher. That's great.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

It really would help to play this piece, start to finish more to build up the finger strength and endurance towards the end of the piece. For this section of the piece, it would help to isolate the parts and play the left hand for a bit alone just to gain more clarity to the pitches and consistency with tempo. They once again successfully transitioned back to the legato style of playing here. Here you can see the left hand wrist is drooping downward again. It would help to lift the wrist and get it more parallel. There was a bit of difficulty with some of the pitches played in that previous phrase. It would help to work on this phrase at a slower tempo and then incorporate it back with the phrase before it leading into the next phrase of the song to get this transition of the piece to be more seamless. The pianist transitioned both left and right hand to a lower spot on the keyboard with ease for this next section of the piece. Here the pianist is demonstrating great technical accuracy. The left and right hand are playing very different independent parts and the left hand is shifting a lot across up and down the keyboard to play a wider range of notes in this section of the piece. The left hand wrist is continuing to sag once in a while. It would just help to focus on keeping this wrist more lifted and parallel for it to be more comfortable while playing. Here the pianist is playing a few phrases in the piece with right hand alone. They are getting a nice clear delicate sound and you can see the right hand fingers are nice and curved on the keys. Here the left hand is playing chords and holding the chords while the right hand plays the melodic line. So far the pianist playing is very legato or smooth and they are maintaining a steady tempo and accuracy with the pitches played. Here they moved their hand up an octave or eight keys higher to play this same pitch, but in a higher octave and you can hear the entrance is much more smooth and delicate. There is a bit of inconsistency with the tempo in these few phrases. You can see here the right hand fingers are extended so they can cover a wider range of notes. There was a bit of uncertainty with the transition here. It would help to practice a few phrases before this section of the piece leading into this new spot to help the transition be more successful and for the pianist to maintain an even playing speed throughout. Here there was a bit of an abrupt stop to the pianist playing, but overall they really demonstrated great technical proficiency of their instrument, incredible speed to their playing, in particular sections of the piece, and accuracy with pitch and rhythm throughout. Here, an extra key was pressed by the right hand thumb by accident. It would just help to practice this section a little bit at a slower tempo, watching the right hand thumb to make sure it lands on the key that is needed for that particular pitch. Here, the left hand is playing staccato notes or short notes, while the right hand continues to play a challenging melodic phrase. Here a few incorrect pitches were played. It would help to practice these phrases a few more times at a slower tempo. And also, it could also help to just practice the piece, start to finish more for the pianist to gain endurance to make it all the way to the end of the piece successfully. Here the pianist is continuing to demonstrate proper technique when their hands are crossing over one another. Overall, this section has been very consistent in tempo and accurate with pitches and rhythm. Just one pitch here, the lowest pitch played by the left hand pinky, sounded a little bit abrupt. Here, there was the slightest error in pitch played by the right hand. It would help to practice this section of the piece at a slower tempo and gradually speed it back up to tempo to keep it more consistent and even. Here the pianist is demonstrating very delicate soft dynamic levels or volume levels. Here they demonstrated a very graceful hand crossing. The left hand is now in a new spot on the keyboard. The pianist is maintaining great speed and also accuracy with pitch and rhythm throughout this section. Here the pianist is demonstrating excellent technical proficiency of their instrument. They are playing very challenging rhythms. They are shifting around the keyboard to cover a wide span of notes. And they are demonstrating proper hand-crossing technique that is very graceful. The pianist is once performing an accelerando or speeding up and performing this section at a faster tempo. Right away the pianist demonstrated a song hands together. They were playing legato or very smoothly and expressively. Here the pianist is once again playing hands together. The left hand is playing the same melody as the right hand, just an octave lower or eight notes lower. They are getting good synchronization between the hands and maintaining a nice legato smooth sound and accuracy to their pitch and rhythms. Here you can see the left hand fingers are extended to cover an octave or a range of eight notes. Here the pianist returns to their original playing tempo with ease. Here there was the slightest bit of hesitation on one of the pitches. Further practice would help the pianist perform this section more confidently. The hands are now playing independent musical phrases. The pianist is maintaining their technical accuracy in pitch and rhythm so far in this new section. Here the pianist transitioned to the new section of the piece seamlessly. They're playing very fast rhythms in both hands a few seconds prior, and now are playing more smoother legato notes right away. Here the left hand wrist is drooping a bit. I would recommend curving the fingers more and getting a more parallel wrist. Here the pianist is performing a section of the piece with many challenging shorter rhythms and they seem to be performing an accelerando or a tempo that is speeding up faster and faster. The pianist is attempting to perform their starting pitches. You can see that this low E flat key is over responsive. The pianist is not pressing aggressively and it's just making a loud abrupt sound. It's the instrument and not the pianist. Here the pianist is demonstrating great right hand technique. They first played a descending melodic phrase in the right hand at a challenging speed. Just now they were playing two adjacent keys with two different fingers. They were going back and forth between these two pitches at a very challenging speed and still getting a nice clear consistent sound to their playing.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He's doing just a ball change step. And so what's supposed to happen is when he steps back, he's only stepping on the ball of his foot, and then he steps forward with his full foot. So before when he's stepping back, he was stepping back flat. So it just kind of kept the energy really low. You want to keep it springy and a little more up. So here the dancer is doing some step kicks and he's hopping as well. He's kicking front and then side and he's keeping his leg up. So really nice job keeping his balance on that leg up. Again I would definitely maybe tweak this a little bit so it matches the beat of the music. So maybe just doing step, kick, step, kick on the horns just so it just ties in a little bit better. So the dancer is doing a series of kicks, just stepping and kicking, but he's adding like a hop to it and I don't think that's necessary because it makes him just really not match the energy and style of the music. And also, you know, not being on the rhythm of the music and the tempo. So I would just take out the hops and just do a step kick and then add the kick side side but try to get back on the music because it's hard to like match and keep up. So this dancer, I think just being so off the timing really made it hard to connect with and watch. And I think he had some moments in there where if he just either slowed down the steps or didn't jump as much, I think for this style of music it doesn't really, it just doesn't really connect. So it's hard as an audience member to watch and kind of feel any real energy because the music and the movement is not really connecting. And it's such a powerful song, you want to make sure that your movements are connecting. And I felt like he was really weighted in his feet, so going up a little bit more on those toes, feeling a little lighter, bending your knees, and just kind of making sure your full body is moving. Because I just felt like his upper body was a little more stiff than his lower, but he did have really good use of the space, so really good job moving all around the space. So right now the dancer is twisting his feet on the floor. He kind of trips back a little bit towards the back and I think it would help if he was up on his toes instead of having the whole flat foot on the floor because it's a little harder to twist that way. So just definitely go up and releve and you can twist a lot easier on your toes. So here he's doing a rock step triple step. He's doing it really well around in a circle and it appears that he has a partner so a little partner dancing as well. A really nice use of the space. I would just kind of I think loosen up the upper body just a little bit because it's a little stiff with his movement.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So they are hanging on with a right hand behind the arm here, and then they were able to bring their left foot back on the wall right here. So again we see opposite points of contact, and this does allow the climber to kind of rotate and pivot around that left foot. So in this case they are rotating the left side of their hip closer to the wall to kind of help reinforce the movement that they're going for. And then the trick here is to make sure that they try and keep their right arm in a straight position, and also keep a tight shoulder where they can kind of turn around on that right shoulder. And this gets the entire body kind of rotating all the way from the foot all the way up to the arm. However another thing that we can kind of see from the beginning of the boulder is that this climber's flagging foot continues to kind of hang out and away from the wall. So this pulls the climber further and further away from the wall every time, so it's forcing them to have to pull on their arms much more. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing the right hand over into the next handhold. So in that position they are again in opposite points, so that's gonna be a left hand with a right foot. So this does encourage the climber to kind of rotate their body so the right side of the body is getting closer to the wall and this encourages the movement that they're trying to go for. So again, this is kind of a similar position where they're sitting down on their right leg, left arm is in a straight position. And this is a good thing to kind of conserve the energy in the upper body and utilize the strength that they have in their lower body. So here we can see the clown was able to make the next move of bringing their right hand over into the next handhold here. So in this position we can see that they are hanging on with a left hand here. And they did place a right foot down in this position right here. So this position is a much more controlled position and this is actually what we call a backstep move. In where they're using opposite points of contact from each other. And the main point is to encourage the use of their legs in order to push them up into the next move. So here we see exactly that. That the clamber is kind of sitting on their right leg because it's in a bent position here. And when they're ready they're going to be pushing off of that right leg with the help of this left flagging foot. And that would encourage them to kind of use their legs to push them up into the next movement here. And then here we can see in this left arm it's a straight position and this encourages them to kind of conserve the energy on that arm. So this is a much better position that I wish the clamber did in their first opening move. Because this would have been a nice way of conserving their energy and relying on their legs to move them up into their next hold. Without relying so much on their arms to pull them up. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the final move I'll bring in the right hand over to the final hold here. I mean in this position We can see that they are in opposite points of contact So it's going to be a left hand as well as a right foot in this position here and then in this case the climbers focusing on rotating the right side of Their hip closer to the wall and this helps to guide them in the direction that they want to go to This is a better position because we can kind of see how much the leg is in the bent position here While their left arm is in a straight position So this again shows that they're reinforcing how much they're using their lower body, which is always a good thing I'm in the conserving the energy on the upper body Especially because they're getting tired from being at the top of the boulder And so here we can see an example of by allowing themselves to be in an extended position because they were originally hanging on or putting that foot on the yellow hold right there and now in this position we do see that they had to kind of release that foot from that position in order to kind of reset themselves where they needed to be. So I would never really encourage climbers to do this because it does force 100% of their body weight on their upper body and then here in particular we can see that the arms are in a very bent position here so this does use up a lot of energy very quickly on their upper body as well as their core tension just because they have to engage their cores to swing their feet back into the wall and get into a position that they need. So I'd always encourage climbers to make sure they have at least one foot on the wall at all times to prevent this from happening. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring their right hand up and so they're now in a match position on this yellow hold here. So in this position the climber quickly did this move by hanging on with their left hand and then placing a right foot on this yellow holder here. So again this does kind of allow the climber to kind of transfer the body weight over to the right so they're going to be underneath their right arm. And then by doing that this helps them to bring up their other arm into that position. One thing I'm noticing though again in this position the climber is allowing their flagging foot to kind of hang out and away from the wall. So this kind of pulls away from the fact that they're trying to keep their body close to the wall and with this constant flagging foot kind of swinging out and away from the wall. It's kind of pulling the climber away from the wall forcing them to have to squeeze harder on their hands. So here we can see the climber was able to make the first move of bringing the right hand over to the next handhold. So in the starting position the climber is hanging on with the left hand here, as well as the left foot in this position here. And so because the climber is using two points of contact that are on the same side of their body, which is their left hand and left foot, what this does is it doesn't actually force the body to go down to the left side of those two points. And so what's ending up to happen is the climber has to compensate for that balance in a certain way as they move over for that right hand. So one thing that we can see happening is that right leg kicking down and away from the wall. And that's just a result of this rotation that's taking place around those two points. So normally I would not encourage climbers to be in a position like this, because on top of that, the climber is also forced to have to pull and hang with their left arm here to kind of fight off that rotation as well. So this is forcing the climber to use a lot of upper body strength straight off the bat, which doesn't do a good thing about conserving their energy. So I would always kind of encourage climbers to make sure in a balanced position where they're not having to rely on pulling strength in order to complete a move. So what I would have encouraged for this climber is instead of putting a left foot on the starting foot hold, I would encourage them to place a right foot on the starting foot hold. And this would allow them to kind of hang straight down with their left arm and push off that right foot in the direction that they need to over with this right hand. And so here we can see the Clamor was able to make the next move of bringing that left hand over into the next handhold here. So in this position they are hanging on with a right hand here and they did decide to keep a low left foot here. So one thing that's good about this position is they are utilizing points of contact with each other again and then what we can see happening here is they are rotating the left side of their body closer to the wall here to kind of encourage the move that they're doing with the left hand here. However with their right flagging foot we can kind of see that it's just hanging out into space and actually pulling away from the wall. So this actually helps to pull the rest of the Clamor's body away from the wall making it harder for them to kind of really place a lot of body weight on that left leg. And then on top of that we can see the distance that the Clamor is putting themselves in from their left foot all the way to the left hand and this is kind of what I would call an extended position and where their leg is basically fully straight and the arm is completely straight over the body and what this does is it does force a lot of extra tension on their core in order to stay on the wall because what's most likely to happen at this point is that left foot will slide off that foothold because it's hard to maintain that tension which causes them to swing out and away from the wall and then forcing them to hang harder on their hands which uses up a lot of energy. So I would always encourage Clamor's to make sure they avoid getting themselves into an extended position if they can and this would mean placing a higher foot before committing to this hand sequence because right now this just makes it a little bit harder for the Clamor to continue climbing throughout the boulder. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring in their left hand over into the next handhold here So both hands are really close to each other now in this position But before bringing in that left hand the climber was hanging on with the right hand And then did also use a left foot out here So again, these are opposite points of contact and they are separated from each other So this does place the climbers body in between the two points. So this does naturally place them in a very controlled position The trick here is to make sure that they transfer the body weight over to the right side So then that way they can hang straight down directly underneath Their right arm, which is exactly what we see happening here So as a result both arms go in a very straight position Directly underneath the handhold as opposed to away from the handhold So this is a much more controlled position because we can see that with this leg It's still in a bent position. So that means that there's a lot of body weight being placed on it And because her arms are directly underneath her This does encourage her to kind of conserve the energy in her arms And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing the left hand up into the next handhold So in this position they are hanging on with the right hand here and they did utilize a left foot down low over here So because you're using opposite points of contact and these points of contact are kind of separated from each other This does allow the climber to kind of get in a coordinated position in between those two points, which is a good thing to see So this is a much more balanced position However, one thing that I noticed is that as the climber moves up with that left hand Instantly the climbers bodyweight kind of falls back and away from the wall One of the main reasons why I think this is the case is the use of their flagging foot a lot of the time So far I've seen that their flagging foot is kind of hanging out and away from the wall And with this flagging foot hanging away from the wall and actually pulls the rest of the body from the wall So this could be one of the main reasons why the climbers kind of extending out after grabbing onto that left hand So I would always encourage climbers to really make sure they are aware of the body tension that they need To maximize the amount of use in their lower body Because right now being forced that they're hanging out away from the wall This is forcing the climber to have to pull and pinch harder on their hands more than they probably need to And especially for the second move of the climb. I would encourage the climber to kind of conserve the energy a little bit better", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He keeps the pull-up position but what's important here is that in order for the climber to make the reach he needed to propel himself with much force. The reason why the left leg is extended and the climber has made a kick for this to come off a strong squat but since there is no foot placement for that extended leg the climber just had crunched up the leg and has done a quick kick to help with the motion when going up for the move. Here we can see the climber performing a foot hop, foot swap. So the climber relies on the grips of both, both being pinches. Then the climber is able to create pressure to pull himself in and hold on to that weight while he does that foot switch, releasing the left foot to take the right foot in place. He places the right foot with the sole of the toe box area to be pressed. This is a big enough hole where the climber was able to do a quick jump to make that swap. Here we can see the climber moving the left hand prematurely out of the start hold. The climber first must lift up the right foot to be potentially on a flag, meaning extended out and off the mat. But this would need to be first stable and controlled by keeping the arms extended and fully having the grips and the foot that's in place hanging on to the climber's stability before starting the climb. Here we can see the climber has completely swung out and has dropped the feet down below. This means that the climb is over for him as he already touched the ground. Due to the motion of the swing being so powerful and out, the climber no longer was able to pinch onto the hold and potentially he has stepped off from the climb due to losing pressure on the grips. Here we can see the climber starting at a one-hold start. Both hands are going to be placed in the same hold. As we can see, the climber has made the placement with the thumbs underneath and the fingers above. This is called a pinch. The climber looks and secures it just as a clamp, where the pressure is a lot generated by placing the thumbs underneath. It helps the pinch also if the climber can apply pressure from above. This being the fingers. To do the pressure on the fingers, the climber must lean back in order to apply pressure onto the grip. The climber is also bringing the left toe into placement. This one is a big hold. The climber is on, so it's able to apply a lot of the surface from the toe box. Once the climber gets to bring the left foot onto the wall, then the climb will start. because the reach was dynamic, the climber then has placed all of the force onto that hold above, keeping that palm open and creating friction by leaning on that hold is important. So the climber, while committing into that grip, has let the feet automatically have come off due to losing pressure down below at the feet when making the move. To keep himself closed, the climber is still engaging on the pinch while the feet are off the wall. This is called feet just cut off. So in order for the climber to get back into the wall, he will have to hold on to those grips tight and engage the core to bring the feet at a higher stance onto the next placement. Here we can see the climber be ready for getting into an explosive position aiming for the hold up above. Now in order to do this, body position is important. So the climber had swapped his feet and had left the leg, the left leg to be hanging. This to help the climber with balancing when going up for the throw. So the body positioning in this one, he's keeping his right side fleshed with the wall and this is important because the climber will need to have the reach going out with the right hand. Now as we can see to help with the climber keeping that side close to the wall, he has bended his right leg to have the knee pointing out to the left and he brings himself with chest forward first, this being helped by the pull that he's holding on to that pinch in this moment and dropping the left leg helps the climber to keep the hips to be pointed to the right side towards the wall. And as we can see his leg is bended creating an imaginary squat even though he is doing most of the precision for from the right toe. Now the climber will be using the leg bended so that he can propel himself for the next move. Here, the climber is quickly making the move to the next hold. In order to do that, the climber needed to leave the right foot off the mat, which is the one sustaining all of the climber's weight. And has done this quickly by stepping up on the highest foot to transfer the weight over. As soon as the climber made the pressure of the highest foot, the climber is just leaving the mat and quickly has moved the left hand to go out left.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He's not holding them. While he is holding them, he's not moving them while he's dancing. They're just idle. He should be engaging his arms when he's dancing so that they're not so stiff and independent from his spine and the rest of his body that's moving. The dancer is leading with his left foot forward, using his heel first. He should never be stepping with his heel first. He should always be stepping, leading with his toes. The dancer is not standing completely tall in his verticality. We see his spine is a bit condensed in total His entire body is a bit condensed especially since he is a tall man. He can't stand up tall just needs to extend through his head that happens as a Consequence of the bottom of his spine or his coccyx bone straight up. He should be extending So he's standing tall right now. He's a bit hunched over The dancer isn't dancing in tandem with the music. He is dancing pretty independent of the music. He's not on rhythm most of the time. His pacing doesn't match the tempo of the music. The dancer is moving flat-footed with his standing foot to foot on the ground, flat on the ground. Instead, he should have his weight anchored towards his toes with his heels slightly off the ground so that he can maneuver around the space with much more ease and be lighter on his feet. The dancer's leg movement isn't exactly clear here. His right leg should be straight behind him right now. It's a bit on a diagonal instead of straight behind him, and his knee isn't fully stretched and straightened. So the movement is a bit unclear here. When the dancer does these triple steps, these steps of three, one, two, three steps, on the second step his feet should meet together. He doesn't really emphasize the step, doesn't make it apparent, his footwork's not articulate here. It should be three distinct steps and on the second step his feet should be meeting together. Again, the dancer is hunching over and not extending completely tall in his verticality here. Even if he was to bend a knee, which is fine, his upper body shouldn't be curved the way it is here. It should be in a straight line. The dancer is using his arm as if he is dancing with a partner, which is common in this swing dance style. However, there's no partner there, so his movements with his arms are a bit awkward. Especially it's kind of adding to him condensing his spine because he's bending as if he's dancing with a partner that's shorter than him. But even if the partner was shorter than him, he should be extending his arm further, not bending at his spine. So for him, practicing his arm movements aren't necessarily helping his full body here. He'd be better off dancing as if he is dancing as a solo, which he is dancing as a solo. So his arm movements should reflect that instead of an invisible partner. The dancer is looking downward at times. He sees a lot of the floor in the frame. Instead, he should be looking straight out so that his spine is in a straight line. Right now, his neck is tilted a bit forward, so it's not in line with his spine. His spine should actually be one vertical line.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I would just encourage them to think of what part of their foot should they be turning on. Because sometimes they lean back into their heels when they turn, and that's an easy way to fall over. So just being careful about where the weight should be on the foot is important for safety. I would encourage the dancer to lift their gaze. Right now it looks like they're looking at the floor, but if they lift their gaze, it would open up their chest and torso and create more presence throughout the movement. I would encourage the dancer to incorporate their shoulders and their torso into this arm movement so it doesn't look like the arm is just kind of flapping. It creates fluidity of the movement. The dancer has really great energy. I think they should think about the details and their shoulder placement in this movement. So the flexion of their hands, what part of the feet are they tapping on, where should their abs, abdominals be engaged. Those details take it to the next level of this basic choreography. I would encourage a dancer to think about their foot placement. It kind of seems like their feet are kind of rotated in a bit.

I think it could be a positioning thing. The video is hard to tell I think one adjustment sees about to be, you know, not opposite of pose So I think by really back flagging this right foot He can really own this left hand pinch and kind of stay better balanced and Then really just focus on keeping that core tight, especially on pinches You know staying underneath them keeping the core tight Keeping the tension on the feet", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So when we're placing the ball here we need a slight or no side spin at all. He does an excellent job of making sure that he puts a slight amount of side spin on the ball so once it hit this portion of the top right corner of the square it went into the basket. When we place it in the top right corner of the square we have to be careful not to put too much side spin on the ball because if we put too much side spin on the ball it will come off too quickly and too hard off of the backboard and now that's where we hit the left side of the rim and that's when we have the opportunity for it to bounce off of the rim and we miss the layup. On this attempt he did an excellent job of putting just a slight amount of side spin so it bounced off the backboard and went into the basket relatively easily. Here the player does an excellent job of keeping two hands on the ball as he's taking his steps and taking the strides to jump off the ground. He makes sure he keeps two hands on the ball and then once the ball passes his shoulder level that's when he begins to extend the ball out and transfers the ball from two hands to his right hand and extend the ball out in his right hand and finish the layup at the apex of his jump. Here the player shows the correct footwork and jumping technique and jumping mechanics for doing a right hand reverse layup when we're jumping off of one foot. As you see he jumps off of his left foot and he does a good job of lifting his knee up to his waist level as he's exploding off of the ground and going up into the air. By lifting this knee up as he jumps that assists, that helps him to explode off of the ground and up into the air and reach the highest capabilities of his one legged jump. On this last layup attempt, he showed off his jumping ability and he made sure that he jumped as high as he can and he was so high above the rim that he didn't need to use the backboard. He just dropped the ball in over the front of the rim. Throughout all of his layup attempts, they all looked the exact same except for this last attempt where he showed off a bit and really demonstrated how high he can get. And when we're able to reach this level of our jump, we can just easily drop the ball over the front of the rim and into the basket. taking a look at the placement of the ball on the backboard you see it slightly hits outside this portion of the square so due to the placement on the backboard a good amount of sidespin is needed for the spin off of the backboard and into the basket and he did an excellent job of putting the correct amount of sidespin on the ball so it would spin off of the backboard and go into the basket Here you see the ball is extended out in his right hand and he's releasing the ball from his right hand off of his fingertips at the apex of his jump. This is really good technique as far as him extending the ball out in his right hand by him extending the ball out that high and away from his body with his right hand that makes it harder for the defense to contest his shot. You take a look at his left hand you see how it's down low. Ideally we would like the hand to be up a little bit higher to protect the shot so if the defense tries to contest the shot from his left side that arm, they would have to come across his arm which would be a foul or they will by them making contact with his arm and the referee doesn't call the foul. His arm will slow the defender down long enough for him to release this ball off his fingertips before the defense has an opportunity to block or", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Right here as you can see outside of the box is slightly outside of the box but only a little bit so we only don't really need that much side spin in order for us to make the ball go into the basket and the player used just a little bit of side spin due to the placement of the ball off of the backboard and was able to spin right into the basket. On this shot you can see the placement of the ball here is on that top line which is good. It has good height but as you can see here here's the line right here so it's on the inside of the outside of that box. As the ball hits there, if we place the ball there we can't have any side spin. Otherwise the ball is going to spin off the backboard and we're going to miss it off the left side of the rim. On this particular attempt he put a little bit too much side spin and it spinned off the backboard and we missed the shot. Now if you would put that same amount of side spin but hit slightly outside of the box or even a little bit on the line of the box it would have been okay and he would have made the shot but since it was inside of that line and he put that side spin on the ball we end up missing the layup. On this reverse layup attempt, he put side spin on the ball when he released it and had good placement as far as height because the ball hit the top of the white box on the backboard. But as you can see, the ball hit the backboard inside the outside of the white line on the white box on the backboard. So because of the placement of where the ball hit the backboard and the side spin that it created, it forced the ball to miss long on the left side of the basket. on this reverse layup attempt you see that he once again had a good height and placement of the ball at the top of the line on the top of the white box on the backboard. However on this one you see that the ball is placed inside of the outside of the white box on the backboard. So when it's inside of the backboard inside this line right here on this box we don't want any side spin. As you can see with this example he had too much side spin on the ball so the ball was spinning too much this way for the placement of the ball on this spot on the backboard so it ended up coming off and we miss it to the left side of the basket. The player shows really good footwork here for the reverse lip. As he takes the dribble, he makes sure that he steps with that left foot as he takes that dribble. Because he takes the dribble and steps with that left foot, when he picks up the ball, that left foot, even though it's still on the ground, he picks up the ball with two hands, it does not count as a step. This is what's known as a gather step. So when he picks up the ball, that first step will be with his right foot, when he puts the right foot down here in this area for step one. And then he'll take his left foot for step two, put it down in here for the layup. So right here is a good example of when you want to take your final dribble. You take your dribble with your right hand, step with that left foot, and you'll pick it up. So you take those steps, one, two, and you end up jumping off of that left foot. On this layup attempt, you can see that on the side of the box, he was able to place the ball slightly inside the line of the box there. But however, it's below this top line of the box. But it's still a good shot because it's above the bottom line of this box. So as long as we place the ball above the bottom line of the top of the box, we have a really good chance of making the shot. Now when we're playing against less athletic players, it's okay for us just to raise the ball, hit the ball, place the ball off the backboard. Just slightly above the bottom of the box, as shown as an example with this layup. But when we're playing against higher level, more athletic players who can jump really high and block a lot of shots, it's important for us to place the ball at the top of the box or above. So that we're not worried about our shot being blocked or disrupted by athletic defender. On this attempt right here you can see on the plane of the top of the box it has really good height. So the height that we placed the ball off of the backboard was really good. But as you can see it's on the outside of the box. So since it's here on the outside of the box and it's that far outside of the box we need to put a lot of side spin on this ball to make the ball spin a lot in this direction so it can go right into the basket. Unfortunately on this attempt he didn't have enough side spin and so it spent a little bit but it ended up coming up short and hitting the front of the rim and we missed the shot. The player here shows really good ball placement off the backboard by hitting the top corner of this box here. We hit the top of that box right there and also the side of the box here so right there at that intersection of the top of the box and the side of that box perfectly places the ball off that spot and it goes right into the basket.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And after milking this hold a little bit, so when a climber says that you're milking the hold it means you're bumping around on it trying to figure out the best way to get it. So the climber milks this hold a little bit and gets a hand heel in on the star jug.

He needs to place this ball, stop, dead still, stationary, and then kick it or initiate a kicking action. That would actually be a true penalty kick. So that would be the recommendation that he do in this sequence. So one thing that he's also doing in this picture specifically is that he's not going into a place where he's having a back lift in this direction here, slight back lift and then a forward motion with his foot. And that's because he's not taking a run up into the ball, right? So he's eliminating that and that helps create some of that power as it goes, as he like he transfers force through the ball. Here what he's doing is he's planted one foot here and he plants one foot here and he's simply lifting this foot now off the ground here and then initiating the swing as soon as he lifts his foot to here. So there's zero momentum being created here. There's no power, no force being created as he goes into this because there's no leg swing. There's zero leg swing. He's just lifting his foot and then bringing it through to this position. So this is incorrect. So my recommendation is that he start from further behind the ball, that he take two, three steps into the ball to get to this position. But as he arrives there, he can lift and then come back through and swing through the ball. That would help a lot with this because right now he's not generating any power and not giving good direction to the ball with his kick. So here, what you notice is that he placed the ball right here as opposed to the beginning of the exercise where he placed the ball right here. Again, if it's a penalty kick, this should be taken from the exact same spot every single time in order to create repetition of a technique that will transfer to an actual gameplay. Right now, this is just him placing the ball wherever he wants to and it's not a, not, it's not nothing that he would actually use or repeat into a game. So that's number one. Number two is the passing technique. You can see with that plant foot, it's consistently going this way. He's overcompensating with this by hitting the ball more towards the inside of his foot. And so it's coming off here towards this direction, his intended target. I mean, it shouldn't be that hard to miss because he's shooting only from, you know, a few, a few meters or a few yards away. So it's all about just giving the ball direction. He's a bit more bent over with his upper body here, which is better than what we've seen before, where he was leaning more backwards. So I like that. I like that his support leg is bent here. So you can tell he's got some balance with his arms out to the side. That's better there. And he's following through towards his intended target. That kicking foot is following through towards that action, but he's not generating any power. It's because he's not taking a run up into the ball. He's taking one step into the ball and then kind of lightly passing the ball on purpose without any speed. This is another illegal one that I want to point out where the ball is bouncing actually up and down in this current position and the ball is not stationary and on the ground and he's actively looking to strike this ball. You can tell by the movement with his back foot. Again, not a legal kick. Recommendation here that he gets the ball and he places it down stationary and then initiates the kicking sequence. This is probably the best that I've seen so far with that support foot in terms of the like the how where it's placed in Relation to the ball, so it's next to the ball and in this sense That's not in front of the ball. So the toes just like even with the front side of it. That's great. I like that a lot His knee is soft and bed With from the support side of things his arms are slightly out to the side. I think that's good What I don't like about this picture is that he's leaning backwards again If he was just leaning forward head over the ball More torso over the ball and brought a little speed a little power into the ball and then went through and followed through landed on That kicking foot. I think he would do a lot better at giving the ball direction creating power Etc. Right now. This is just he's it's not there's not a lot being brought through into the ball It's the same repeated mistakes that he's making over and over again But at least what I like in this clip is just the Like a good picture of where that foot should be planted where that toe should be pointed Because it naturally helps align his hips to his target So as you can see just on the follow through portion of this, this is a very minimal follow through as he kicked it with his left foot. He's doing the same thing again where he's putting one foot staggered in front of the other and then just lifting that back foot and swinging it in a forward direction. So no power, no momentum being brought through into the ball to create power and direction for the ball. So here this is just showing the follow through. It's a very soft, not quick or not fast follow through where he's just kind of landing now on this kicking foot and sort of transferring weight from this foot to this foot here. Again, he's really not trying to shoot the ball hard. It looks like he's actively trying to just pass the ball and hit the ball soft without power. The subject here is taking a penalty kick where he's placed the ball stationary down on the ground. That's correct, the ball is not moving. It's towards the center of the goal, so it should be at a fixed position. Typically there would be a dot here and the ball would have to be placed somewhere inside that dot. That dot essentially. So this is where he needs to place it, needs to be touching that. And then he can initiate or go back as far as he wants away from the ball and move into the ball and create a shooting action to then strike it at the goal. There is no direct opponent here, so no goalkeeper in the goal. This is also not 12 yards away from the goal, so that's another thing that we just got to consider as you think about what actually is a penalty kick versus what is not. But he's initiating an actual penalty kick sequence. What I think he could improve on immediately from what I'm seeing in this picture is just the distance of how far he's running up into the ball. He's taking one step back and then he's going one step into the ball. So there's no forward momentum, no power going into his strike. He's going to be hitting basically a one step inside the foot pass more than likely into the goal. So really just a passing technique into the goal at that point and versus a real opponent, that wouldn't be enough to get past an opponent. So my recommendation is that he puts his ball down, he steps back two to three, maybe even four steps back and get into a consistent rhythm each repetition. That's what we would want to see. On this kick, this is just again with the support foot constant mistake. This guy's making is Support foot here is way too close to the ball It's pointing in this direction here directly there He's over compensating here with over rotating his hips to try to get this one This leg to then strike the ball towards this direction as his planter foot points to the other direction here So his balance is not really is all really messed up here and the balls kind of underneath them a little bit I think again just get this plant foot a little bit to a better space over here, but take a run-up from here Move into the ball plant that foot then strike that's gonna be just like just get that routine down I think if he did that at the bare minimum This would help a lot with the actual shot that he's taking from close range The other thing with that kicking foot is that heel again is higher than the toe and his toes pointed down So what he's not doing is creating a flat hard surface if he locks his ankle toe up heel down That's gonna help and get these arms out a little bit more to the side to help for balance He's gonna have a lot better a lot better of a chance of hitting the ball with power Here, he's moved the ball again to a totally new position. Again, incorrect. We want this ball to go be placed back where it was originally started from the first repetition. Second thing is that he's changed his kicking foot in this picture, so he's now kicking with the left foot. You can see the first error that he's making completely is that that plant foot is well behind the ball. I think in order to just fix this, I would just make a stop him and make a recommendation that that plant foot be here next to the ball and that that toe is pointed towards the direction that he wants to go to help align his hips. I think that as a starting point would help him be a lot more effective in striking the ball. So from that one step setup, here's his actual kicking technique and there's a there's a lot of errors that are occurring here Let's start with his plant foot so the one thing that you see right away is that the plant foot is facing in this direction and It's a full it's fully behind the ball. So there's two issues there Number one is that because it's facing this way his hips will also naturally face that direction So where he's making contact and kicking the ball is actually wide of the goal So to correct that he needs to get this foot to face the goal or his intended target Which will naturally align his hips better towards that direction as opposed to right now where they are currently Okay, so that's number one. Number two is that because this plant foot is behind the ball He's kicking the ball and leaning backwards. You can see that in his upper body completely He's leaning backwards as he's hitting the ball His heel is higher than his toe So his toes slightly pointed down and so all that means is as he kicks that ball that ball is more than likely gonna roll Off the toe of it the toe of his foot and go in this direction So we will we want to correct is be more over the ball with his upper body So he's leaning towards lean forward head over the ball toe would be pointed higher than the heel So it'd be a locked ankle essentially created an L shape as he contacts the ball and That he get that support foot next to the ball so that he can contact the ball more in the center", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

However, she would also benefit from finding some more consistent clarity in the use of her arms, her pelvis, and her upper body.

He's alternating his arms when he does this, switching between one arm and the other. And while this is a greater incorporation of arm choreography, it still appears quite significantly disconnected from the rhythm. He doesn't seem to be making any sort of specific shape. You can see over here on the EcoCam that his hand is just kind of loosely above his head, not shaped in any sort of particular way. And his arm is quite crunched to his head where he would benefit from really extending the arm upwards more significantly, lengthening that line and connecting that movement more to the rhythm. It appears to happen quite sporadically and at times that are a bit awkward in contrast with what's happening with the music and the rest of his body. As the dancer performs a transitional step to change his facing from the back of the room now towards the front of the room, while he is still struggling with the movement, particularly in his upper body and even through his head, he shows he has a solid command or at least a solid understanding, perhaps he's not to the embodied stage yet, but he has a solid understanding over the rhythm, particularly through his footwork. He's able to keep this transition step on rhythm with the music, including a step touch of the other foot, that shows that he has a connection to the rhythm and an understanding of what he should be doing rhythmically that's happening in his lower body but not quite translating to his upper body. As the dancer begins his performance with a basic salsa step moving side to side, he's lacking a specific attention to an embodiment of the rhythm. He's got a lot of movement, particularly in his pelvis, his arms, and his shoulders. However, the rhythm is really disconnected from this movement, and he overall appears quite awkward and off rhythm, particularly through the use of the upper body, even if that lower body is maintaining connection to the rhythm. It would benefit him here to really clarify that movement, particularly in the shoulders, the pelvis, and the arms. As the dancer is continuing to repeat this basic salsa step, his upper body gets looser and more disjointed with the rhythm and the music, which shows that he might be fatigued or might be really losing that connection to the rhythm that he started out having, particularly in his feet. His loosening up shows that he's feeling maybe a little bit more natural, however he's still lacking that connection to the music. He also is now starting to fall off the rhythm in his feet as well, where before he was able to maintain an embodiment of the rhythm in his feet. He's starting to fatigue and lose that connection quite significantly, which is throwing his dance overall off from the rhythm and really disconnecting him from both the technique of the movement as well as the rhythm of the music. As the dancer continues to perform this basic salsa step, now moving around himself a bit more freely, he's still struggling with refinement in his upper body. His head is really kind of wandering around the space, not necessarily tied to the rhythm of the music or the rhythm that's being enacted in his body. He's also got a fairly free-form arm choreography happening, where his arms are kind of gently floating at his sides and making some sporadic larger movements that don't necessarily make sense with what's happening in the music or in the rest of his body. He also needs to continue to work on refining the pelvis and the shoulders. As the dancer continues with this basic salsa step moving side to side, he still has a lot of movement in his upper body, particularly in his shoulders and in his pelvis, which are moving in a way that really is contradicting one another rhythmically. If he were to connect his movement of his shoulder and all the way down through his torso to his pelvis and refine the movement and choreographies of his arms more specifically, he would appear more on rhythm. He's also performing a really basic step with his feet, which is quite repetitive. If he were to embellish this repetition more with perhaps a changing of his facing or shifting of his weight more deeply, he would show a greater command over the movement technique.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The climber is sending up the right foot being pushed will help her gain direction to the hold at reach when engaging onto the pull up to send the left hand. However, in making this stance to gain height the climber's left foot has come out of his foot placement. This will retract the climber when performing the move. The climber was able to secure the left hand placement and when the palm is facing up towards the hole this is called an undercling and in order to sustain it the climber must pull it towards her and when she does the elbow must stay close to the core. The climber starts when she's no longer standing on the mat and has brought the feet up onto the wall to press down so that she's able to raise the hips towards the wall and is able to transfer her weight to the grips by leaning back. The climber was able to send the left hand but unable to apply the grip to the lip of the hold. As we can see the right foot has also come out of place. This will be inevitable for the climber to sustain the move. The climber we can see has engaged into slow pull-ups. This to bring momentum on swinging so when the climber is ready she will lower her center of gravity, extending the arms and engaging forcefully into a pull-up to perform a dynamic move, sending the left hand over to the next hold at reach. The climber retracted the left hand from the next hold and has come into a match at the initial hold and quickly extends the arms. This is good that the climber leans back and relies on the grips in this moment so that she has some time to recover from her arms being engaged. The climber brings the hands inside of the chalk bag, which is attached to her, to spread the chalk on the surface of the palms. The chalk helps the climber to gain a better grip when sustaining the holds as well as absorbing any moisture that may be coming from her hands. The climber in trying to make the next transition of the right hand over either to the same hole to come into a match or the next hold. We can see how her elbow is not coming close to her core. This is due to her stance being spread out where she will eventually need to transition over to the left. The climber is able to make the left hand placement to the next hold and where she places the hand facing up towards the lip of the hold, sliding the fingers behind the hold as this one is a jug and sends the thumb on the outside, this so that the climber is able to engage into a pinch onto the hold. The climbers is starting at a one-hold start where she places both of the hands into the same hold.

So really like digging down into the floor, using your core of course to maintain your balance. I do like that she has her arms out and then this heel is up on the left leg, but just really like grounding yourself and being solid. So bending your knees a little more might help. So that way she doesn't feel like, because the music slows down dramatically, she wants to really stay in the pocket of the music when she drops down. This I would call a nice picture moment where you, as I was able to stop the still, she has a really nice, arms are up, the fingers are nice and relaxed. She's in a really nice plie in her right leg. The left leg is out, the toe is pointed. Her face is there. Her hip is a little bit to the side. So everything is just a really nice picture moment. And I think she thought the song was going to end, but she was able to kind of play it off and keep on going, but this was really nice. So in this part for the kickball chain, she was right on the music perfectly, so she would have done that before. It would have lined up really nicely. So here's another timing issue where right before she was going step step step ball change because that is the beat of the music it's dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot. The second time she did the step step step she did an extra step so then her rhythm was step step step step ball change and so she ended up being off the music so just making sure you're being consistent with the number of steps that you're taking so they match better with the music. So here if you notice the music has changed and so is her energy. It's kind of dropped down a little bit to match the music as well as the rhythm and timing of the music has changed. So it does take her a moment to connect and get on the beat but this is a nice little freestyle moment that she does. So here she's doing a nice classic jazz drag pull. So her arms are rotating around her body up and around this way. And she's also stepping out with her right leg and then dragging her left leg around in a circle. Again, this is a moment where I think she's going to make this bigger and really use the whole space moving all the way around the circle and then landing back here, just to give a little more dynamic to the movement. So here for a few times she's reaching out so stepping and then dragging that leg in as you see here. She uses most of this space. I think she could have come down further this way or come down in this direction and really made that a nice little around-the-world moment in that space and made it even bigger because the music has changed. It's now you hear the horns a little bit more so you want your body to match the music a little more. So from the beginning the dancer is doing a little step out tapping her toe to the side and it's going really nicely with the beat of the music with this low bass that's playing so she's keeping her movements low as well as moving her shoulders which is now moving her arms. When she transitioned from the left side to the right side she kind of missed a step because when she stepped her foot out she took a double step instead of just stepping on the foot to switch sides. So thinking about your weight shifting whenever you want to change feet whatever foot you're changing to it should be the leg that the weight is not on so that way you can easily transfer your weight to the other side. Overall, I think this dancer did a good job. I think counting would have helped a lot just to make better connections with the steps and movements so they flow a little more seamlessly through transitions. But she did a really good use of arms and legs and just trying to listen to the music because it did change a couple of times for this as far as the tempo and timing. So I think counting out would definitely help for the next time. And so here she's doing a pivot. At first she pivoted on her left foot, now she's pivoting on her right foot. And when you pivot you want to make sure that heel is off the floor and it stays glued to the floor so it's pivoting around. And then the other leg is the one that is pushing you around. She's also doing a great job pushing her arms around and I think a little bit of her hips as well to push her body around. So here's a really nice moment where she is perfectly lined up with the music and does something different that matches the music and different from the step that she's done before. She's stepping forward with her left foot and her right leg is back and it drags forward and then her arms are going up and over and around her body. So she's using her full body and almost kind of thrusting her hip a little bit as well to push through. So here she starts to kind of get a bit off of the music. She's doing those tap step where she's going step and shuffle ball change and so I think if she counted out and just paid attention to the beat of the music I think it would have helped for those steps to line up better with the music.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Instead, while the dancer is running backwards towards the right side of the room, she should begin also tilting her body backwards with running backwards so that it's not a disjointed run, stop, and then tilt backwards. So it's just continuing a momentum instead. The dancer's arm is a bit bent here, her right arm, while at her elbow joint. She needs to be extending her arm even further so that the arc or circle she's making above and around her head is fuller and pulled further away from her body. The dancer takes very small steps here basically in place instead of traveling forward and she needs to make those steps more adamant so that her movements are bigger and taking up more space on the floor. The dancer also does a good job of extending her arms completely here in straight lines, and then also to mimic that, extends her legs also in straight lines. The dancer does a good job of holding this pose to end the routine. Once she strikes, she doesn't move out of it, she stays in it so the audience can take it in and so that she could declare clearly that the routine is over. The dancer's feet here are a little sickled, meaning her ankle joint is not in line. Her ankle on her right foot is pulling a little bit too far to the front of the room, and her ankle on her back foot, her left foot, is pulling too far to the left side of the room, making it misaligned. The dancer needs to be careful to make her movements or her foot movements in particular very articulate. Her right, or sorry, her left toe here has a moving in different positions on her toe, on her heel, as she was rotating around. However, she didn't very clearly pick up her left foot off the ground. It's kind of dragging on the ground while she's doing those foot movements or foot positions. So she needs to make a clear indication to lift her foot off the ground while she's doing that. The dancer stops in place here on her right foot before she leans her upper body from her waist up backwards, but this shouldn't be a disjointed movement of her stopping and then leaning backwards. Instead, the dancer's heels should be directly on top of where her toes are, meaning that she needs to pull her ankle on her right foot further to the back of the room and her ankle on her left foot further to the front of the room.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Perhaps just some additional rehearsal is needed to tighten up these transitions and allow her to have more familiarity with the choreography. As the dancer begins with a basic step touch that locomotes her slightly from side to side in the space, she demonstrates to have a bit more of an advanced understanding of the movement vocabulary here. She's got a lot of nice clarity happening in her footwork, as well as some really deeply engaged arms that are engaged in a way choreographically that's appropriate, as well as finding their own kind of connection to the rhythm. She maintains a nice soft bend in her knees, which is activating a nice range of motion in her pelvis, and overall is deeply engaged with the rhythm throughout her body. The dancer appears to struggle again and quite consistently with her transitions between movements. She continues to kind of gaze over to the left-hand side, really looking over to this corner, perhaps because she's forgetting the choreography or is getting distracted by something that's happening off-screen. However, in these moments of transition, even though she struggles to transition from one step to the next, when she finds that next moment, she's able to be really rhythmically engaged and demonstrate a more advanced understanding of the movement itself. As the dancer performs a stationary step touch, she maintains a lot of clarity in her footwork as well as the choreographic inclusion of her arms. She's also finding a nice shimmying motion with her shoulders as well as her pelvis, which is demonstrating that she's able to embody polyrhythm and play on more complex movement dynamics. As the dancer transitions into this basic salsa step that locomotes her forwards and backwards in the space, she appears confident, clear, and rhythmically engaged as she performs this movement. She's got a lot of nice clarity in her footwork, a nice deep bend in her knees, which is helping her to remain grounded, a solid range of motion and inclusion of her pelvis in the movement, as well as her shoulders, and some nice choreographic clarity happening in the arms.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Even if they want to have an upright torso to even still drop that weight and have those knees really bent so then they can move those hips in an under curve and guide each other throughout the space. I would encourage the dancers to point their foot while they're doing these kicks. If it's supposed to be a flexed foot, really over-articulating the flexed foot is also important. So it doesn't look like they're flailing about. It looks very precise. I would encourage them to think about what part of the foot are they stepping. Is it whole foot? Is it ball of the foot? Those details also change the look and feel of where you place your weight, which changes how your partner moves. So all of those details become super important, even if the movement is slow. Again, I would encourage the dancers to think about this connection of the hands and using the hands to push and pull each other either inwards or outwards or out to the side. That connection in partner dance is what tells your partner where to move and allows them to anticipate what to do next. Immediately, I would encourage the dancer to not look at the floor, to either look at each other or look past each other, and to open their gaze to the wide open space, both dancers, so they don't bump into each other. The dancers are not on the rhythm, so I again encourage them to really practice the musicality of this, as well as practicing having power and strength throughout the arms. I encourage the dancers to make sure they have tension in between this, that push and pull that I often talk about when it comes to partner dances so the partner can be guided throughout the steps. I would encourage the dancers to really think about and embody the music. Sometimes they're off of the rhythm and this is not good, especially in a partner dance because even when performing basic choreography, it's important to follow the rhythm so that you and your partner are working off of the same beat.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The right thing to do would be a little bit more front on the note, so a little bit more first finger on the right hand to set that weight up, and then also not taking the bow off the string. She came fairly far off the string and played this really short, but it should be very sustained. We would have liked to hear more crescendo there. The violists kind of gave up, but they should have continued and used up all of the bow all the way to the frog there in the same amount of time. That would have done us a better crescendo and would have been really easy because the weight of the bow naturally increases the closer we get to the right hand. The vibrato being used here is visible but doesn't actually have any audible effect. A little quicker and a little wider so we can actually hear it. That was a well executed what we call a hairpin, crescendo and decrescendo all in one bow. And she did that by using first finger weight delivered via pronation of the arm. So that was well done. Vilosa is getting great sustain and great tone here. Even though it is a quieter dynamic, these are long bows that she was just holding. And so playing a little bit closer to the bridge than we would think, like she is here, slightly past halfway, is a good choice because we can use a slower bow the closer we are to the bridge and that gives us the ability to sustain. So that's well done. We're hearing some poor intonation, some poor note clarity here, especially in half steps. We should never do what she just did, which is repeat the same finger, meaning play two notes in a row with the same finger, and especially in a slur like she just did, because one, it's a lot harder to be accurate going from one finger to the same finger, but also there's nothing other than the note change to give us clarity. So if we use an alternating finger pattern there, as she should have, that would automatically give us more clarity. Because the violist is reading here and doesn't know the notes well, we don't have good rhythm. But using the bow and the left hand to read instead of sometimes people just use the left hand is a good way to immediately start getting familiar with the notes. So that's good. We need to make sure in this double stop that we're hearing both pitches. We're losing the G string here, so just a little bit more rotation so there's a little bit more weight on the G string and we can hear that pitch. Really excellent tone here. You're also doing a good job of pronating and unpronating to keep the tone consistent across these long bows. So, nicely done.

So maybe take out the bounces and then he'll be able to better do the steps on the right beat, but the extra bounce isn't really necessary. So here he's doing a series of jump kicks again and I think his upper body could do a little bit of something have some kind of movement. His hands are pretty much in the same position as arms so maybe pushing them out pushing them up or just swinging them down closer to his waist by a side. So this part he did like a little squat and then he kicked his leg back behind him kind of bent. I would have to say this is really good. He did a good job staying on the beat. He got a little bit off at the end but he definitely tried his best to stay on with the timing so really nice bend. I think if this were advanced choreography the dancer probably could squat all the way down in time and get up but really good job holding his balance and being able to do the kicks right after. So here I could tell he's getting a bit tired because off the music and also it just it feels like it's starting to drag on a little bit. So one thing I would suggest is slowing down and going to more of the melody of the music not quite the the fast beats that he's been on just to give your body a break especially for a basic or even I think this could be intermediate class everything doesn't have to be at like the fastest tempo especially if there's music in there to go a little slower so he could definitely take his time and I think that would help to control his body a bit more and give it some better structure. So here he's doing some jump kicks again and I think he's just a bit all over the place. I think here counting would definitely help and then thinking about which direction you want to face and just staying in that direction until you're at a good point in the music or the song or your accounts to change into a different direction. So the dancer starts with just some jump kicks and I can see that he is flat on his feet and that is why I think he starts to get a little off the beat. So if he would go up on his toes, really bend those knees, he'd be able to bounce a little bit more. And the lower you are to the floor, when you're doing like fast work like that, and your knees are bent, you just have a little more roundedness to the floor, the faster you'll be able to move your feet. So here he's doing a good job kicking his foot out and then taking about three steps to face the other direction. So right now he's facing his left and then he comes back over and faces the right. And he has a little hunched over, clapping, really good eye contact to the audience. And then really just nice footwork right on the music. So good job here. So here he's doing a little clap and then slide back. It may have been better if he would have jumped back just to help with the timing, because I think the slide and the friction with the floor just kind of pauses him a little bit, so then he gets off the music. So I think either jumping or getting up on his toes when he goes back. Alright, so even here when he crosses over side to side, if this back foot was, the toe was up, he'd be, it'd be a lot easier for him to change position. So stepping full with the full foot on the front foot, right now it's the right, and then just having the toe up for the back leg. So you're able to shift your weight a lot easier and you're able to go faster because you're shifting your weight correctly.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He should also be twisting from his hip a lot. The movement seems that it's mostly his lower leg moving, but he should also be moving his hips as well. The dancer's right arm should be lifted higher here. It's too low on the angle so it would be difficult to see. So he needs to raise his arm. It's okay it's on a diagonal but on a higher diagonal. The dancer doesn't move his arms as far back when he's swinging them in the second jump as he did in the first jump. His second jump shouldn't be compromised in any which way in terms of range of movement compared to his first jump. So his arms therefore should be swinging further backwards. The dancer should have been ending in a strong pose. He was not meant to start a second basic salsa step forward and then what she eventually just fades out of here. After he did a basic salsa step, he should have been finishing in a strong pose of his choosing. That's what the choreography was. So in this sense, he didn't finish strongly or in the way in which he should have. The dancer is doing a good job of rotating his leg inward and also his foot inward. So that's a great range of motion there for his leg from his knee downward. Instead, the dancer should be scooting and jumping backwards with his left foot first. His left foot should replace where his right foot is, and then his right foot should be jumping backwards second. So his left foot should lead backwards, and then his right foot should follow backwards. So instead of both feet going at the same time, he should be jumping left, right, left, right, instead of both feet and both feet. The dancer turns on flat feet with his feet completely on the ground. He should be lifting his heels off the ground when he turns so that he can do the turn quicker and with less friction and be further balanced. The dancer is jumping with both of his feet at the same time backwards. So in this way, like he starts with both feet on the ground, they both enter the air at the same time and land at the same time. That should not be the case. He shouldn't be jumping in this way with two feet to two feet. The dancer should be bending his legs more when he lands from these jumps as a way to soften and cushion the landing. It's also good for injury prevention and it makes the movement bigger as a whole. The dancer has good movement in his shoulder here. He's moving his shoulder vigorously forward and back and shimmying them so that's great.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She definitely is able to keep up with the footwork, so really nice job there. So here as she got down, I definitely wish she could have again think about just the energy and using the space maybe push your body out to slide out out of the knee twist that she did right before into the floor just because it kind of killed the momentum of the the movement by just kind of sitting down and then going into the next part. So here, up to here again, staying on the beat of the music and executing every step. And then to land here with her body nice and straight, she's up on the balls of her feet. Her arms are extended out with very strong fingers and her eyes are looking straight forward. So again, really nice line all together in this moment. And here was another moment where I thought was really beautiful in her layout. Her leg is extended almost above her hip. The standing leg is very secure on the floor. Knee is slightly bent, foot is flat. The arms are reaching and extending out and her eyes are looking up to the ceiling. So just a beautiful line and picture in her body. So here, nice position, she's holding her body weight up with her left arm and her legs are extended out and her arm is reaching up in the air, so nice job there with this shape. So up to here, the music still gets a little bit faster. This is kind of more of a reggaeton section because you hear the bass and the drums. And she does a good job there. Again, I think her performance style could have definitely been elevated a bit more and just really gave a lot more to the movement. But she does a good job definitely in this moment where she lifts her, right now her right knee is up, left leg is on the floor, and her arms are extended up in the air nicely. So here, really nice job with just the release of her back down in a kind of second position plie with her knees bent evenly all the way down, feet are flat on the floor, nice space between her legs. So then she reached her back all the way down and her back is about flat, her head is low between her knees, so really nice job just using her energy and strength and flexibility there. So in the beginning, the dancer steps out, she extends her left arm out to the front, and then her right arm circles around. Just a really nice strong start. She really fills up the music with her arm movements and just stepping slowly and really commanding a very strong presence in the beginning. So here again, really great job, especially with the ending because it's a lot of fast movements and then there's accents for the donut. And on the donut, she's really hitting every mark in beats and then finishes really strong. This final position with the arms extended out, eyes are straight forward. Most of her weight's on her right leg with the left leg slightly extended. Again, really nice lines, clean lines in her body. So really great job overall. So here as she transitions to a much faster part of the song, I do kind of wish her energy would have elevated a little bit, but again this is a really nice example model of just what the choreography should look like. And then as a dancer you kind of want to add your extra elements to it, your own personality and style to the movements. But here she's definitely able to change the dynamic to go along with the music. So up to here, really great job. Everything is done exactly to the correct beat of the music. She takes her time, and she really makes sure to give each step all the time and energy that it needs. So here in the turn, this is one moment where I noticed she had really great control in her body. In her turn, even though her feet are flat on the floor, her knees were bent, so that it just kind of allowed for a nice level of stability that you don't always see. So she's able to turn really softly and really take her time in the turn and then land perfectly to the side.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So in order for him to recover from himself falling, he would have to engage in the core and over grip the holds. This will not be very efficient of the climber as he will have to continue the rest of the route. The climbers are starting at a one-hold start, meaning that both of the hands will be placed in the same hold, meaning that the climber will have to pinch the hold, and this means that the climber will place the fingers at the top and the thumb underneath to generate pressure on the squeeze. Now once the climber has been able to grip the hold tight, then the climber will be able to apply his weight by leaning back. The climb will start until the climber gets to place his feet on the wall and is no longer on the mat. If the climber was going to try this again, he needs to make sure that he applies the toe towards the foothold. This so he can apply accurate pressure and continue to press down on the hold even when making the reach out left. In order for the climber to make the move out left, this one, moving the left hand to a pinch hold, he needed to engage his core to be close to the wall. And he does this by pressing down on the foot that he has transferred the weight over to by extending the right leg. The right leg being extended, this is called being on a flag.

This is what he's attempting to accomplish by turning the heat down, turning it back up. He's attempting to prolong the life of the milk mixture while steeping for three to five minutes. Now he is ready to serve his milk tea so he grabs his saucer, his spoon, and his serving cup or mug. All that he is missing is a fine mesh sieve to strain the tea leaves from the milk mixture. His flame is high here so that you can see that he is attempting to boil his milk mixture. He will want to gradually reduce that heat or stir the milk mixture in order to prevent it from boiling over. In executing this recipe, you could add the tea first or the sugar first. Those steps are interchangeable. Here he is adding his milk, which appears to be whole milk, into the pot. It is already pre-measured in the cup that he plans to serve his milk tea in. This is an appropriate way to measure the milk tea. However, I would like to see a liquid measuring cup so you know exactly how much you're going to be adding to your pot. Here you can see that he obviously produces this recipe quite frequently because he has a good working knowledge of controlling his heat and stirring the mixture so that it doesn't scald at the bottom or risk boiling over. You can see here that he comes back and adds more black tea leaves, about half of a teaspoon. This is why I always recommend using measuring spoons when you are executing a recipe. Then you're not eyeballing it or guessing at how much actual ingredients you're putting into the recipe. You can see that he cuts the heat up to medium-high to hopefully bring his liquid milk mixture to a simmer. To begin the recipe, he grabs his equipment, which here is a saucepan or pot. As he pours the milk mixture through the sieve into the small cup, you can see that he has an expert knowledge of executing this recipe. This is a very difficult task to do well without spilling the milk all over the saucer. And as you can see here, when he cuts the flame up, the liquid is closer to boiling over. And as he cuts the heat down and gives it a stir, the milk mixture immediately comes down. Here he adds one teaspoon of black tea leaves. This is For this recipe you could add anywhere from a teaspoon up to two tablespoons for the one cup of liquid measure. That is dependent on how much tea flavor that you want, how much caffeine that you want in your milk tea. So that is a personal preference. Next he adds his sweetener, which it appears to be granulated sugar, and he adds two spoonfuls, most likely this is two teaspoons, also an appropriate measurement for this amount of liquid, which appears to be eight ounces. He lights his gas to a medium-low it appears and then puts his pot on top I would actually light the flame after I have the liquid in the pot", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

That's a correct musical decision. We heard some muted percussive sounds here. This is because we can see that some of the fingers are actually playing on top of the fret bar instead of in the middle of the fret, and so we're not getting a full vibration out of the string. So the guitarist just needs to make sure that even when you're in a very close finger position like this with multiple fingers on the same fret or adjacent frets, that you're still playing right in the middle of the fret so you can get that good vibration out of the string. In this descending scale, we're hearing a bit of a mute quality to the tone. This is because the left hand is just a hair behind the right hand. The left hand has to be actually slightly ahead of the right hand rhythmically so that the string is already fully depressed by the time it gets plucked by the right hand. And if the string is fully depressed by the time it gets plucked by the right hand, we will get a clear tone instead of a slight mute to the tone. Really excellent rhythm in this section. The guitarist did a great job of bringing out volume wise in order to emphasize this suspended leading tone. Whenever we have a suspension harmonically emphasizing that is a really great musical technique to make the music interesting. So it was a great musical decision. This is an excellent example of how to extend your fingers for a large interval, like this minor third on the guitar, without contorting the hand. We see that the hand is still flat, or straight, against the fingerboard, and all these fingers are still perpendicular to the strings, which is excellent. The thumb is in the back of the neck, right behind the middle finger, which is great. And this is a beautifully balanced handstand, which is exactly how your left hand should look when playing classical guitar. It's perfect. Excellent rhythm through this first phrase. I felt the pulse was very nice. We hear a bit of a twang here. We can see that the note being played on the B string with the second finger of the left hand is not being held down properly because the finger is not centered over the string, which is causing a buzzing to come from the string. So we want to make sure that our finger is, our fingertip is right exactly centered over the string. The guitarist did an excellent job of tapering out volume-wise to the end of this phrase to a cadence, so it's a great musical decision. We heard that some of these harmonics that were just played did not fully speak. This is because the left hand wasn't accurate or quick enough. In order for harmonics to speak, you have to be touching the string with exactly the right pressure. If it's too light, it won't speak. And if it's too heavy, it's going to be muted. So it was a bit too heavy, and also it was a bit too late. The finger was not in the correct place soon enough. So just more accuracy, slightly faster moving left hand, and the harmonics will speak. We can hear that the lower notes of this measured strum, rhythmically measured strum, are slower than the higher notes. The guitarist needs to use a little bit less weight, a little bit less pressure on those lower strings, so that his thumb can move quicker across those strings and that it can stay in rhythm. We're not hearing the higher strings in these strumming patterns. The guitarist needs to make sure that he does not lift finger P up on the right hand too soon and that he completes the strum so that we can hear all six strings. The guitarist did a very nice job here of crescendoing to the high note on that arpeggiated chord. It's a great musical decision. When doing this strumming pattern, we need to make sure that we're hitting all of the strings that we intend to strum with pretty much the same volume because right now we're mostly only hearing the lower strings so we need to hear a little bit more of the higher strings so we can get the full chord. The guitarist is doing an excellent job of playing on their fingertips. We look at the first and second finger on the left hand, and we can see that there's a nice natural curve to them. He's playing right on the fingertips. This is excellent. The guitarist is doing a great job here of bringing out the melodic line that's on the higher string and letting these just repeated harmonic notes on the middle strings just act as a sort of harmonic atmosphere and not playing them as loud. So it's a great musical decision. We're hearing a lot of twang come from the low E string, which is tuned down to a low D right now. That's because the guitarist is not getting good enough contact with his finger P, his thumb on that low string. So we need to have more contact. And then because we'll have more contact, we don't need to actually pluck. It's hard. So a softer pluck with more contact will create the resonant tone that he needs to make this sound beautiful. On the hammer-on that was just attempted to be executed with the second finger of the left hand, we noticed that the hammered-on note did not speak. This is because the string did not go all the way down and the finger did not come down with enough force. So in order to play that hammer-on correctly, we need a little bit more force from the finger and more accuracy when placing the finger down. When the guitarist in this pattern that he is playing here gets to the top strings and then turns around and strums down, he needs to make that motion faster. He needs to anticipate that motion because right now we're hearing a small slowdown in the rhythm when he goes to strum. So he needs to make sure that he focuses on these transitions from alternating plucking going up to a strum coming down, make those transitions quicker by anticipating them. We heard a muted note here. This is because the second finger was not securely holding down the string to the fretboard. Ideally, we have to have the string making full contact with the fretboard, otherwise it will not vibrate. If it doesn't vibrate, we don't get sound. The guitarist is doing an excellent job here of keeping this accompaniment pattern softer and shorter than the lyrical melody on top. It's a great musical choice. We're hearing a little bit of nail sound on the higher strings. The guitarist needs to make sure that they're getting more contact of their nail on the string, meaning more nail surface area on the string so that we don't hear the nail sound, which is the nail scraping against the string.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So he's got a bat hang. So he runs out of feet. Uh, he's got this huge hole. So he's able to use the, the rubber on top of his shoes, kind of toe down on the tops of his toes and catch his feet here. So that way he can kind of hang below and it kind of takes all the way to his arms up. So he's able to kind of just slink down these holds, uh, to finish down below. Here doing a really good job when he's staring at the feet, really looking at where he's placing them. So kind of staying actively engaged on his movements and what he's moving, not just blindly reaching or placing feet. Also it'd be really easy for him to do kind of a, maybe a foot swing. It looks like he's on two good holds. And this is a pretty high foot, like kind of above his waist. So he's doing a good job of walking through and kind of showing that flexibility and better to keep your feet on than swing off and have to re-get your feet onto the wall. You can see he's starting from a relatively good position. The only thing I think I would clean up is this right foot. It looks like it's kind of just hanging out. So it's not really aiding in him going up. It's not maybe taking anything too drastically away from either, but he could just have a little bit more tension there. And that's going to translate to more power up the wall instead of this foot kind of hanging off and kind of pull him away from the wall. So here he kind of cuts feet a little bit, looks like he doesn't really get into position, looks like maybe he gets blinded by the fact that it's a huge hold and just decides to kind of jump for it. And here we can see he's doing a good job getting opposite opposed. So he's got left hand on, right foot on, and he's kind of smearing this left foot into the wall. And that's going to kind of let him dry from that left foot, smear it into the wall and kind of push himself up. And then he can kind of drive around this left hand to reach the right hand up.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Once again I do like that the head, the chest, the body is moving quite close to where that standing leg is so that helps us really keep the ball down because as we're striking through the ball we're not going to follow through and go up or hit the underside of the ball as we reach for the ball so we're able to really maintain control of the ball in terms of keeping it lower and not raising the ball over the crossbar or too high. So good position, like how the player is also utilising his arms to rotate and maintain his balance as he strikes through the ball. Again, just looking at the outcome, so player is really hitting the target quite consistently. Right leg is returning slightly back behind the left, which means maybe slightly leaning back you can see from his body position after the follow through. But in general, player is hitting his target and being able to move his feet and regain his balance after the strike, which is positive. Again, he's commenting on angle of approach, so you see 45 degree angle, which is what we'd like the player to do. Lighten his feet as he's approaching the ball, looks at his target, then looks down at the ball, fully focused on where he's going to make contact with it to maximise the outcome that he's aiming for.

Felly mae'n ymdrech iawn i'r chwaraewr atal y ball os ydyn ni'n ei ffwrddio gyda'r pwll dre. Here again, non-kicking foot stepping to the ball. You can see the toe is pointing towards the middle of the goal. This is generally through the angle of approach that he runs. Potentially if we're looking to aim for this left side of the goal, we may want to turn his toe a little bit more. The placement in terms of its relation to the ball is good. It's going to allow us to rotate through the ball and bring the ball back to the left side of the goal. Once again, just comment on the angle of the placement foot through the straight leg, through to the hips and the chest. Really the player is able to open up his hips and chest using his arms for balance out to his side. Again, really maintaining focus on the ball. You can see from his head placement and where his eyes are focused on, we're really maximising on where this right foot is going to strike through the ball, which is what we recommend. ymlaen, felly'n eithaf cyfathrebu gyda'r cyfathrebu o ran y lle y mae'n ei ymwneud \u00e2'r ball i'w mynd, hefyd fel y syniad o ddarlunio'r dyddiadur, felly wrth ei dilyn trwy, yn y dyrfa o'r ball, oherwydd bod y chwaraewr wedi'i ddarlun trwy ei llwybrau a'i byd, mae'n gallu dod yn \u00f4l y llwybrau drech yn ogystal ag y ddrech, heb ymdrechu allan neu ddod yn \u00f4l gyda'r effaith ddiweddar y ball, felly bydd hwn yn helpu'r chwaraewr yn dilyn unrhyw ddarluniau neu'n dilyn unrhyw gweithiau nesaf os yw'n gwneud y dylunio'r targed neu'r gofalwyr. And just looking at final action, outcome is pretty much in the intended area that he was looking to strike. You can see the player is maybe slightly leaning back through the follow through action. So at the next level, potentially as we're striking through the ball, we would be maybe a little bit more up straight, but the player obviously is able to follow through with his right leg and then be able to bring his right leg back alongside his left, which means that the player is not particularly losing too much balance through the strike. So he can maintain the quality and accuracy of how he strikes the ball. and just commenting on the follow-through action you can see here the right leg follows all the way through the ball relatively in the direction that the ball is traveling and this again helps us with power and control you can just see a little bit from the non-placement foot that the player is leaning slightly away to the left and back but the player is very you know in a decent balanced position you can see where his non-kicking foot is in relation to his head and his body relatively in control of what he is looking to do using his arms again to kind of maintain the balance throughout the action Again, just looking at angle of approach. So angle of approach is again at a 45 degree angle based potentially on the outcome as to the target. So he's looking to aim for this left side of the goal. Maybe we can start a little shallower, but the angle is good. It's just gonna really depend now on how we place our non-kicking foot and the ability to rotate our hips through the ball. He's looking at initial placement of the non-kicking foot here, the left foot. You can see because the player is aiming for the left side of the goal, the player's not fully stepping his left foot too far forward because that's going to allow him to really bring his hips around and his right foot around. If anything, maybe his angle of approach could be a little shallower so as he plants his foot, his toe is more pointing in the direction he wants to go. This just allows a little bit more rotation through. But in general, the player's in a decent position, good space between ball and the non-kicking foot. He's adjusting his non-kicking foot to be able to rotate through. Again, I also like this angled position from the standing foot all the way through to the hips, through the chest. And then the next step obviously is bringing his knee forward to bring his body forward. But this initial position, arms out to the side, opens up his hips, opens up his chest. And again, the back leg, the right foot that's going to come through in the back lift is bent and ready to now exercise the strike and come through the ball. and repeating on some of the actions from before you can see as the leg the left leg plants to the ground it was straight but as he brings the right leg through you can see the knee start to bend and move towards the ball which brings us a little bit closer to the ball and in control you can see again because of the angle of approach coming from there it's easy for the player to open up his hips bring his right leg through bend his knee present the inside surface of the ball and you can see the player is making contact generally with the middle of the ball and striking through the the center of the foot which maximizes the control that we have and would like to see the player on contact with his body slightly further forward you can see the player is leaning back slightly so this means that with our contact is just maybe gonna go through and up which is potentially going to bring the ball higher or we're not going to maximize the contact with the ball for the cleanliness and accuracy of the strike ac edrychwch ar y canlyniad penodol, felly mae'r chwaraewr yn dod at y targed yn eich ardal ymwneud \u00e2d, a gallwch weld bod y chwaraewr yn ymdrech yn ymdrech, nid yn ychydig, mae'n dod \u00e2'i gwaeth i'w gydnabod i ddod allan i ddod allan i ddod allan i'w gydnabod ei gydnabod, felly, yn unol, yn dda iawn, seqwenaeth o weithiau o'r chwaraewr hon. Again you see here as the player has made contact and follows through you can see quite clearly as the player strikes the ball you can see his leg really follows through in the direction he intends the ball to go. This maximises the control that we can have over the ball because we are striking straight through the ball rather than just making contact and withdrawing our leg. Also generates more power from the backswing to the follow through. I do also like as the player is making contact you can see his left leg again has gone from that straight position bending his knee forward which then brings his body closer to the contact point with the ball. So this maintains a little bit better balance also means that his body momentum is now going forwards as opposed to leaning back which can help us keep the ball at a lower trajectory rather than the ball going high. I also like to see the standing foot so where the ball was to where the head is you can see the head is close to the direction of where the ball was so that just means that we are able to maintain balance and control over the shot. I just want to comment here. So obviously the outcome is the ball hitting the inside of the goal to the right. So the outcome of the goal is positive. What I do like is from the players follow through, the player shows that he's maintained his balance through the action because he's able to bring his right leg back alongside his left with no real problem and maintain his balance after the shot. So this means as the player is moving through the action, he's in good control. He's got good balance with his non-kicking foot for the ability to be able to bring that striking leg, the right leg back down to the ground easily. On contact with the ball, you'll see that the standing leg, the left leg starts to bend. So it goes from a straight leg and then bending forward into the shot. This allows the player to be mobile and agile as he strikes through the ball, get lower through the ball. You'll see that the right leg is turning to present the inside foot to the ball and he's striking through the middle to low part of the ball. He's standing for his toe, he's still pointing in that direction. So based on the contact with the ball, the standing leg, where the hips are facing, we obviously are looking to hit this inside right of the goal. You'll see that the player is still slightly leaning back. This is from the placement of the non-kicking foot being slightly behind the ball. So we do end up reaching a little bit as we make contact with it. Again looking at the follow through action, so again players in a good position, got good balance between his plant foot, you can see his body has moved forward, so slightly behind the plant foot, so maybe slightly further forward would be ideal, but again you can see the follow through action with the right leg is very much going through the line of the ball into the intended direction that we want the shot to go, so the player is in a good position maximising control and power. Again, just looking at the outcome of the penalty, so you can see that the player, based on everything that we presented with the non-kicking foot, the hip placement at the end of the shot, the follow-through, the ball is reaching its intended target. You can also see that the player's right leg, after the follow-through, returns back alongside his body. Because he was slightly leaning back, you can see his right leg has gone back behind, so a little bit of momentum going forward, the ball was lost, but generally, because he's able to bring his right leg back alongside his left, the player shows good balance through the action during the strike. Just looking at the contact point between the player's right foot and the ball, you can see as the player brings his right leg towards the ball that his left leg goes from being in this straight position to then bending his knee to bring his body closer to the ball. Also see that the player's right leg, based on the angle of approach, is able to really open up his hips, get this knee bend in his right leg, open up his body shape so he's able to present the inside foot to the ball. By using the inside surface of the foot with the ball maximises the surface area, potentially can give us more control as we're looking to create accuracy with the shot. You'll see the non-kicking foot is still pointing in this direction and his hips have rotated through in the same direction as his standing foot, which is good. So everything is really directing to the ball, heading towards the right side of the goal as we look at it. Also like as he strikes the ball, you can see his arms are out away from his body so this provides him some extra balance as he strikes through the ball. Again, just maximising outcome, so hitting the inside side netting of the goal. So outcome is positive, you can see again the player is slightly leaning off to the left, having to bring his right leg back behind his left as he strikes. So maybe a little imbalance after the follow through, nothing too significant, but again if we can potentially move through in the direction of the ball, this may be generating more power and also allow us to set up for potential rebounds in a game if a goalkeeper makes a save, if he hits the post, so we potentially look for the next action. Here I like now that the player is turning his left foot slightly away from centre so it's pointing slightly more towards the left. This is going to really help with his whole rotation of his hips through the ball and his follow through action. So you can see he's in a good position. Again, distance between the ball and the foot is good, maybe slightly more can open up a little bit more room but not a big problem. Love the angle of the body from the straight leg planting to the ground, hips open, chest open. Again, using his arms as balance to really open up wide and that allows that flexibility and mobility of his whole body to come through the ball. Again, the back lift is good with the right leg bent, getting his foot set in a position to now come and rotate through the ball. Again, very focused in on the ball which is going to help us really maximise the contact point. And just looking at angle of approach, so we see this 45 degree angle that the player is moving towards the ball. Focus is very much on the ball. Player positioning himself in an area where he can now move towards the ball step and rotate his hips through in the direction that he would like to make the shot. So he's looking at the placement of the non-kicking foot based on the direction the player would want to go. So non-kicking foot, because the player is now looking to come across his body to the left of the goal, you can see that the left foot places and now turns more towards the left than originally pointing towards the right. So he's trying to provide a different direction and open up his hips more to come back to the left. Because he's coming across his body, it's natural that the foot will be placed slightly behind the front part of the ball. So this is a good position because this is going to now allow our hips to rotate more through the ball and come around to the left. And I do like the position of the player from the straight leg on the initial placement. You can see he's really opening up his chest, his arms are out to the side. This is going to give him the freedom to really rotate his hips through the ball and get as much power and control on the strike as possible. See the contact point with the inside of the right foot with the ball. Non-kicking leg, you can see there's a slight bend, so he's gone from that straight leg position to bending in, which brings the body closer to the ball. We are still leaning slightly back. This is partly due to the player's placement foot and really trying to open up his hips to turn to get the ball travelling in this direction over to the left. You can also see that the player is making the adjustment on the angle of the inside of the foot to make contact with not the direct centre of the ball, but the position of the ball slightly off-centre to the right, so then he can really follow through in that line in the direction that he wants to go. I just want to look at the follow-through action. Once again you can see the player is well balanced through the plant foot, the left leg bending, bringing his body relatively straight upright from that plant leg. The follow-through leg, so he strikes the ball with the right leg, you can see that the player follows through pretty much in the direction he intends the ball to go. This again generates good power from the back lift to the follow-through, also adds extra quality control in terms of accuracy because it means that we are striking all the way through the ball, not making contact with the ball and then stopping. So it generates more control to help direct the position of the ball. I do like that the player's focus is very much on moving forward through the shot. This is just going to help him maintain his balance and to keep the ball from going too high during the strike. So looking at the follow through action, so you can see again the player is aiming for the left side of the goal and you can quite clearly see the striking leg, the right leg follows all the way through the contact point of the ball and in towards the intended direction of where he wants the ball to go. Again the only thing potentially is the obviously non-kicking foot was slightly turned more to the middle of the goal as opposed to the left. So to get the ball coming all the way to the left side of the goal, the player is now really rotating his hips around and that brings our right leg across our left slightly, which will lead to maybe the player leaning slightly off to the left. But I do like again the body position, the head position in terms of the standing foot, the player is maintaining decent balance and control as he follows through the strike and the head is in a good position for him to be able to really control the velocity and the angle of how he follows through the ball. And just emphasizing angle of approach to the ball is important. So if we can get this 45 degree angle towards the ball, that's going to help in terms of stepping to the ball, getting our hips rotating through and opening up our chest to strike the ball. Again we just look at the outcome so outcome is top corner pretty much inconsistent with where he's been looking to strike. Again just want to look at his balance after the strike so you can see the player is leaning away and slightly back. He's going to regain his balance because his footwork is good, brings his right foot back but if we can get some slight variations we can get the player hopefully moving more in balance and more in line with the strike of the ball. Again, contact point with the ball on the right foot. So you see the left leg has gone from this straight position, bending the left knee as he makes contact with the right leg. This allows the player to move forward through the ball. The angle of approach and the way that he presents himself to the ball allows him to open up his hips, present the inside of his right foot through the center of the ball. And we can again see the non-kicking foot pointing towards the intended direction he wants the ball to go. Hips are facing in the intended direction he wants the ball to go. Inside foot facing the direction of the intended target. So the player is kind of in a very good position to maintain a control and quality over the shot to go. It's looking at final outcome of the shot so again intended target outcome is good. You will see as the right leg follows through and then comes back you can see it goes back behind the left leg. This again is just a result of the player slightly leaning back so as we strike the ball in this direction I'd like to see the player moving his body more kind of in line and forwards through the shot as opposed to striking through and leaning back but just a slight nuance in the shooting technique. The outcome is good, the balance of the player is good again because he's able to bring his right leg back alongside his left and maintain balance so just a little small nuance with the position of the body leaning back slightly. You see the player is planting his non-kicking foot closer in line with the ball than the previous one. This will just generally allow for the player to really be able to strike through the middle of the ball. So the standing foot is good. Maybe a little bit more space between the left foot and the ball will just allow for a little bit more rotation through. But based on the direction the player wants the ball to go, you can see the toe pointing towards the right, hips facing in that direction. It's not too much of a problem by being that close with the technique the player has. What I do also like is as the player steps towards the ball, you can see that the body is in a relatively straight line from the kicking foot to the chest, leaning slightly back on an angle. So this is a good position for the player to really open up his chest, open up his hips and bring the striking leg, the right leg, back before he starts to now execute through the ball. I also like that the player's focus has shifted from the goal to now getting his head and his eyes focused on the ball. So now we can maximise the contact point between the foot and the ball before striking. Again, just commenting on the angle of approach, so again, an angle of approach is good. So we wanna be on that 45 degree type angle just to allow us to really step alongside the ball. And then this allows us to really open up our hips and rotate our hips through the line of the ball with our striking leg in this place, the right foot. Also, I like the player's focus. After looking at the goal is now right back on the ball and getting his body moving in the direction. The change for the player as he is looking to strike the ball to the left of the goal as we look at it. So now the rotation of the hips goes a little further around to the left so he is trying to rotate it into the direction he wants the ball to go. You can also see the position of the kicking foot, the right leg, so he is now on a slight angle hitting slightly off centre to bring the ball around to the left as opposed to striking straight through the line. If you strike straight through the line obviously the ball is going to go more to the middle of the goal so you can see the adjustment in the body position. You can see that the left leg, the standing leg, is bending in but because the player is looking to open up to the left the player is now still slightly leaning back as he goes through to try and open up his body to get the ball moving to the left. So we would want the body to maybe move slightly further forward despite him trying to open it up just so he is more in line with the position of the ball. So here you see the player is now changing his intended outcome to the left side of the goal but you'll see that there's no genuine change in his angle of approach. It's maybe a little shallower but we're still approaching the ball from an angle which is what we'd like to see. Again this allows the placement foot to go alongside the ball and will just allow us to open up our hips, open up our chest to be able to rotate our hips through the ball. And just commenting on the angle of approach, 45 degrees. Only thing potentially is if we are looking to strike the ball to the left, there is a potential that we could maybe shallow the angle a little bit, maybe start a little bit straight to the ball. This just allows us maybe to plant our foot a little bit more turn towards that direction so we can really strike straight through as opposed to coming across the ball. So just looking at the player's starting position in terms of approaching the ball to strike. So you'll see that the player is working on an angle to the ball. So by not coming straight onto the ball, this will allow the player to step into the ball and be able to rotate his hips more freely through the direction of the shot. And just looking at a follow-through action, so as the player follows through straight in the direction of the intended target, which is obviously this area of the goal, to the right of the goal inside the right post as we look at it, you can see that the player now is getting into a well-balanced position as his left leg bends and comes forward. And as he follows through, he brings his body more up straight so that body momentum is helping transfer into the ball. But you can see a good follow-through action in the direction that he wants to go, and then using his arms as well to maintain balance as he goes forward and through the ball. You see again the players initial placement of the plant foot is in a good position. You can see the toe and the heel effectively lining up with the front and the back of the ball. So this is obviously from a dead ball situation where the ball is from a stationary position, not a moving position. So this is a good placement for the non-kicking foot. A little bit more room potentially between the ball and the foot can allow for a little bit more freedom to strike through but the player has good technique so it doesn't make a huge amount of difference. You can see the non-kicking foot is pointing in the direction that he wants to go. This also controls the direction of the hips in the follow through through the ball. You can see again the player has a good angle from his plant leg as he makes contact with the ground to his chest, opening up his chest, arms coming out to the side to maintain balance and really open up his chest and hips to strike through the ball. Again you can see the right leg preparing to come through the ball, so swinging back, knee bent and then we're really focused down on the ball and this is going to maximise our ability to make good contact as we strike the ball. Again, just looking at the preparation of the ball strike, so the non-kicking foot stepping to the ball. You can see the toe is pointing more central, so if the player is intending to aim over to the left, we potentially would want to maybe turn it slightly more in that direction. This just allows for that rotation of the hips to come through into the direction that we want it to go. Sometimes between the foot and the ball, we can maybe open up just slightly more, just for that more mobility and freedom through it. But in general, the position of the player, plant foot, straight leg, hips and chest open, using his arms for balance out to his side, striking leg bent and back in the back lift to be able to follow through in the direction of the ball. Everything's in a relatively good position as we set ourselves up. Again, just looking at contact. So here the player is bending his left knee into the strike. You can see that the player is leaning back slightly from the contact point with the ball to the body to the placement of the head. So we'd want the body to maybe be a little further forward in line with the initial placement of the ball just to maximize the power and the momentum that we generate through the ball. The player here is very much controlling the direction of the pass, utilizing the inside of the foot, placement of the non-kicking foot, rotation and final placement of the hips as he strikes through the middle of the ball to goal. So the player is not really struggling for matching the outcome based on leaning back slightly. But if we want to maintain full balance and control, I would like to see him maybe slightly further forward as he strikes through the ball. Once again, just looking at the angle of approach for the player to strike the dead ball. So you see that the player is approaching the ball from a slight angle to the side. What this allows the player to do is step alongside the ball and it allows the player to freely rotate his hips and his striking leg through the ball which will generate more control and more power. So the player, I also like, is making contact and looking at where he is intending to strike the ball. So he's assessing the situation and then his head will come back down to the ball before he makes contact. We just want to look at the placement of the non-kicking foot as it lands next to the ball. You can see again it's relatively, let me just clear that one, clear. So the toe is relatively close to the front of the ball, heel slightly back, so maybe a couple of inches further forward would be better. We'd recommend a little bit more space between the non-kicking foot and the ball. This just allows for that ease of movement of the striking leg here, the right leg through the ball. But in general the player is going to open up his hips and strike the ball through. I like the position of the body in the initial phase, so straight leg, body is starting to lean to come forward but he's opening up his chest, opening up his hips. So that's a good position, good visual for you. And then the striking leg you can see is now as he plants his left leg, starts to come back, bending the knee, which is now going to help him rotate through the ball. And his focus is very much on the ball, which is going to help maximise the contact point between the right foot and the ball. and it's looking at the follow-through action for the player so the player strikes the ball, ball is traveling on upwards directory based on the contact point with the inside foot and the ball probably slightly lower than center you can see the direction and the power of the shot very much helped and controlled by that follow-through action you can see the the right leg following through kind of in that direction of the intended target of the ball and the players continues to really rotate his hips through the ball which is going to help the ball potentially spin a little bit more towards the the post in inside of the goal you can see the player is slightly leaning away from the ball his left foot was a little close to the ball as he strikes it so he's really exaggerating that hip rotation to come through the ball which is forcing his body to lean away and slightly back I would maybe look to recommend that we try and get our body as upright and moving forwards in the same direction as ball if possible because if we're leaning away that maybe affect our next action in a game situation if the ball hits the post or the goalkeeper makes a save Again, just looking at the follow-through action for the strike. So the player has approached the ball, made contact with the ball and now you can see that the non-kicking foot is still pointing a little straight. So you can see here the right leg striking the ball is really following through in the direction that he intends the ball to go. But his right leg is starting to come across the line of his left leg. This is due to the initial placement of the non-kicking foot. If we turn that slightly more we can maybe reduce this crossover effect a little bit. It doesn't affect this player's outcome, he still hits the target with decent control and power. But you can see because he's now coming across his body with his right leg, the body is now starting to lean away to the left. So I would recommend that as we strike the ball we want to try and get as much of our body moving through the line of the ball as possible to generate the most amount of power. I do like that the player's body and head you can see is very much in line with the non-kicking foot. So that does mean that he's moving his body momentum forward and through so we are getting good control and power over the strike. Again, just looking at contact, again we go from this straight leg to bending the left knee into the strike. Again, this just helps us bring our body slightly closer to the line of the ball. You can see the non-kicking foot is maybe slightly turning back more towards the centre, but the player is obviously angling his right foot at striking the ball, so he's able to now hit through the line of the ball in the intended direction that he wants to go. So he's in a decent position, locked ankle, knee bent, getting his body kind of towards the ball, helping him with the contact with it. You can see his hips are starting to turn, which will help him maintain that final direction of the shot. What we do like here in terms of the follow-through action, you'll see as the player strikes the ball with the inside of the foot, the player brings his leg all the way through in the same direction as he wants the ball to travel. So this allows, the follow-through allows to generate more power and also more control because it means that we are striking genuinely through the ball rather than making contact with the ball and stopping and relying solely on the contact point with the ball. I do like that the player's momentum with his body through this bent leg allows the body to become a little bit closer in line with the contact of the ball. So he's being able to shift his body weight through the strike as opposed to leaning back. And this also will help us keep the ball a little bit lower rather than allowing the ball to travel higher by reaching for the ball and hitting a lower contact point. He's looking at the initial placement of the non-kicking foot. Again, we'll see the toe and the heel are pretty much in line with the front and back of the ball respectively. So this is an ideal position. His initial step, you'll see that he maintains this straight leg, straight body type of position, which is what we like to see in striking the ball. You can see his arms are out to his side, which is just opening up his chest, opening up his hips. This allows for good rotation through the ball with the right leg. As he plants his left foot alongside the ball, we've got good distance between. We can see the right leg with the back lift here, knee bent. So this just allows us the flexibility to now strike through the ball. I also like that the player's focus, you can see with his vision, is very much on the ball, which again is going to maximise contact between foot and the ball as we strike through it. and it's looking at the contact point with the ball. So you can see because of the placement of the non-kicking foot being quite, looking more pointing towards the middle, we have to adjust our contact point between the inside of the foot and the ball. So we're hitting it slightly off-center to the right so we can follow through in the direction that we want the ball to go. Because he's coming across his body, you can see that the body is leaning slightly backwards and away from the ball. That's in his attempt to really open up his hips and get the ball traveling to the left. So as we step into these strikes, we'd like that left knee to bend and to potentially bring the body a little bit closer to the line of the ball. So a little bit further forward than where we are right now. And this can be dictated by the placement of the non-kicking foot, the angle of it, the distance of it from the ball, just to help our body move through the strike at the end. Here the player approaches the ball and plants his left leg as he's striking the ball with the right leg, plants his left leg to the side of the ball. Normally I would recommend the player places his foot closer to the line of the ball so that the toe is in line with the front of the ball, the heel with the back, especially from a dead ball position. So foot's a little further back than the ball than we would potentially like, maybe a little close to the ball. You'll see the direction that the toe is pointing in is towards the inside right of the goal, so that's the intended target and this will allow the player's follow through to move through in that direction. You'll also see that the player's body shape is relatively straight from leg through to his chest. By having this kind of structure in place with the body allows the player to open up his hips and be able to strike through the ball with good rotation. Again, just looking at outcomes, so players hitting his intended target to the left of the goal as we look at it. You can see the final position of the body is slightly leaning back and to the side, he's having to bring his right leg back behind his left to regain that little bit of balance that maybe we lose due to the placement foot and knee follow through crossing over a little bit over to the left. So if we can get the placement foot correct then hopefully we can bring our body through the ball and be able to regain our balance with our feet shoulder width apart together.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She whipped her head around really quickly and I think she did two turns so she turned to the back and then spun again in place and then got herself around. So really nice job getting that turn because it's really quick and difficult but she got it on beat. So great job here. Here's where she picked it back up and remember the steps. When she stepped forward she was stepping on the balls of her feet nicely. So really great job so far. So other than the part where she forgot the choreography, she did a really great job just getting through everything and staying on beat. And even when she messed up, she kept her body moving until she remembered what was next. But really great job. So here I just want to highlight how she changed direction, so changing the way that she was facing, and really made it look simple. And I think this is why I would even put this up as a more advanced Salsa because of all the different direction changes and all of the different movements that she's doing. Nothing is really repeating, so it does add a level of difficulty for a learner. So here in the beginning, the dancer does a great job. When she first kicks out, she's able to keep her balance and get all of the steps correctly and on the correct beat. And then in this position, she steps back and she's up on her toes, legs are nice and straight, arms are reaching out. And she was able to just stop herself and then she's going to keep moving. But great job so far. So in these four movements where she kind of pushes her arms out and kind of thrusts her hips a little bit and kind of bucks her head, really nice job there just really articulating in the back and in the legs to really hit the beat on that movement each time. So up to here, nice job. The only correction I have is when she swings her arms around, really want to straighten those arms out so it looks like a, almost like a wheel going around. So really straighten those arms out, but otherwise, great job up to there. So up to here, really great job. Again, everything is on the correct beat. The arms are full out, her movements are sharp, and you can see every single movement. So really great job to hear. At this point is where she forgot the dance, so she's I think trying to figure it out. But I do like that she kept moving, so that's a really good sign of a great dancer, that even if you mess up, you still keep your body moving, so you're not just standing still.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This keeping this right side against the wall is important and key as for the climber will have an easier time when reaching upright to the next hold. The right hand is placed as a pinch, meaning that the fingers are in one side and the thumb is pressed on the other. The climber will be able then to generate power by pressing on that thumb and leaning on the hold in order to sustain it. Now the left foot as he was going up for the reach was the one that he was using to stand up and after the hand is being placed and the right foot will lose touch with the foothold. In this case it's important that the climber knows how to place his feet correctly. The left foot was then placed on top of the big edge, this one where the climber can completely put his foot against it. But in this one the climber is generating power where he slides slightly out and it's mostly relying on the ankle area. Here the climbers are starting at a two hand hold start. Once the climber gets to place the feet on the wall and is no longer standing on the mat and once he gains a secured position then the climb will start. As we can see the type of hold that the climber is brushing off with the chalk sock is because he's trying to bring the integrity of the hold back. And this because over time the holds will collect sweat and chalk that will be compressed onto the hold. So he does the brushing to take away anything that has been collected on the pores as well as applying chalk onto the hold. This so that he's able to sustain a better grip. The climber was able to reach the left hand up to the next hold while engaging on the pull. When the climber needed to apply force onto the foot down below, the left foot has slipped off from the hold. This was due to the poor placement of the left foot. The climber originally has placed the outer edge of the foot, thus distributing the weight over the entire edge of the foot, which was not accurate as climbers are able to shift their weight and apply pressure, mostly relying on the toe box. In this case, the climber has slipped out of the hold because once they brought the knee into the wall, the foot had rotated inwards and resulted the slip out of the hold. It's important the climber when making placement of the feet he glances down at the foot that is being positioned. In this case the climber glanced over to make a left foot placement to an edge that sticks out and places the outer edge of the foot against the hold. This you will have to create pressure by pressing down on the hold. As we can see the climber is placing his hands into two different holes, the right hand being a sloper, meaning that the climber will have to place the right hand open handed and create friction by placing the fingertips and leaning on the hold in order to sustain pressure on it. On the left hand, we can see that the climber is staying to a jug, meaning that there is a positive entrance for the climber to place the fingers behind it and the climber will be able to sustain pressure by closing the grip, placing himself below and pulling on the hold by curling the fingers.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

As mentioned earlier, a smaller diameter saut\u00e9 pan will allow or will better allow the mixing of the egg using a rubber spatula to form those soft curds, which is what you want when making a classic omelet. The omelet is removed from the pan and remains flat. A typical omelet would be either folded in half or rolled. If you're folding the omelet in half, your filling would go on half of the omelet and the other half folded over the filling. If you're rolling an omelet, you're going to roll the omelet and place it onto a serving plate. Cut a small cut in the top of the omelet about 3 inches long in the middle of the top and your filling would be added into that slit that you made. Here the omelet has been flipped over using the metal spatula. With a classic omelet, there is no flipping of the omelet. It is allowed to cook in place in the saut\u00e9 pan once those curds have formed. You can also notice browning on the exterior of the omelet, which is something that you're trying to avoid with a classic omelet. The preparer is adding oil to the hot pan, which the omelet will be cooked in. Now while oil is certainly acceptable when making an omelet to use as the fat, the typical fat used is clarified butter. That is butter with the milk solids and water removed. Here, the preparer is cutting a small amount of onion or shallot and adding it to the seasonings in the small metal bowl. Typically, vegetables used for a filling on an omelet would be sauteed first and then removed from the saute pan. After the vegetables were cooked, then the omelet itself would be made and the vegetables added in at the end. The preparer has selected a metal spatula for the preparation of the omelette. The tool that is typically used would be a rubber spatula, so that once the egg is added to the pan, it can be gently stirred with the rubber spatula until curds of the egg form. The egg is being added to the hot pan and there is a distinct sizzling sound when that egg is added. This is an indication that the pan is too hot. When making an omelette, you want a low to medium-low heat so that the egg slowly cooks, forms nice curds while stirring, and then is allowed to just cook on the low heat. That low heat prevents the exterior of the omelette from browning, which is the goal when making a classic omelette. The egg has been added to the small metal bowl and is being mixed with a spoon. What would be recommended is that the egg be the first thing to be placed in the bowl, and then either a fork or a whisk or chopsticks be used to whisk the egg really well. What you're trying to accomplish is a homogeneous mixture where when you cook the egg, you're not going to see any streaks of egg white separate from the rest of the egg during the cooking process. Here the preparer is adding a small amount of oil to the small metal bowl with the onion, chili, and seasonings in it. The egg will then be added to this bowl. Oil should not be added to the egg prior to cooking. Here the preparer has selected a larger diameter, shallow walled pan to make the omelet in. A typical omelet is made in a saute pan that is somewhere between 6 to 8 inches in diameter, with sides of 1.5 to 2 inches tall. Here the preparer notices that the flame has gone out underneath the pan where the omelet is being cooked. And she's attempting to light that flame. In all honesty, that egg is finished cooking. Any further cooking would be overcooking the egg itself. When the omelet was flipped, there did not appear to be any liquid. And even if there was a slight amount of liquid, it would be cooked the minute it hit the hot pan. Here, additional oil has been added to the pan along the edges of the omelette. When making a classic omelette that you roll once it's complete, you can sometimes use butter to help that omelette release from the pan and roll easier. In this case, it's really not necessary to add additional oil. Here's some green chili has been cut up and added to the small metal bowl with the onions and the seasonings. Again, this would typically be sauteed prior to making the omelette and then added in at the end of making the omelette. The preparer has selected a small metal bowl and is adding small amounts of seasoning to this bowl. Now the typical seasoning for an omelette would be just salt and pepper. However, based on individual tastes, other seasonings and spices can be utilized. Here the pan has been placed on a lit burner. However, none of the omelet ingredients have been prepared. What this is going to end up doing is creating a pan that is too hot so that when the egg is added, it's going to probably overcook fairly quickly.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

They seem a bit stiff and as if they are one sort of 2D element. And again, we want to, in a lot of these dance styles, be more 3D and more dynamic, so have more breaks in the body so that we could see the shift in the hips and the waist and seeing those types of isolations happening while the dancer is moving to the music.

She's definitely dancing with a lot of not only energy, but a lot of vigor. The dancer continues to travel a great deal and take large steps going forwards and backwards. These steps are equidistant. She's traveling just as much forwards as she is backwards, and she's traveling a great deal of ground in both. So again, her spatial awareness is very good, and her usage of space is very good. The dancer has really good rhythm. She is pausing on counts four and eight. So at four and eight she is in stillness not moving which is really wonderful which is very consistent with salsa dance. Moving on counts one, two, and three. Pause and count four. Moving on counts five, six, and seven. Pause and count eight. The one common for improvement that I will give this dancer is that she's been dancing with the most time with her hands in fists so her fingers are a bit tense. She can relax her fingers so that they're more graceful and elegant as she moves. So instead of tucking her fingertips underneath her fingers to make fists, she could extend her fingers outward. The dancer is doing a good job of straightening her arms completely and they are at the same angle. They are completing the same angle in this linear line. So really great arm execution here. The dancers eye focus is very great here as well. We see that her eyes are looking or aiming to look straight ahead at the curtain in front of her and it's leading the turn. So her eyes and her head is already looking at the curtain in front of her. It's already looking to the front of the room, even though her body is still facing the left side of the room. So it just shows that her head is initiating the movement because her head is already arrived there before her body is. So that's a great spot for her turn. She'll be able to finish the turn completely because her head is already there. The dancer's hip movement is very good. As we see here, she's stepping down on her right foot and when she does that she's moving her hips the opposite side horizontally. She's moving them to her left so she has this oppositional nature between the foot that, or oppositional coordination between the foot that she is stepping on and the way in which she's moving her hips. And that's awesome that she is moving her hips horizontally here. The dancer continues to have great hip movement. Her hips are moving horizontally right and left shimmying as she's bringing a foot forward. So the step is not only concentrating on her feet, she is moving her hips and she's moving her hips double time. So in each foot step that goes forward she moves her hips twice. So when her foot comes forward she moves her hips twice and when it comes back she's also moving them so that's really great. The dancer has a great usage of space. She's traveling very well when she's doing these horizontally traveling steps to right and left. She's covering a great area of the room. She is traveling really far and that's really great. It shows that her footwork is also articulate. Her arm movement is also very good and well coordinated because right here as we see she is stepping downward on her right foot once again but she is raising her left hand in the air. So she is using both arms, both her left and her right. Left is higher than her right and the one that is higher is the opposite than the foot that she's stepping on. So that's great coordination there.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This forces the player to have to swing around the ball and not through the ball as we would like. The player is not getting himself set, he's just hitting the ball. This isn't a penalty situation.

The player has shot the ball into the corner, the window of the net, really good area which makes it very difficult for the goalkeeper to save. Players place the ball down, move back, so we've established a run-up pattern. This is good as it helps the player go through the process of striking the ball in a logical order. Players not kicking foot is too far away from the ball, pointing in the wrong direction. The result of this is a strike where the players swing through the ball, so out and around, instead of going through the ball as we would like.

However, the climber seems to be ready now as he's lowering his center of gravity and now keeping the left leg extended. This is called flagging so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. And since the next hold is at reach, the climber must perform this move dynamically. The climber was able to make the right foot placement over the large hold, this one being a jug, and places the ball of the foot towards the edge of the hold. Quickly the climber sends the left hand over to a match over the same lip of the hold, and because the opening of that jug is over to the right side, the climber must lean back on the opposite direction to create pressure and secure the grips. Thank you. As we can see the climber quickly started swinging over to the right side and sends the right hand over to the last hold. He's keeping the left leg extended and helps him balance out the move. The climber was able to jump over and make the placement of the right hand to the hold that reach However, his main areas of support right now are his grips and since they are Vertically placed the climber is going out on a swing opening up to the left This is called a barn door so the climber must recover on the move by tensing the body holding tight onto the grips and Soon making a foot placement to recover the move The climbers main areas of support at this moment is his left hand and his right foot being in place For the grip the climbers leaning back to transfer over the weight to the grip and High release the left foot out of the foot placement to transfer the weight to the right foot being in place while making that hand placement for the right hand The climber was able to make the position of his feet at a high foot placement after cutting feet and he keeps the left leg to be with the knee pointing out. This is so that he is able to keep his hips square and close to the wall when pressing onto the feet. As we can see he's ascending onto a jug bringing both of the hands onto the same hold. This is called matching and now it's glancing over to the next holder reach. Quickly while gaining momentum on the transfer, he then performs a second move consecutively with the right hand over to the next holder at reach. When the climber performs the same hand to be moved consecutively on the same stance, this is called bumping. As the climber had only two points of contact previously, he sends the hands and the feet to come over to a match and now it's glancing over to the next hole that reach. He must first gain a civility over his movement as he has performed this dynamically. The climber was able to perform the next hold at reach and as he was pushing the right toe towards the wall to boost the move and gain direction, he now after sustaining onto his left hand grip, he is now keeping the right leg extended. This is to gain balance over the move. As we can see the climber, after securing the right hand grip, he lowers his center of gravity by extending the arms to transfer the weight to his grips and glances down to perform a foot switch, sending the left toe to come into place at the jug before releasing the right foot from its place. The climber releases the left foot from the jug and this is called flagging out. The climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place and as well as balancing over for the next move at reach. In this case the climber had moved the left hand over to the right side of the jug so because of both of the grips being on to the right side of the hold the climber must keep his center of gravity in the opposite direction leaning back to create pressure at the grips. The climber has brought the left hand over to a match at the orange hold. This one being positioned onto the left side of the hold has said it's a jug. And the climber right now is bringing the right toe to come into position over the jug so that he's able to release the left foot. He must do this quickly so that he doesn't lose balance of his center of gravity on the wall. The climber, while sustaining on the mat, we can see him lowering his center of gravity. This is because he is keeping his feet to be fairly high to bend the legs as he is glancing over to the next hole that reach. What he will have to do is press down onto both of the feet, not only to gain height, but by pressing onto the right toe towards the wall will help him push to gain direction to the hole that reach. The climber was able to send the right hand over to the next hold at reach, this one being a jug as he's able to slide the fingers behind the lip of the hold. Jugs are known to be positive grips because they don't require much energy to sustain on them. However, the climber in order to make the reach, he has performed a lock off, which is the climber making a very tight pull up and bringing the grip close to his shoulder or chest, while gaining height on pressing on the right toe. For the climber to bring his center of gravity close to the wall was done by him keeping the left leg extended, this one being on a flag to transfer the weight to the right foot being in place, but brings the left toe to come to press against the wall so that he's able to bring his center of gravity close to the wall when performing the move. The climber is starting potentially at a step up start or sit start. The step up start is when the climber uses the foot to bring his center of gravity close to the wall by pressing onto the foot being in place. And when the climber is no longer standing on the mat, then the climb will start. If it was a sit start, the climber will place his hands and feet towards the wall and will have to raise the hips off the mat in order to transfer the weight to the placements. Sit starts usually add a grade of difficulty to the climb due to transferring the weight from being seated to the placements. So the climber is starting at a two hand hold start and as we can see, the hand is being wrapped around the edge of the hold, this one being a jug. So it is a positive grip since the climber is able to then lean back to transfer the weight to the grips. If the climber is no longer standing or sitting on the mat, then the climb will start. The climbers feet out in the air, this is called cutting feet and the climber is trying to engage into the core while swinging out and pedaling forward engages the core to tense the body as well as bringing the feet close to the wall so that he's able to recover the move. The climber is performing in a series of pull-ups and this is so that he's able to gain momentum mostly lowering his center of gravity to then sprint over to the net to the holder reach. The climber has moved the left hand two consecutive moves. After he had moved once and does the second one immediately while being on the same stance, this is called bumping. As in pointe, the climber glances down at the feet, especially if performing a foot switch, being that high up of the wall. In this case, he's bringing the left toe to come into place at the edge of the hold before releasing the right foot from its place. When the climber performed the right hand placement, his feet had come off the wall. When both of the feet are off the wall, this is called cutting feet. The climber, in order to sustain the movement, must engage on the core to pick up the feet since he is so close to the mat. This encends the climber's glancing over at the wall to make sure he makes a foot placement soon to recover the move. The climber releasing the right foot and extending it in the air. This is called flagging out and it's mostly worked as a tail so he's able to transition his center of gravity underneath his grips as he had sent now the left hand to come over at a match at the last hold. The climber must demonstrate control and stability over sustaining the match as well as his body position in order for the climb to be completed. The climbers first move is sending the right hand over where the left hand is. When both of the hands are in the same hold, this is called matching.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Yeah, so as he settled in, he made a lot more. He made four or five in a row at the end. I'm going to give him an eight, the release, the footwork, the follow-through was all textbook.

But with each kind of static reach, his whole body kind of pulls away from the wall, as he's not in the best position and isn't actually balanced anymore. So he doesn't kind of really hold the position he kind of pumps in and then he hits it and almost falls back So I almost feel like he's he's pulling too much into it So he doesn't kind of know how to like kind of dead point use those momentum to kind of hit these holes and conserve energy Like he pulls into the position, but then almost pulls too far into it. It's not sustainable So that way when he actually does then let go of the left hand to bring it up here You see him kind of fall back away from it and have to kind of catch himself again. So it's like You know, it's almost like he's taking it a couple extra maybe half a foot or inches beyond where he needs to be and so he's actually kind of he's getting so far into position that he's actually kind of Coming back out of position in the opposite way So there's kind of that sweet spot of balancing out in the middle. So I think he needs to find that balance point where he can You know take his arm off and stay in the same position and not fall backwards or not have to catch himself You He's quite locked up, but he does stay opposite of pose. He's got that right foot on, left hand on. And when he does make this, he is pulling up the arm, but he does drive through that right leg. This left foot looks like it maybe just doesn't look like it's doing anything to help. It doesn't look like it's doing anything to hinder. I almost wonder with how far he's twisting, if he committed to playing this foot out, if he could come in and twist and do a little bit more of a twist lock. Twist that chest into his bicep and forearm and just provide some extra stability, especially as he kind of pulls up and does this high, high move to this pinch with his right hand. Make him a little bit of extra stability and just strength and power in that position. And then move a little bit slower and just overall just grab that hold maybe slightly better. So yeah, finishes the route, but it seems like he's almost pulling, you know, he finds, he gets into position, but almost pulls through the position, so then he's off position again. So he's now kind of in that sweet spot of like really owning the position. He almost like wants to get so high on the hold that he pulls himself out of position. Now once again, he's like really locked off on both these arms So it looks like he's kind of pulling himself higher and higher and as he pulls himself higher and higher that hold gets lower and lower And so he's almost pulling himself up. It'll be almost better to kind of relax that out and kind of pull through and use that momentum and kind of carry him to that next left hand Here we can see he's utilizing both feet. He's got his knee sticking out so he is driving his hips close to the wall which is really good. It's really allowing him to pull straight down through the holds. So I like this, kind of maximizing his hip position to drive his hips into the wall. So I like his starting position. Even before he kind of gets his feet on, he's really hanging off one arm on this hold. I think that means he's probably moving his right hand up first. So he's really figuring out how to sink down into his feet and be able to pivot around these feet and keep his arms straight. So overall, really good position. He's really kind of getting himself set up to really drive into those feet. Here he kind of goes He doesn't get takes he doesn't really spend the time to get opposite pose So he's got his right hand out here moves it to this orange jug But he does that off of a left hand left foot and you can see his right foot already picks off You can see his hips kind of pulling away from the wall So it's kind of why it's important to get opposite pose or bounce out or somehow keep tension It's because the moment he kind of takes his right hand off the hold. I mean, it's all the holders so good to him He's not really thinking as technically and how to maximize his Position on the wall, but just when he kind of let's go that right hand just that whole body just kind of dips away And it's definitely gonna have to cost him some energy to pull himself back in at the hold weren't so forgiving like this right hand looks Massive, you know if he was going to something that was a little bit more less positive or smaller He's got a lot harder time staying in position Like this next move, um, you know, he is kind of pulling up so he still is pretty actively engaged on both hands He's not really Relaxing into it, but he is doing a good job of taking his knee from back here And then driving it to the left So that way he's kind of applying this force straight down to that hold Not that but it's kind of bringing his hips close to the wall and bring his hips and the whole just torso up higher Into the left to make this next move and then once again, you know opposite of pose You know, he's got that right hand on left foot on In a nice kind of square open style. So he should be able to kind of stay relatively balanced and then get the next hold Kind of seems like he can maybe just jumps on the wall a little too fast. So he's really hanging off this I think that he could have Placed his hand and kind of sunk into it and said he kind of places a foot on Jumps into this right hand fold. So it seems like he While he's in a good position now Seems like maybe a little bit extra energy and exertion that you wouldn't need to do and almost feels like a little bit sloppy to start and that he is Maybe climb a little bit. Yeah, just an interesting interesting move not like amazingly good not amazingly bad just It seems like there's an easier way to start it and that just be to pull on and sink into the hole instead of Kind of jumping on latching especially when they're this close to the ground", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

His arms are as well as tapping as well and then just keeping a really nice light movement throughout his body. So here as he crosses over, his arms, the movement gets a bit more exaggerated, a little bit bigger to match the music. Also just increasing the energy as each step progresses. He does a nice crossover. I think he could have just went on and rotated his body to the side so his upper body isn't still facing the front. And then he could also be able to use his space a little bit more and travel a bit more with the cross. But really nice job just for each step that he does between standing in place, stepping side to side, and then crossing. He's elevating his energy so it just makes the movements bigger and bigger as they go on. So here he's starting just stepping in place, but he has a bit more energy in his upper body than his lower body. And as you see, he will increase his energy throughout. So I do like how he's starting off really just mellow and slow, keeping the correct feet, with them coming slightly off the floor, knees are slightly bent. And again, just a really nice upper body movement that's happening. Here's his turns. Really nice job getting the turns all the way around, spinning around quickly, as well as having some nice structure to his arms as they are held up right at his chest to also help him spin around and just make it look really clean as he gets around. Here as he crosses over, he does kind of a, instead of just crossing front and back, he kind of crosses over then steps back and side and front. So again, yes this is basic, but he does add a bit of an extra element to it with the crossover that he does. And here as he steps out, his movements get a little larger, so he's stepping out nice and wide. This heel could come off the floor just a little bit, but the knees are bent well and again nice motion in the arms.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

That's okay, it happens, but it should just be clear to the dancer when she is going to be ending the routine so that she doesn't throw anything away. It seems like she was anticipating after that hip circle and arm circle step and while she was moving her arms and hips in a counterclockwise circle that she'd be ending the routine there. I'm not quite sure if she was anticipating continuing with the salsa step that's going forward to the center and backwards to the center. So she just needs to be clear about when the routine is ending so that she can end strong. The dancer makes a great line here. She's making a diagonal line from her wrist to her toe Her leg is straight with energy outward her arm is up with energy outward her wrist is flexed here but her finger says energy as they They are shooting outward. This is really great execution of this positioning She's bending her right leg here Which helps and allows her left leg to really get to the side of her and further out on the diagonal With energy and so this is a great execution Her right leg is bent similar to how her left arm is bent. So both sides of her body are Working together with her right arm straight and left leg straight as well as her right arm bent and left arm bent They're mirroring each other here The dancer is pulled all the way up on her toes. Her heels are off the ground. This is really wonderful She's very much so easy on her toes easy on her feet So she's exhibiting really good weight shifts from forward to center to back to center because of this Weight distribution to be on her toes The dancer uses her left arm, we see it in front of her in the eagle view as well, to swipe across this space. However, she only does this on the fourth time, she doesn't do it on the three prior, so it's a bit inconsistent whether she forgot that the choreography was supposed to be that or she wanted to do that but didn't do it till the very end. Either way, if she was gonna swipe her arm, she should make it more apparent. Again, it's very graceful and that's wonderful, it's fluid, but she could strain her arm at some point, it doesn't have to be strained the entire time, but eventually while it's going up, if it reaches a straight position at some point so that it seems purposeful and not like it was a mistake or something she forgot. This motion that she's doing with her hips can be even grander. She's circling her hips around and around, which is great. She can have even more energy making that step just larger and grander. As well as when she's circling her arms similarly around and around counterclockwise, she can make this step bigger by using her shoulders more so that her arms are having a bigger circumference and the circle that they're traveling within. The dancer can use her shoulders and her hips more here, horizontally. They could be shimmying and shaking to the side to make the dance step more energetic and dynamic. She's doing a good job of engaging her chest. She's pumping her chest forward and back, but she could also be using her shoulders and her hips here. The dancer has great focus here. Her eyes spot directly in front of her. So when she does this revolution, this turnaround, she ends straight forward because her eyes are focused there. So the rest of her body lines up with wherever her eyes and her head is pointing toward. The dancer starts a routine exactly when she was supposed to. She is on the music, she does not miss her cue. And this is a great start for having her start that very first step without any hesitation and in the correct direction. The dancer's weight shifts are really great here because her weight is on her toes. Her heels are off the ground, they're lifted off the ground, so that is helping her be able to shift sideways both to her left and her right. The dancers wrist is flapping a bit here. She's very graceful in her arms and continues to be but she can use more energy in her hands so that her wrist isn't flapping and loose there. She just has to extend her energy through her fingers and she can bend her wrist but at a less severe angle so that it's not making a 90-degree angle as it is here. Her arm is straight and her wrist points downward but so that it's at a more subtle angle for our mystery and her wrist points outward a bit instead of downward so that it's still not in a straight line but just so that her wrist has more energy. The dancer is very fluid in her arms. We see that her arms makes a straight line, but she also has a slight bend at her wrist. She brings it up on a curve gradually. She doesn't stick her arm straight out, but she brings it up gracefully. And this is going to help her with the rest of the routine in terms of being fluid.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I think her arms could have done something, maybe go up and maybe went out to the side. Even just a rotation in the arms and shoulders, just to give a little more movement in her upper body. So here, nice job getting the arm extended all the way up on both sides, as well as when she extended them out, they were out straight, as well as the toe tap is correct, getting just the ball of the foot on the floor. So here she steps forward, trying not to hyperextend and straighten that leg out. It should be slightly bent in the knee. And then also really stepping up on the toe of the ball of the foot and keeping the heels off the floor as she steps forward and back. So here's another place. I'm not sure if she's trying to see what is next or she's just confused, but just want to have a cleaner transition in this moment. So here she can definitely extend this leg out a bit more deep into that knee. So bend that knee a bit more. Nice job with the arm up. I think the eyes should be stretched more forward and less to the corner, but that's the main correction. So here when the dancer steps out, I definitely think she can use more of the space and really stretch her leg out and just take bigger steps in general. It just feels really small to open up. So here I'm not sure if she forgot what step was next, but I would say that could have been a much cleaner transition into the last step. So nice job getting the arms all the way up over the head, nice and round, and then also getting around. Again, make sure the heels are off the floor and knees are bent as well. And here she steps to the side again I think making that a much bigger step, wider step, definitely bending those knees to just really get into it.

Pulls on nicely, shows control before attempting to make his first move. So I really like the start on this one. And so now we're kind of back into the trouble point of this kind of violent foot swap. I think the move for this would actually be, with how his arms are on the pinch, I think the move would actually be keep the, don't be opposite pose. Because I think staying square on and kind of being able to drive. So I think the move is, don't kind of do this twist in, because you're climbing on these pinches where you have to be a little more square on. So I think leave the left foot here, but then reestablish the right foot, if you can, onto the starting pinch, maybe even do a heel hook. And then maybe try to static the move. But I think the secret in this move is not how he's doing it, because I think being opposite pose is just going to encourage a heel, a foot cut. Because you're going from so far left to so far right. So it's just asking for those feet to kind of swim around and kind of lose that tension. If you can keep the feet on, that'd be one thing. But if the feet are more angled, you can't really get that downward pressure on them. So I think this is a case where getting maybe a hand-foot match on that right side, getting the heel, doing something, or even just having your left foot on and driving from left hand, left foot, but almost let your foot kick in like a moon kick. So that'd be like, this is your foot, letting it swing one way. And then when it swings the next way and it's coming up on its upswing, that's when you jump and that leg carries momentum upward.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Really loading up the feet. The problem isn't getting to this first hold. The problem isn't getting to the first hold, but moving off of it. And so I believe it is a bump move where she's going to hit it probably left-handed and then bump up to this other pinch. Or also you got to skip that first hold. But she seems to be spending a whole lot of time trying to hit it and pull on it. But I think the bigger option would just be skipping it and going in between good holds. I think here's the kind of actually stay stuck in this position where she's trying to pull through this hold. I think she needs to get her hand swabbed, but same foot move. Get the left hand here and then do kind of a coordinated pull to kind of hit this higher pinch while keeping her right hand low on the good hold. I wish she could just go immediately up to the pinch and drive kind of over that foot.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I could see this done with any younger child, even just the elderly, because the movements are very simple. She's staying light on her feet. She's using her arms, using her hips, keeping her eyes forward to the audience. Just a really nice overall performance. Really great example. So here again another nice moment she is a really simple step where she's just stepping her foot forward but you do see her hips moving a little bit she's allowing her feet to move her hips I do wish her arm would reach out just extend just a little bit more so that way there's a little more action with her body going out since everything's right now is really up and down but that's about it everything else is really nice So my one note would be just when she's stepping forward for the salsa, I would just maybe bend this front knee just a little bit so it's not so hyper-extended. But really nice job staying up on her toes and then also using her arms to accentuate and help her hip movement and her upper body movement. So this may be the only time that I can notice we see that she made a mistake. I think she just took an extra step with her left foot, but otherwise like a pretty flawless routine that she's done. So here she kicks her right leg up to do a little swivel around and then she plants it down on the floor and does a little hip body roll. But I just want to notice when her body is nice and straight up. I think she may be a little bit off on her toe which is good if you can go to relev\u00e9 that would be nice but just keeping her balance while she swivels that leg around and then plants her foot to the floor was really nice. From the beginning, the dancer starts with the salsa and sliding out to the side. One thing I noticed is she's just really light and just airy and just moving very freely and just nicely in the beginning. So really nice energy to start with. So here the dancer just did a jazz square where she steps cross back side and she kind of holds a moment and then step cross side front. And she does a square around herself and then she jumps out in this side lunge. So her right knee is lunging bent to the side. This toe is parallel forward and this leg is out. I would turn that toe out just a little bit more towards the back. But those arms are nice and extended out. Her eyes are to the front. So if you took a picture right now it would be a really nice picture moment. And she does give that pose on the beat really nicely. As well as her jazz square was really clean into this transition. So one thing this dancer does really nicely is she spots when she turns around. Her head was looking forward, she whipped her head around to spin around really a nice clean turn that she did with her arms up over her head, so really nice turns. And as she's stepping side to side, I noticed a few things. One, she is staying up on her toes, which is really nice. And she also has a really nice control of moving side to side. So when you think about energy and how it may be hard just if you're moving this way and then having to go back and then back again, you may feel like you want to fall, but she's keeping a really nice balance and just kind of conserving her energy enough to spin around, to turn to the other side, to walk, and then turn. So she's doing a really good job balancing out that energy so she doesn't move too hard or too fast and spinning around nicely. And it doesn't look like she's sliding on the floor, but she's nicely, her toes are planted nicely on the floor. Even though her heels are up, she's still planted nicely.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I would encourage the dancer to plie throughout this whole movement in order to have more agility, but also to have more precision. And in order also to have more precision, I would encourage them to engage their core. I would encourage this dancer to think about really digging into the ground and really how can they pivot on the balls of their feet and even include their hips, because they're often they're working really hard through their upper body and through their legs, but oftentimes the hip articulation is missing. But this would improve the overall look and feel of the dance and make the top half of the body feel not as disconnected from the lower half of the body, and also increase the increase the agility meaning that it wouldn't look as disconnected. I would encourage a dancer to plie before they start this fast step movement, right before they begin this, so they're ready to go and kind of move really fast and with agility. I would encourage dancers to think about the parts of the foot that they're hitting for this step front, step back, this kind of moment that happened right here before this next, before they did this body roll, really thinking about the different parts of the foot articulation is super important. I would encourage the dancer to really have more breath throughout this and to really think about when they're practicing the steps to practice it as one big piece. Right now it feels kind of choppy, so thinking about those transitions between steps is super important to increase the dynamic quality of the movement in this advanced choreography. I would encourage the dancers to put as much energy in this arm here that they do in this opposite arm. This is what we often call a dead arm because this arm is working really hard while the other one is a little bit more stiff. So making sure to balance out that energy that they're putting in their upper body.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The climber starts when the climber's feet are no longer on the mat and by now the climber had brought the left foot to come into place and extending the right leg with the foot not placed on the foothold. This is called flagging out so that the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. And now since the climber had pressed onto the left toe, we can see how he is bringing the hips close to the wall in order to carry over the weights to the placements. If the climber was to perform this move again, it is important that the climber continues to apply pressure onto the left toe to not lose the foot placement and it is something that the climber just needs to be mindful when performing the throw. The climber performing the jump to the reach, we can see how the left foot has slipped out of the hold. This was a main foot placement for the climber when performing the reach as she will need to transfer over the weight to the left foot placement due to the direction of the throw. And in order for the climber to make the reach, the climber after gaining height from pendaling over and bringing herself close to the wall, the right foot would be the one engaged first to help with the direction of reach. The climbers shaking the hands will help to release any tension that has been built up when previously climbing as well as warming up the hands before jumping onto the climb. The climber sends the left foot as a karate kick over to bring it into place into a large hold. Now the climber was able to create pressure of the left toe meeting the hold and had placed it on the corner of that block where the ball of the foot is on the corner in the toe to be ready to roll over the hold when the climber gains height. Now as we can see the climber is swinging over her hand grips and leaning back due to pendulum over to gain momentum as she is preparing to commit into a dynamic reach. The climbers first move was sending the left hand over to the next hold Over to the left where it's positioning the hand by the palm facing away from her To apply the grip on the lip of the hold This is a jug that is upside down and so the climber right now in order to create pressure is closing the grip at the lip and sending the elbow out to apply pressure to the grip and and Sustaining to that hold the climber immediately had made a foot switch and drops the left Foot from its place where the right foot now had come into place As we can see the climber is starting at a one-hold start where she places both of the hands onto the same hold. This is called matching. By placing the hand to be wrapped around the lip of the hold, this is a type of hold that's called the jug and is mostly seen on beginner climbs because they don't take a lot of energy for applying the grip when transferring over the weight.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You'll notice that they're all over the hold, but their arm is just way too straight. So in order to catch this, you need to be in more of a 90 degree lock-off situation. You really need to be pulling down on it, so the climber just needs for their hips to be a lot further up the wall in order to jump into a lock-off position. I also think that both hands need to be incorporated onto this hold. The climber is set up super well to just be able to gun it with both hands. I'm not saying that it can't be done with one hand, but it would definitely open up the odds a bit if the climber jumps with two hands.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet, especially when having to make a toe switch, which he's bringing right now the right toe to come into place at the foothold before releasing the left toe from its place. The climber is securing the left hand grip. He sends the right hand quickly to come into a match as he continues to apply weight over the grips. Now the climber must demonstrate control and stability over his position for the climb to be completed. The climber was able to make the left hand placement over to the last hold and he did this by releasing the left hand from above the right hand on the same rail and had continued to press down on the feet to continue to have his stance be static from the lower body as he rotated his shoulders or shifted over to the left side to make that left hand placement. Now the climber places the fingers above the flat edge of the hold and brings the palm to come in contact with the outside area of the hold. He must build friction between the fingertips, skin meeting the hold in order to have a catch to sustain the grip and the climber will be able to transfer over the weight once he secures the grip by dropping the elbow down. Once the climber gets to secure that grip and drops the elbow down, then he will continue to apply force onto the grip by staying low. The climber was struggling before making the foot switch and had originally found a way to keep the right toe to be unsurfaced to the very top of the hold. In that instance, the climber was able to maintain position to send his left toe to a high foot placement. This one being in a small edge, it's important that the climber look down to make that toe placement, as this one is crucial for the climber when making the next move. We can see right now that the climber was able to make that left foot application and now it's pressing down onto that foot, as we can see the right leg being extended and the right toe is no longer in contact with the wall. This is called flagging out and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place, as well as gaining stability and balance over the move that he is going to make. Once the climber gets to place the finger or fingers into the pocket, then he immediately sends the left foot that was out in space to come into a foot placement. This is because doing a pocket move, especially being underhand, can be very strenuous for the climber at this moment. So if he can ease it out by sustaining the weight on the placement, that would be better for the climber to ease out the transition of the weight being held by the fingers. The climber sends the right hand over to match at the jug. Now the climber extends the arms and has engaged in a pull up to send his right foot over to a high foot placement being on a large hold, which he will be using later on to stand up over the highest foot being in place. Once the climber has made that right foot placement, he has dropped the left foot from its foot placement and this time the climber is pressing the toe against the wall. In doing so, the climber is meeting the rubber of the shoe to surface the wall so that once he creates a push motion, he will smear so that the foot can stick onto the wall. And once the climber is ready to commit for the move, he'll push hard on that left foot to send over his center of gravity to the highest foot. The left foot will help him also to push and make the reach over to the right direction. The climber is bringing the left hand up to the ridge, this one potentially having the fingers curled behind the edge of the hole to sustain the small grip. The climber continues to keep the right leg extended, which this is called flagging out, so the climber continues to apply pressure onto that left toe and at this moment as he's making the transition also holding tighter onto the right hand grip being on the jug because the jug has the entry over to the right side, the climber must lean over to the left side in order to sustain the grip. The climber was able to make the left hand up in the reach, the very top of the hold. Being a jug, the climber is able to comfortably transfer over the weight onto the left hand, surfacing the lip of the hold. Now he's glancing down at the feet and it's important that he continues to apply pressure at the feet when making the foot switch. The left foot is the one that is originally being in contact with the hold and he's smearing the hold. That means that he is using the sole of the shoe by the toe to push down on the surface of the hold as it's flat by also bringing his knee inwards due to the foot being positioned in a slanted way with the outer edge of the foot pointing down. So the climber is bringing the right foot to come into placement, also the same hold but slanted on a different direction. So once the climber gets to apply the right toe in the sole area of the foot towards the hold, then he will apply pressure by forcing the foot placement and extending the right leg before releasing the left foot placement. Something to note is that the climber having the undercling placement, meaning the hand is coming from underneath the hold, is stronger when it's below his waist. And whenever it's above him, it's even harder to sustain even though it's an easy placement to make. So now the climber must release the left hand as it's the lowest one in order to make the next hold at reach. And right now the climber has secured his left foot being in place and the right hand being on a jug. The right leg is extended and this is called flagging out so he's able to transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place. Once the climber gets to release the left hand, he will be able to use the right leg to balance over his left foot when making the reach. Flagging helps the climber to keep in balance and also civilize the move. The climber is starting on a sit start and sit starts are difficult to come off from as it adds a grade to the climb. This is because the climber is placing both of the hands into the same hold. This is called matching and so he will be pressing down onto the grip by placing the fingers above the edge of the hold. And once the climber places the feet onto the wall, he will be pressing down on the foot placements in order to raise the hips. That way the climber once he is no longer sitting on the mat then the climb will start. Something the climber did well here was that he continued to apply pressure at the grips and wanting to continue to apply that pressure, the climber releases the left foot from its place and drops it down carefully so that he can continue to apply force onto the grips but the climber lowering his center of gravity as ideal so that he's not engaging on the arms and instead is just focused on transferring the weight to the grips. It is smart of the climber to bring the right hand from underneath the left grip, this coming into a match at the rail. The climber, as we can see, is only able to place the fingertips behind the edge of the hold, this almost being like a small jug and crimp together. So in this case, as the climber is sustaining to the very shallow lip of the hold, he continues to weight the grips by leaning back as his arms are extended. Once the climber gets to secure that right hand placement, he will be able then to rotate over to the left side in order to transition his left hand over to the last hold. this movement that the climber has made all the way up to the top hold at reach it's because he needs to move quickly as the underhand finger pocket it's not very sustainable and can't worn out the climbers grip. Now underhand clings usually are pretty strong because the climber can place it from over him and bring the underhand type of grip all the way past his waist when gaining height. As we can see in this view the climber has placed two fingers inside of the hold and most likely he's always in the climber should always place the strongest fingers in his hand in order to sustain a pocket hold. If it was one finger that's called a mono hold and ideally placing the middle finger or in this one the climber places the middle finger in the index finger in order to sustain the grip. As we can see he's also closing the grip in order to sustain it and in order to continue applying pressure the climber must always bring the elbow towards the core. The climber wants making the reach of the right hand to the hold. We can see the next hold in the sequence is finger pocket. So this type of small hold inside of the hold the climber will be able to slide a finger or two fingers into this small pocket. So in order to do this the climber will place the fingers inside of it and will have to close the grip in order to create pressure and sustain the fingers in place and the fingers will be curling into the hold. Now if the climber is only able to place one finger this will be called a mono hold. In the same way the climber will have to close the grip in order to sustain the grip. The climber making the first movement sends the left hand out to a jug. This is a jug because the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold. And the climber has to stand up over his feet and press down on the right foot in order to make the transition over to the left side.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She's looking in towards her right, which is the direction of her arm being raised. The dancer is meant to be having her weight on her right heel here It does look like that's the case, but it's not completely clear or as clear as it could be so she should be raising her right toes higher into the air so that is clear that her Weight is on her heel so her toes should actually be lifted higher The dancer has good arm action here. One arm is higher than the other arm and she alternates this right arm higher than left and left arm over right and she coordinates as well in that alteration. The dancer has a good range of motion here, moving her or twisting her left leg far to her right side inward. However, this movement could be improved if she also used her left hip and raised it here into the air. She should still keep her left foot on the floor, let's be clear. But while twisting her leg, if she also raised her hip, that would make the movement overall look bigger. The dancer is straightening her arm completely here. Her right arm that's raising the air is in a straight line, which is really great. She also has energy radiating out of her fingertip. In this position, the dancer's left foot should be crossed behind her right foot, and it actually is not crossed, it's almost next to it, and it should be on the other side of her right foot, so she needs to cross it over further. The dancer is taking really small steps here, forward and back, in this basic salsa step. She's not traveling very far and should be taking larger steps to start the routine using more of the floor. The dancer is completing a revolution or a turn with her weight on her toes and her heels lifted off the ground which is good. However, her heels can be lifted even further off the ground to make her taller in her verticality reaching higher towards the ceiling. However, the dancer can be using her shoulders more so that it's not just her arms moving but that her arms are moving as an extension of her shoulders also moving. So her shoulders can be moving up and down while her arms also raise. The dancer is also dancing flat-footed with her entire foot on the floor and her weight should instead be concentrated on the front of her foot on her toes and And while she's doing that her heels should be lifted off the ground so that she could have more mobility and change her weight in these weight shifts from going forward to back more easily and This would also help her travel more if her heels are off the floor so she'd be able to take larger steps", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

It's stopping his turn from gaining speed and making it very dynamic. He should be placed on his toes with his heels off the ground as if he's a little bit on a tippy toe so that he can turn around with more ease. The dancer is moving very flat-footed. He needs to articulate his footwork more and he can be doing that by standing on his toes. His heels should be pressed off the ground. Instead, his foot is completely flat or both his feet are completely flat on the ground. The dancer is also bending his arms very close into his body. He can make this movement bigger, extending his arm a little further outward before bending so that it's not such a closed-off movement. The dancers arms are almost rolling around each other Instead of rolling around in circles his arms should really be alternating up and down With one he does have one arm higher than the other but the pathway in which they're getting there is not correct He's rolling them in front of him in Circles instead of raising one up and one down and then alternating the other up and down There shouldn't be any rolling motion or circular motion there Or allow any circular motion forward at the very least The dancer needs more energy on his turn. When he's doing a revolution, he really should be whipping his head around. His head should be moving with great speed around to the forward. He is able to turn around, but he is not moving his head with as much strength as he would need to execute the turn better. The dancer's spine is a bit condensed here, especially since he is a decent height, he should be using all that he has as a resource. So he should be extending upward from the top of his head, and this would start from the base of his vertebrae at his coccyx bone all the way up through his entirety of his vertebrae should be extended. We see that his back is a little bit condensed here. His head should be in a straight line and that should be extended fully up. The dancer has a great deal of arm movement here, but he doesn't have much shoulder movement. His shoulders remain level in a straight line here, but his shoulders should also be used and raising. So whatever arm he has higher, right now his right arm is higher than his left, his right shoulder should also be lifted a bit. That would give him more movement, more engagement through other body parts and make the dancing more exciting and dynamic. His hands remain a bit awkward. We see his hands almost look cupped as if they're forming a circle and they shouldn't be enclosing in on themselves instead they should be, his fingers should be extended outward with some energy, relaxed but still having some energy. The dancer shouldn't be leaning his head over to his left as he is here His head should be aligned with the rest of his spine. It should be in a straight line right now His head is a bit curved on the line. His head should be completely upright. So even if his body Steps outward his he shouldn't have any repercussion in his upper body towards that sideways movement Only his feet should be opening to the sideways movement. The rest of his upper body should be completely upright and not tilted The dancer's hands are a bit awkward here. His fingers are all extended outward from each other. And while they're extended outward, they don't really have much energy. So they're tense in some ways, but also not engaged enough in others.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I believe this looks like a really difficult chord, but they've got that left hand balanced enough that everything is sounding really well. This is a really nice slowdown that they're doing that as you're playing each note It's exponentially just getting slower So it feels really nice and even Right here it starts to feel like it starts to rush a little bit and then that top line starts to unravel a bit and not become as clear. As always, try to practice slowly and isolating a certain line to get clarity from it is the best way to practice. I think the tempo starts to get here a little bit too fast for this player. I think if they slow down enough that they should have the technical ability, but right now it seems like it's faster than the opening section. This is another example of a way bigger shift, but they took plenty of time, and they were able to shift exactly where they needed to be. This is a nice extension of the left hand, again between all these beats. The timing is nice and smooth, so nothing is coming across as being too jumpy, but their first finger is now a little bit further back for this specific chord. Again, the player is doing a really nice job with striking each finger independently with the right hand. There's a lot of clarity and clear music making. The right hand here starts to become a little bit uncoordinated. The middle of each section starts to feel a bit compressed, so they're definitely rushing a tiny bit. But there's so many notes that I think it's a little bit more noticeable. Advice would just be to keep practicing slowly, so that in these moments where you're going fast, you really have an understanding of what your right hand is doing. The player gets off to a couple false starts here. I think just to make sure that they feel settled They can take me a little even more time before they start and move on to the next section This note doesn't sound as clear as the rest. I think it's a harmonic, so there's going to be a very light touch with the finger, and then make sure that there's a nice follow-through all the way through the very ending note. The player here has the right amount of weight into his left hand and it's coming across very clear. He's also very coordinated with his fingers and his right hand to be able to play the correct rhythms and sound very even. This descending line, the player could use their forearm rotation, like turning a doorknob, to help them get their fingers to be coming down faster onto the string as they're moving back. The player's right hand is doing an amazing job of really bringing out this top line, this melody, the top. It's kind of a different development section here, but a lot of really great clarity with his right hand. The player just slowed down for a nice musical effect. Imagine there's an end of the first section, so it sounded very nice and even. The slowdown was really nice and progressive, so it felt like a nice, complete ending. The player is doing a really excellent job with the right hand and figuring out how much weight they're using for each string. The lowest string, which is on the top, they're giving nice healthy strums with their thumb and the rest of the fingers are very well coordinated to have this nice kind of brilliant sound. The player just demonstrated a really nice shift where they shifted right in time so that there's no slides, there's no sloppiness, it was a very clean shift and the music was able to keep on going.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

It makes me think maybe she is left-handed. You can tell the elbow is kind of pulled out here because it's just the way the hand is on the ball. Let's get that elbow in. In fact, if she is left-handed, let's get that left hand behind the ball and get our right hand on the side. Again, I mean, looks like she's left-handed. You can see a little bit of a, you know, breaking of the wrist. Let's get this right elbow in, hand facing in, in fact, if that's the guide hand. But I, you know, she's shooting with two hands, and you can tell right here. Love that she's trying to extend her body. I would love for it to go straight up and come straight down. She kind of falls forward, and any of that extra movement, falling backwards, falling forward, right or left, can throw off the rotation and flow of the, and the pathway of the ball to the basket. Here you start to see a little lift here. I love this look. Look at that right elbow, how the ball's cocked back on the right hand. Looks like she is a right-hand shooter. Again, let's get that guide elbow in underneath the basketball. But much better looking shot right here. I mean, you can see where the ball kind of hits. It's really off to the right, and then it just kind of hits hard on the backboard and pops out. Here's her landing, you know, one leg's in front of the other, which is good, but you can see this right knee and ankle turned out to the right. We'd really love to see her whole body square to the basket. And let's hold this follow-through. Let's designate our shooting arm, hold that follow-through until the ball hits and either makes or misses. Again, pretty good knee bend, dropping of the hips, let's spread the feet. I love how she's looking over the top of the ball. Again, hand placement, we really need to work on that. And in this view, the ego view, after the release, again, she's really shooting with two hands. You can see both wrists go down. Ideally, you know, we want to shoot with one hand and have an offhand. When you get two hands in the shot, you just throw off that backspin and the ball just kind of being thrown up there. So again, let's figure out, you know, what hand you're shooting with. I would really recommend her moving in really close and work on form shooting. I love she's got a little lift here. That's nice. She takes a big step here with the left foot, and ideally, in terms of execution, you would love for the shooter to jump straight up and jump, come straight down. She's kind of leaning in and taking a big step forward. It's gonna be hard to do that when you're defended. That defender is gonna be in your space, and it's gonna be hard for you to step up. So, you know, execution-wise, we'd love to see her add the jumping and lifting to her shot. Here, the ball is in the air. We'd love to see her hold a follow-through. That arm, you know, you see here it drops. You don't even see a follow-through. So let's get that follow-through. That shooting arm looks like might be a right arm up in the air. Again, follow through with both hands. I don't know if she's right-handed or left-handed to be honest, so we got to figure that out. And you know, she is lifting off the ground. That's really good to see. Good extension, but you know, she's kind of stepping in with this left foot and pulls the right leg back. Let's get more balanced on our takeoff and landing. Would love for her, ideally, to be ready to receive this pass. Here comes the ball. She's kind of standing straight up, not really in a ready basketball position to catch and shoot. So, really, I would back up and really step into this pass, maybe left, right, and lift and elevate. And the reason you want to do that is, you know, a defender in a game situation, if you don't meet this pass, step in and meet this pass, like, this defender's going to run through and steal the ball. Again, there's the shot, good, good arc here. Let's hold our follow through. I mean, you can't even see the follow through here in this picture of the egocentric view. Would love to see a follow through with the extension of the, of the arm that we're shooting with. Let's be more balanced on our landing. Let's looks like the weight is a little bit forward again, above that left knee. Good lift here. Okay, here's a good look. It looks like maybe she is right-handed. I, it's hard to tell. I can see the right hand get under the ball, like, you know, like that looks really good here. Looks like the guide hand is just toking pressure here on the left. That's good. I would recommend getting that left elbow in so that forearm is parallel to the floor. So let's move that left elbow in. You could see in this picture here how that left elbow is out. Let's pull that left elbow in. Good extension. Going up on the balls of our feet. Much better here. You know, and when she lands, she lifted off the ground here a little bit, but this left foot goes really forward. Her weight's a little off balance here. The left goes back, the right pulls back. Let's get more balanced here on our landing. And again, check out the follow-through. Both arms are extended. I don't know. She's shooting with both hands. I don't see a designated shooting hand. So again, she would benefit from starting in close and just really working on some form shooting. Here the ball hits the back of the rim and pops out. Again, let's hold that follow-through. Come down, landing, let's bend our knees. You can see where she's kind of locked out her legs here. Again, that right leg turned out. Let's square up our entire body. Here the shooter does a really nice job of bending her knees and dropping her hips. Very, very good. I would work on having more of a staggered stance. When your feet are really close together, it's hard to get lift and push up. Plus it's a balance and stability issue. So ideally, let's spread those feet. One foot in front of the other. Here I'm still trying to see if she's a right or left-handed shooter. It looks like her left hand is behind the ball more. I don't really see the guide hand in this picture. But I do know she's shooting with two hands, as you can see here. Again, let's designate one shooting hand behind the ball and the guide hand, non-shooting hand on the side. Again, good knee bend, flexion here, dropping of the hips. Let's get those feet apart. Here's the lift. You know, let's take out one of those hands. You know, when you shoot with both hands, you could kind of see the balls kind of going side to side. It just can throw off the trajectory, you know, when the ball hits, it could throw it off. That's why we want to see really good backspin. Again, good extension of the legs and hips here. Again, she steps with hard with that left foot. I really ideally would love to see her jump straight up and come straight down in the same spot that she takes off and lands in the same spot. Again, I think that right hand is behind the ball or under the ball, and that this hand is really kind of not on the, not behind and not on the side. It's just in a really, um, position that's not ideal to be in successful. Let's spread the feet. Great knee bend, dropping of the hips here. Just really need to work on hand placement. Again, you know, just off balance here on the landing. You know, follow, see the weight of the body is forward over that left knee. Let's get everything centered here and under our both of our feet. Just a little off balance here on the follow through. Here, it looks like, it's really hard for me to see, but that this hand comes really far behind the ball, and I don't know if she's shooting with her left hand, or then the right hand is kind of under the ball. So just her hand placement, I think, in terms of executing and making more shots, we need to really look at the hand placement here on the basketball. Here looks good. Let's get the feet apart again. Love how she's got her eye on the target. Here again, continued bending of the knees, let's spread the feet. I love how she's, you know, looking at her, looking at her target by, you can see her, her chin is up and she's looking over the top of the ball, which is really good here.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Right here, this is more like it. Broke his wrist there on the follow through. The ball come off the pointy middle of the finger, so he's in good position here. Right here, the offhand, still looks like he used his left thumb here. You want to make sure that hand is open and flat. Leaving space in between both of the hands to make sure he's able to see the target. No distractions or having the ball cover his vision is pretty good. I'm right here shooting fading back, kicking one leg up for safety purposes. I highly not recommending you do that. Being able to jump off two feet and land on two feet is the safest and the most accurate and consistent way to shoot. He started shooting here. Ended up here. You want to make sure as you shoot, you land and don't fade backwards. That will take rhythm away from your shot to cause a lack of consistency. Right here, snake biting this follow through. You want to make sure you extend this one. Whereas the left hand is kind of seep up here. You want to make sure that offhand is open and allow the ball to roll off those fingertips. Right here, landing, he's landing on his heels and he's also fading to his right. You want to make sure when you land you're stationary or landing on the balls of your feet versus your heels.

They have used the outside of their left foot to juggle the ball. They've had their left knee bend inside to allow them to create a flat surface with the outside of their boot. The underside of the boot has contacted the ball underneath which allows the ball to go straight back up and allows the player to continue juggling. The player has contacted the ball too far around at the front. By contacting the ball there, the ball is now going right into his body. This makes it very challenging for them to make the next juggle because there's no room for their leg to move. They have to step back very quickly or stand still and hope that the ball can bounce off their foot on the floor. The player has juggled the ball using the top of their foot. They have contacted the ball low to the ground. By taking the contact at this point, it allows them to strike the ball with their left foot, place the left foot back down quickly and allow their right foot to come up for the next action. The player is continuing to put backspin on the ball upon contact with their foot. They've done this by pointing their toes and upon the contact, wrapping their toes up around the front of the ball. The player keeps their eye on the ball at all times during the juggling sequence. The player has contacted the ball with their thigh or quad. Their right leg stays bent, allowing them to be balanced. Bringing the left leg up and at almost 90 degrees to the ground. The contact at 90 degrees means that the ball will go straight up in the air and stay in the vicinity that the player wants it. The player is completing the juggle with their thigh or quad. Their right leg is bent and they are very low to the ground. This is because they didn't get their feet set quickly enough and in order to use their thigh and maintain the 90 degree contact to get the ball back up in the air, they needed to be lower to the floor to be able to do this. Players use their chest to cushion the ball and by leaning back upon contact, they have been able to take out the power in the ball, allowing it to drop at their feet so they can continue the juggling process. The player has the ball high in the air, their eyes are fixed on it, and they are now preparing to receive the ball. Given the flight path of the ball, the player is leaning back and away so they can present their chest or shoulder to the ball to carry on the juggling sequence. The player has attempted to juggle the ball with his quad or thigh. They've missed the contact point, the fleshy part of the thigh, which allows the ball to go straight back up, and have ended up contacting the ball with their knee on the side of the ball. This is causing the ball to go away from them and will not be easy for them to keep in the air. The player is juggling the ball with their right foot. They are taking the ball at its lowest point to the ground. This allows the player to bring their foot up to the ball and then after the contact is made, can put their foot back down quickly and regain balance. The player has contacted the ball too high at this moment. They've brought their foot higher off the floor. This is going to make it more challenging for them to put their right foot down and use their left foot for the next action. The player is putting backspin on the ball, again by pointing their toes forwards and wrapping underneath the ball, they can create the backspin. The backspin allows the ball to come back to their body versus going away from them and dropping the ball. The ball has gotten a little out of control on the player and they're having to reach with their right leg to make contact with the ball. The player's aim at this moment is to get the ball as high as they can to give themselves enough time to adjust under the flight of the ball to get the ball back under control. The ball is on the left side of the player's body. The player has used the outside of their left foot to keep the ball in the air. This is an advanced technique executed very well. The player keeps the surface of the outside of their foot as flat to the contact point on the ball as they can. This is allowing the ball to go straight back up in the air and allows them to continue the juggling sequence. The player has contacted the ball underneath and then rolled up the front of the ball causing the ball to have backspin. This helps the ball stay close to the player's body during the juggling process.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She needs to press her shoulders down so that her neckline is longer and that her shoulders do not look tense. She doesn't finish the rotation of her arms down and around in her right arm. We see her right arm is bent and it stops midway in front of her chest. The dancer's knee here is slightly bent. We see the line of her leg is distorted at her knee joint. She needs to straighten her legs completely when she's standing firmly. The dancer's hands are in a bit awkward of a position. She's tucking her fingers into her thumb, curling them in, and instead they should be pointing outward. Instead, her upper body is facing towards the corner of the room, towards the camera, as evidenced by where she's also looking.

She would benefit from bending a bit more deeply in this right knee as well as extending this left leg further out to the side. She does have a lot of nice clarity in her arms. However, overall, this is a moment where she really starts to disconnect from the rhythm, where prior to this she had been very consistently connected. As the dancer transitions into this movement which locomotes her forwards and backwards in the space and is kind of a basic salsa step She demonstrates her understanding of the movement technique here She's got a lot of nice clarity and movement dynamic happening in the arms both choreographically and rhythmically And also maintains a nice soft pelvis as well as bent knees and continues to maintain clarity in her footwork as well This is a real moment of shine for the dancer As the dancer begins through some basic salsa movements, she demonstrates that she has a solid understanding of the movement vocabulary as well as technique. She's able to incorporate her arms choreographically in a way that's clear and appropriate, maintains a nice soft bend in her knees as she moves through the movements, which is keeping her grounded and stable, and has a lot of clarity in her footwork as well as in the use of her pelvis. As the dancer moves through a couple of different basic salsa steps, as well as some more creative or freestyle moments, she really struggles to what appears to be remember the choreography. So this could be resolved with just some additional rehearsal so that she has a deeper understanding of the choreography, as well as how to transition from one phrase to the next. Here the dancer struggles to transition from this stationary step-touch movement into a box step which will locomote her through the space a bit more. She appears to be looking off-camera over her left shoulder here. Perhaps she's getting distracted by another person in the space or simply is just unable to recall the choreography to transition more effectively in this movement. Overall, some additional rehearsal to find this clarity in the transition would be beneficial. As the dancer transitions into this step that's starting to locomote her through the space a little bit more, she could use a bit of additional rehearsal through the transition. She's struggling to smooth out that kind of quick moment between the movement phrase prior into this movement phrase and overall would just benefit from some additional rehearsal to find clarity there. However, she's really maintaining a consistent incorporation of the arms as well as the feet and the movement in the pelvis, which is helping her to stay connected to the rhythm even through these transitions.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Again, his follow-through is really high. You know, we want that follow-through to be in this, in the ego view here. We should be able to see this arm laid out here. Better going up on the balls of the feet. I still love to see him jump and use more legs. Here's the shot. Again, this looks really nice. See that guide hand? It's kind of almost... It's not on top of the ball. It was on the side, but then he pulls it back toward him and up. We just need it to stay down and to stay in place. It doesn't really move. Good extension. Love to see him jump. I love his... He's square to the basket. This looks really nice. Here's again, the shooting arm is not so bad. It looks, actually looks pretty good here. Maybe elbow in a tad. I like the snapping of the wrist. Again, get this guide arm down. We don't want it coming across the body. Good extension. We'd love to see him get off the ground here. A lot of his shots are hitting the front of the rim. That tells me he needs more lower body, more legs, more power. Again, his follow-through does bend the knees a little bit, a lot better. But see, his follow-through is straight up. It needs to be more arced, like following this basketball to the rim. See his follow-through, it's way up high. Could throw off the spin of the ball as it makes its way to the basket. Here, he's got a follow through that's really high, because you can't even see his follow through. You should be able to see his follow through in this picture. His follow through is really high. He probably has way too much arc on the ball. And then he kind of locks it out, flat-footed. My suggestion is follow the, that your arm should be bent, or you know, following the ball to the basket. Drop, being real light on the hips and knees and feet. Go to Beadaholique.com for all of your beading supply needs! Here again, then he pauses. I mean, he's going to be defended. In a game, you don't have time to do all that. If it is a free throw, I like how his feet are set, one foot in front of the other. That right foot's in front because he's a right-hand shooter. He drops his hips a little. He takes a deep breath, I'm sure, looks at the target. Again, if this is a free throw, it looks really nice. You know, knees are bent, staggered stance. He's dropping his hips, eyeing his target. That ball's out in front. His vision takes his eyes over on top of the ball, across to the rim. But in a game, if this is a jump shooting drill, like a jump shot, you don't have time to do all this. You've got to catch and shoot before this defender guards you. Here's his shot. Pretty good. Maybe right elbow in a little bit. I love how it comes off the pads of these fingers. Again, let's drop that left elbow and get that hand should be more over here facing in. He goes up on the balls of his feet. We'd love to see him get off the ground and lift his body up. Here's the shot. Again, good extension of the elbow. Maybe just get that right elbow in a little bit. I love the follow-through, snapping of the wrist, fingers are down. This guide arm needs to come in. It's just really high and across the body. You know, we just want to keep that elbow bent. It really doesn't do anything. All its work is helping get the ball up to where you want to release it. Good extension of the hips. Free throw would be great going up on the balls of the feet, but overall I think he really needs to use a lot more of his legs. Here the shooter is shooting a 15-foot jump shot. It looks like he's shooting a free throw, so, because he's not jumping, he took two dribbles. Yeah, I don't know if it's a, if it is a free throw, that's okay. You don't need to jump. You don't need, you could take one or two dribbles because you have 10 seconds to shoot the basketball. But in the jump shooting drill, we need to jump, and I would love to see him use his legs more to lift this ball to the basket. You know, the ball coming off his shooting arm and hand, not too bad. I get this right elbow in a tad. I love this, how it comes off these pads of the fingers. The left arm maybe coming across the body a little bit too much. You see that hand. We'd love that elbow to be bent, that forearm parallel, that palm of that left non-shooting hand facing the other arm. I can't tell if he's using it in his shot, but it does come across his body here. Again, here's a shooting hand behind the ball that looks good. I just think this guide arm, we need some work with the guide arm. We need to drop this elbow, but the hand comes off. It just comes off. He pulls it back, it looks like, instead of just letting the hand be, and the ball just kind of shoots through that hand. But I love the 90 degree, good body control. Again, I love to see him step into a pass one time and jump. Not bad snapping of the wrist, maybe point those fingers, maybe the right elbow comes in a tad. Again, let's get this left shooting, non-shooting arm down. Good extension here. Goes up on the balls of his feet. Again, if this is a free throw, this technique looks good. But if it's a game like, you've got to get off the ground and shoot over this defender. Again, he begins his shot. He does have his left hand here on the side, maybe a little looser grip here. You don't want your left non-shooting guide hand to grip the basketball. Just real light, soft pressure. But I like that. I like bending the knees, dropping the hips. He's got that ball sitting on that right hand, that elbow's 90 degree, and he's looking over the rim, over the ball at the rim. Again, here's the shot on a free throw, going up on the balls of the feet is nice, but again, if it's a jump shooting drill, we need to use more legs and get more power and lift, jump, but not bad here. Again, that left hand comes across. We need to keep it down in here. Your guide arm really is not in the shot. It just stays there, the elbow bent, balancing the ball in this hand. Again, you know, if this is a free throw, this is fine, but if it's a jump shooting drill, it needs to be more like game-like, catch and shoot. You don't have time to dribble it and look down at it.

This is really useful because the more the climber understands the intention and sequence of the climb before they pull off the ground, the more efficient they'll be able to be on the wall and more likely they'll be successful. Yeah, we see the climber attempt to recover this by coming back to the start hold, but that downward motion takes a lot of momentum and it just pulls them off the wall. So we see a climber established with both feet on the wall. Because they want to be able to put more pressure into the left foot, they almost immediately take the right foot off and end up moving it into a slightly flagged position. This is helpful but not super necessary. It's only a matter of a couple of inches and they're moving their foot, so if they kept it pressed and keep pressure on it in the other foot position, they would be fine there as well. So something a little strange as we see the climber just kind of directly pointing with one finger Generally what we would want to see here is the climber pantomiming the hold Position with their hand and how they expect to hold it And it gives them a better idea of what to do with each hold and it helps them keep To the intended left right left sequence finish then how each hand is supposed to be positioned on each hold", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And the climber attempts to pull into this tufa hold here and gets around it but just is not able to actually utilize the usable surface of the hold. That's probably because they're feeling uncomfortable on this left hand pinch. I don't know this climber, maybe they're not, maybe pinches are not part of their repertoire, but nevertheless they get the reach but not quite the usable surface here and then they fall off the boulder.

That enables the piano player to have more control. As she was playing this last thing, she sort of skipped over the note right there, and so there wasn't a very clear attack to each of those notes, so she didn't push down hard enough into the keys to get a clearer sound. So she could have gotten a more clear sound by pushing in a little bit more, giving a little bit more weight, and starting each note with a more precise attack or a precise start to the note. Now what she just did is that she played both hands together. So she demonstrated that the right hand has a different fingering than the left hand. And so she played it very slowly to make sure that she did it accurately. And she did it accurately with the right fingerings, but the notes could have been more even and more connected. Right here she's demonstrating playing the scale with her left hand and normally your left hand is supposed to go one two three four five and then your third finger your middle finger but for some reason she used her ring finger right here for this note and that is not the correct fingering for the scale. She still played the correct note but the fingering was the incorrect finger. She kept a pretty curved hand shape with her left hand as she went up and down the fingerboard right or the keyboard right here and she did it with a pretty smooth and connected sound thanks to her curved hand shape and she was able to find the different positions on the keyboard very accurately so that sounded pretty clear. As she is demonstrating playing octaves with her right hand, her thumb is right here and then her pinky is supposed to be pressing down this note, but she accidentally pressed down two notes at a time. As you can see, her right pinky is pressing down that note and then it's pressing down this note as well. So that is a little bit of her hand just reaching a little bit too far. So that precision could be a little bit better with her hand shape. As she's going down the scale with both hands, she accidentally played the incorrect fingering with her right hand. Right here, her pointer finger is playing that C, but she should have her thumb there if she's playing it with the correct fingering. She just played a C major scale with her right hand using all of these white keys, and she did it with the correct fingering, meaning she used the right fingers for each note. So for the C major scale on the right hand, she uses her first, second, third finger, and then her hand moves over, and then she plays her first, second, third, fourth, and fifth fingers, and she did that with the accurate fingering. She demonstrated that she could practice the skill of putting both hands together with the correct fingerings by playing it slower, which is a good strategy for practicing. Now the second time that she played it, she used her middle finger to play that note, that finger to play that note, and that finger to play that note, and that is the correct fingering, and so she corrected herself, and so that is what fingers that are traditionally used for that scale with that hand. As for the left hand, she used the correct fingering, but when she shifted over to play from G to the A, she accidentally overshot and she accidentally played the B and kind of skipped a note as her hand moved positions. So that was something that she played inaccurately because her hand wasn't in the right spot.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

However, this is difficult for her because her right foot being in place keeps her right side close to the wall so it makes it a lot more lengthy to send the left hand up for the reach. Reason why she is not able to wrap her fingers above the edge of the hold. Now the left leg is not positioned into any foot chips and instead is extended. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. We can see the climber bringing her right knee in and doing a twist of her body to send her center of gravity over to the right as she was planning to release the right hand to go up to the next hold. The climber making hand gestures is so that she's able to visualize the holds on the route as performing hand placements and how the body will need to move when at that section of the wall. The climber keeping her right side being the right hand and the right foot being in place towards the wall was applying a lot of force to send the left hand out for the reach. This is because the climber is forcing her center of gravity over to the opposite direction making it impossible to make the holder reach and she has done this dynamically where she had engaged onto the right foot bringing her center of gravity close to the wall on the opposite direction where her left hand was going to and has engaged onto forcefully twisting her left shoulder so that she was able to bring her hand up for the reach. This actually can apply a lot of force onto the right shoulder making it tired so the climber has come off the wall and sit on the mat and didn't climb. The climber chooses to retract from almost performing the move, sending the right hand up while bringing the hip over to the right side and retracts the move to perform a foot switch. It's important that the climber always glances down when performing a new foot placement or doing a foot switch. Where she has brought the right toe to come close to where her left foot is And she's performing a common technique of foot switching where she jumps off the left toe out of place to bring the right toe to jump where the left toe was, being placed above the foothold. This is a method or technique of foot switching that is the most commonly used and it works but at times it's really hard to make the placement accurate, especially in a small foothold. At the same time, this takes a fair bit of energy when being performed. The climber is starting at a one-hold start where she places both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching. And now we can see how she is ascending to the lip of the hold. With a slight indent into the hold, the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold. And to apply extra pressure, the climber secures the grip by placing the thumbs at the bottom of it to squeeze the hold. After she has secured the grip, we can see how the climber was able to transfer over the weight, keeping the arms extended and pulling onto the hold. As she brings her feet onto a rise, where she places the left foot slightly lower on the wall and brings the right foot over a distance to be pushed away. Now the climber, in pushing down the feet, she is able to raise the hips and is glancing over at the next hold at reach.

So in this position he is hanging on with the right hand here as well as utilizing a left foot in this position. It's a little bit hard to say exactly what's going on with his right foot because I can't clearly see it in this image, but what we can focus on is that the climber is doing his best to stand up with that left foot. The only thing I wish to see is a little bit more transitioning of his body weight over onto that left side because what I ended up seeing in this image right here is that as the climber reached up to that left hand we can kind of see that his head almost kind of shot back showing that there was a lot of body weight kind of being shifted backwards. So this does completely rely on the climber being able to hang on to that left hand in order to complete this movement. So that kind of shows to me that the climber is relying a little bit on his right arm and what it's doing. So that kind of shows to me that he is pulling quite a bit with it, but as he moved up with his left hand there was a lot of body weight for him to control just solely on his right arm because he's not entirely incorporating his lower body into this movement. So again he's continuing to use his upper body, but because he's been doing that this could lead to him being extremely tired and making it much harder to complete this movement which is why his head kind of shot back showing his fatigue through this continuing of the powerful movement. So here we can see the climber is able to reach over to the first hold with his left hand in this position. So what the climber was able to do is hang on with his right hand on the starting handhold here. And he was able to utilize a left foot on this starting foothold here. So because the climber is using opposite points of contact, he is able to kind of get a good balance of his posture, which is going to be centered between those two points. So what the climber is able to do is he's able to transition a lot of his body weight over that left foot to try and guide his body in the direction that he needs to. But what we see going on is the climber is focusing a lot on how much he's pulling with that right arm in order to complete this movement. So this is using up quite a bit of energy on his upper body. And I would encourage the climber to kind of straighten out his arm, so then that way he can focus a lot more on his legs doing the majority of the work, as opposed to his arms. And so here we can see from that position the clamber tried to bump his left hand up into this next handhold position And the way he did that was He kept his body in the same exact position as the previous move and being that the previous move was already pretty difficult on the clamber to begin with Demonstrating that he was using a lot of power on his right arm Doing this move in this fashion Probably is not the most recommended for the clamber Also, because it did lead to his fall So what I would recommend for the climbers in the previous position I would encourage him to try and figure out a new foot position Try and adjust his body weight to where it needs to be So then that way he has a better opportunity of reaching up to this pink hold a little bit better Because by allowing yourself as a climber to just kind of extend yourself and reach up to the next better handhold Could make it possible for you to continue climbing But typically makes you lead into a fall or puts you in a really bad position Even more difficult to continue moving So I would always encourage climbers to find a better foot position kind of in a higher position So then that way you set yourself up for the next move and can continue climbing afterwards And so here we can see the clamber was able to move his right hand up into this next handhold So in this position he is hanging on with the left hand here as well as utilizing a right foot in this position Um, so because he's using opposite points of contact that are lined up with each other This does allow the clamber to get into a move called a back step in where he's able to rotate the right side of his Body closer to the wall so he's able to reach over with this right hand a little bit easier I'm in the main purpose of the back step is to utilize his legs much more in throughout the movement And so we can see that the clamber is sitting down on his right leg Making sure that his right knee is pointed over to the left and this helps to kind of get that rotation that he is Trying to get with the right side of getting closer to the wall And then on top of that you also need to make sure you utilize a really good a flagging foot So this clamber's flag foot is pretty good But straight intentional kind of being placed up against the wall so as this helps to create tension throughout the entire body And but again, we can see that the clamber is focusing a lot on his pulling power with his left arm in this instance Um, so again, he's using quite a bit of energy And so I would recommend that he strains out his arm a little bit more so he can allow his legs to do the majority of the work", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I like this move because the climber has to get up and over this tufa rail so it makes the move pretty spicy is what we would call it. You kind of have to slam into this right hand because you're falling away so you have to over accentuate a little bit and it's a nice move. A lot of people don't like this instance on spray walls. That's why you don't see a ton of big holds on a traditional spray wall but I do like this aspect of it. Here we have the climber matched on this down pulling. It's not quite a jug, but it is in-cut, kind of a rounded in-cut rail hold. And then right foot's pasted on this hold, foothold just above the kicker. The climber then switches feet from right to left in order to flag the right foot really far out, get all their weight underneath this right hand, and that's what allows the climber to come in and match just above the hold that they're on. I say match, it's not technically a match, but when you have two holds really close like this, you sometimes describe it as a match. Anyway, the climber then switches their feet again to the right foot, and here they are pulling again really hard in this direction with this foot, dropping this knee in, and anticipating a right move out. Their laser pointer was hovering over this hold. And after the start, the climber just punches up into this right hand. Pretty small move, kind of a setup move for this next sequence.

For this step step, I would like to see the dancer really think about accentuating from staccato to this melting action and really circulating these hips that I've talked about in a couple of other videos. Here's a moment where they could definitely be more grounded and they'll be able to articulate those hips even further. The dancer turns and they do a good job of spotting, but they're not always in control of their turns. And it kind of sways a little bit.

I would like to see the dancer work on the balls of their feet so they're not slipping and sliding, but they're really in control of their step pivot.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

However, they still maintain a lot of stiffness in their arms, their upper body, and their pelvis, which is keeping them from fully embodying the rhythm. As the dancer begins with a basic salsa step, they demonstrate that they have an understanding of the movement vocabulary, as well as the movement technique here. They're a little stiff in their shoulders and their arms and their upper body in general. However, they've got some nice movement in their pelvis, as well as their feet, and they're able to stay fairly connected to the music. As a dancer performs a basic salsa step moving forwards and backwards in the space, they're able to stay closely connected to the rhythm of the music, particularly through their footwork. However, they still are quite stiff through their shoulders, their torso, their pelvis, and their legs and body overall. They've got a lot of movement in their arms, so their arms are remaining quite stiff and lacking a lot of fluidity, which shows that they're not able to fully embody the rhythm. As a dancer begins to reach their foot out to the side bringing it back in and then alternating sides, they gain a greater range of motion in their shoulders and their arms though their arms are still quite stiff and not necessarily executing specific choreography aside from this one kind of repeatable step or movement. However, they've lost all the range of motion in their pelvis making their overall movement appear quite stiff. They would benefit from bending their knees more, dropping their pelvis back, and being more grounded in their movement. Thank you for watching!", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

His feet are still in the same position which are kind of spread out from his left side and over to his right side. So this is just showing a good demonstration that he's able to distribute his body weight between those two feet. But what we're noticing that as soon as he grabs onto that left hand hold, we can see that it's kind of in a U-shape hold and it's flat and rounded on top of it. So this is what we call a sloper and where typically a climber wants to increase the amount of friction that they're placing on that hold and this gives them the best chance of hanging on to that hand hold. But as a climber pulls up into a sloper, it typically actually makes it worse. So we can see with this climber he's naturally pulling in with that left hand just because he wants to try and reinforce how much he's hanging on to that hold. But this does naturally make it a little bit harder for him to be able to complete. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing his right hand into the next handhold here. So in this position he is having to pull in with this undercling pocket hold that he's holding on to. And that's kind of typical with an undercling hold, just because you are having to pull up into it to make the best use of it. And so for this climber, it does seem like he's pretty comfortable getting himself in a somewhat extended position, just probably because he is a pretty tall climber. But for shorter climbers, I would definitely say that by placing his right foot in this low position here, might be a little bit too low. So I would always encourage climbers to find a higher right foot that would help promote them in their movement. Because not only do you want to think about the movement that they're completing, but you also want to think about the following moves. So if a shorter climber attempted to do this move with the same right foot that this climber is using, that kind of naturally places them in a very extended position and could make it hard for them to continue to move from any further movement. So that's why I would always encourage climbers to find a higher foot, so then that way they can continue keeping control of their body. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing his right hand over into the next handhold here. So he is demonstrating a proper lock off with his left arm. So lock off is when your elbow is kind of in a 90 degree angle or closer to the wall. So here we see that the climber is doing a really good demonstration of that. And the trick with that is helping to transfer his body weight over his right foot so that he can continue to reinforce the direction that he wants to go to. So this is a really good demonstration to see from the climber. So here I believe is where the climber has the best opportunity to be able to finish the boulder. So he does have a high right heel hook and he's still hanging on with that left arm. So we can see that his left arm is still slightly extended, or slightly flexed rather, and I would actually encourage the climber to make sure that he actually extends his arm as much as possible. So then that way he's no longer having to pull on that left hand hold and it actually helps to encourage to hang on to the hold in the best way possible by keeping his arm in an extended position. So I would definitely encourage the climber to also flag his left foot directly underneath him and this would kind of help him to encourage his heel hook and the use of it because by using that heel hook a little bit more properly he should be able to kind of adjust his body weight between his left hand and that right heel which will then allow him the opportunity of bringing his right hand over into that final hand hold. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring in his right hand into the next handhold here. So in this position the climber was able to still keep his high right foot, but he also was able to place a low left foot as well. So by getting himself in this position here, this does allow him to kind of distribute his bodyweight evenly between those two feet he's utilizing. And then he's also doing a good job of making sure there's arms in a straight position so that he's having to relax his arms and not having to pull and engage them, which uses up a lot of energy quickly. And so here we can see the Clamor was able to make the next small move of bringing his left hand over into the screen hold here. So in this position he is hanging on with the right hand here and he was able to get a high right foot as well. So because he's using two points of contact that are on the same side of each other, this does kind of naturally place him in an imbalanced position. Just because his body kind of runs to rotate around those two points. So what the Clamor is doing is with his left foot he is flagging it down into the right. And so this helps to encourage placing a lot of his body weight on that high right foot. And then the trick with doing all this is making sure that his body weight is directly underneath his right arm. So then that way he's not having to pull or engage it and this also helps to reduce the natural rotation that his body is experiencing right here. But what we can see is that as the Clamor is reaching in with the left hand, he's kind of pulling in a little bit with that right arm. But because the move is pretty small, he's not having to pull on it too much. So here we can see the clamber was able to make the first move of bringing his left hand over to the first holder right over here. And in this position we can see that the clamber was having to pull in with both of his arms and that could be just because his left foot is in a starting position that's very high. So what that does is it naturally kind of forces his hip to sit out and away from the wall and so because he's so close to the ground he doesn't really want to touch the ground because of it in his attempt so that's kind of forcing him to have to engage his arms. That could be the main reason why he's having to pull with them to be able to complete this first move here. And so here we can see the climber was able to move his left hand up into the next handhold here So in this position he is hanging on with the right hand here as well as using a left foot on the wall right here So because he's using opposite points of contact with the wall and they're a little spread out from each other This does allow him to get really good control of his movements so that he's able to transfer his body We comfortably over his left foot But what we see happening is the climber is allowing his left knee to kind of be pointed towards the wall And what this does is it pulls the rest of his body away from the wall and kind of naturally forces him to have to Engage with his right arm a little bit Um, so it's kind of hard to say if he's doing that exactly but I would kind of argue that he is being forced to Pull in with his right arm, but it could be fairly comfortable for this climber to do that And then here we can see the clamor was able to bring his left hand up into the next held here. So this seems to be like an undercling pocket hold. A pocket is typically where you can only put like one, two, or three fingers inside of a hold. And it can be a little bit of a dangerous hold to hang on to just because there's so much pressure being applied to the tendons and ligaments inside your fingers. So if a foot slips while hanging onto a pocket, it could lead to injuries. But here in this case, we can see that the clamor is doing a really good job of making sure that he's allowing his body weight to hang back away from those holds with a straight arm position. And this helps to encourage his arms to be in a more relaxed state while his legs are in a bent position. And this kind of reinforces that a lot of his body weight is being placed on his legs. And that's kind of always an important thing to have. And so here we can see the climber was able to come over for matching his hold. And so one of the important things that in this position the climber was able to demonstrate was that he was able to demonstrate that he can transfer his body weight over to the left. And the main trick to that is making sure that majority of his body weight is placed underneath his left arm. And that's always an important thing to do is making sure that you transition your body weight appropriately before committing to a hand move. So that way you get really good control of what's going on with your body weight and then your hands aren't having to try and compensate with any extra swinging that could happen.

This should be avoided. What this is actually doing is creating an overcooked and tough end product. The egg has once again been flipped over and this time you can see evidence of browning of the egg. Again, a lower heat and no flipping will help to minimize or eliminate any browning. Here the egg mixture is added to the heated saut\u00e9 pan and you can hear sizzling when the egg mixture hits the oil. This is an indication that the heat is too high. So to avoid this sizzling, start with a low flame rather than a high flame for cooking the egg. Here a saute pan is selected for cooking the omelet. This is a good choice of pan. It is the proper shape. However, this pan is a little too large in diameter for the egg that is going to be cooked. A better choice is a six to eight inch diameter or 15 to 20 centimeter diameter saute pan. Also, the flame is being lit under the pan and it's a relatively large flame. I would recommend using a low flame because what we want to do is prevent the egg from any browning. Here the omelet is folded in half. This is what you want to do when preparing a classic French omelet. Either fold in half or roll. However, this omelet has been flipped several times prior to folding in half. You can see that it is quite overcooked due to the browning on the exterior of the omelet. Here the omelet has been flipped over and the cooked side up now and the less than cooked side on the underside. When making a classic omelet one would not want to flip the egg over. The preparer is using a good technique here where he is tilting the pan to allow some of the uncooked egg mixture to go over to the edges of the pan and literally underneath the omelette that is cooking. Here, raw onion and raw chili has been chopped and is being placed in the bowl where the egg will also be placed. When making a classic omelet, your filling, in this case the onions and the chili, should be sauteed prior to adding them to the omelet. This can be done using the same pan that the omelet will be cooked in, just removing the cooked veg from the pan prior to cooking the eggs. It also appears that the egg mixture is floating on top of the oil. This would indicate that there was too much oil used in the pan and will result in a very oily end product. Oil is being added to the pan. While this is an acceptable fat, a classic omelet is traditionally made with clarified butter. The butter will provide a rich richness to the taste of the finished product. Here, one egg has been added to the bowl with the raw onions and chili, and a fork is being used to mix the egg and the vegetable. Now, two things here. The eggs, you should be using two to three eggs to make a proper omelet. In this case, only one was being used. And two, a fork is actually a really good selection for a tool to mix the eggs. It will allow the eggs to become a homogeneous mixture if mixed for a long enough time. An alternative to the fork would be a whisk. What you want to prevent is any white streaks of the egg in your end omelet.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

So that's really good. In this position at the same time as she's extending her arms upward, she's pressing her shoulders downward so that her neckline is long and also bending her left leg here so that her right leg when she's raising it with her knee looks even more severe because she's bringing that upward while pressing her left leg downward. The dancer does a good job here of lifting her knee high up into the air, her right leg, making her range of motion large. She's also standing on her tippy toes on her releve, which is a term in dance with her heels lifted off the ground So it's making her taller and her verticality pulled completely upward The dancer is turning flat-footed with her entire foot on the floor, every part of it, her toe, the ball of her foot, her center part of her foot, and the heel.

We want our momentum to go slightly towards the basket or jump straight up and down. But even when we jump straight up and down, we're going to come slightly forward. So on the release of our shot, we have to make sure that our momentum and our body is going slightly forward towards the basket rather than back and away from the basket. If our momentum is consistently going backwards and away from the basket, that increases the difficulty of making the shot, which lessens our shooting percentage. We're going to end up not being able to make shots as consistently as we want to. The shooter steps into his shot with his left foot first on the catch and as he catches the ball he's going to step with his right foot, placing his right foot into position in order to shoot the ball. This is called stepping into your shot and stepping into your shot allows you to create a momentum and gather rhythm for your shot. On the release of the ball you can see his right shooting hand as he releases the ball. He does a good job of following through. As from this view we can see the back of his hand. So that lets us know that the ball is... he snapped his wrist and allowed the ball to roll off of his fingertips to create backspin on the ball. We take a look at the placement of his left guide hand. You can see that his wrist is turned and is facing slightly downward at this angle here. On the release of the ball we want that palm open and facing directly to the right as we release the ball. Like our wrist should not be turned to where our... if we drew a line from the midpoint of our palm that is facing at this angle or this angle or even the palm is pointed outward and it's going in say this direction towards the basket. We don't want our palm facing that way. We just want our palm, our left palm on the release of the ball to be facing directly to the right as we release the ball. The fingers can be facing the basket or straight up and down. That's fine but the palm itself needs to be directly to the right on the release of the ball. Doing so will allow the ball to leave the right shooting hand and having that palm open and facing the direction of the right ensures that the left guide hand is not interfering with the release and the follow through of the ball from the right hand. We take a look at the positioning of the shooter's feet. We see that his right foot is slightly in front of his left foot. This allows for his elbow to be aligned with the front of the rim so long as the placement of his hand his right hand is in the correct position on the ball. If we take a look at the shooter's right index finger it's on it's in the middle portion of the basketball so it's in the correct position. However, his elbow is still pointing outward and it's due to him having his arm at the angle like this, at this angle on the ball. So, from the placement of his feet and the placement of his hands, it allows for him to bring his elbow in closer to his body, pointing the ball, pointing his elbow at the front of the rim. So he has the ability to move his elbow in and for it to be comfortable and more natural. But since he's not doing it, it's just that he's not focusing on getting that elbow in. So he has to, because he has all the hand placement is correct and the position of his foot is correct so it will allow for his elbow to be more straight. If, it's hard to tell from like this camera angle but if he's not comfortable in bringing that elbow in for the, underneath the ball to shoot that is a sign that the ball is, he is shooting the ball too far to the left of his body and he needs to bring the ball over more to the right. Is, from this angle right here it looks like the ball is in the, in his middle section so I don't think that's an issue but that's something that you will see with people who bring the ball up and they shoot. If that's a right-handed shooter, if there's a draw a line straight down the middle of their body they're beginning the release of their ball on the left side of their body instead of in the middle or more towards the right side of their body. So when the release is on the left side of their body their elbow is going to be pointed outward even if the footwork and the hand placement is correct. In those situations they have to bring the ball over more towards the right towards the middle midline of their body or slightly to the right of that midline of their body. But I don't think that's the issue for him. I can't tell if that's the problem from this view of the camera. So at this, with the information I see here it's just that he just has to make a conscious effort of bringing that elbow in more in this direction so it's more properly aligned with the front of the rim.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I encourage this dancer to take bigger steps. They can do that by dropping their pelvis. I think this dancer could really think about moving between staccato and legato movements and really thinking about dynamic quality, one to be soft and have this beautiful flow that they normally do versus one to really pick up the energy and hit it. I encourage the dancer to really articulate over articulate their rib cage so it creates more fluidity and flow throughout the movement.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He wouldn't necessarily have needed to flip it again either. Flipping it once on, cooking it once on each side is plenty because it is fairly thin and it just doesn't need that much. And now he's flipped this omelet. Once he flipped it, it became a masala omelet or another egg dish, but no longer is it a French omelet, because that would never have been flipped. He's cutting his green chili now. Small cross cuts all the way down, identical. That will instantly make it a dice. And he's placed the plate on the burner that's not being used beside the one where he's got his skillet and omelet. He's adding a little salt to the pepper and onion. It can also add air into the mixture, which makes the eggs fluffy. And now he's created sort of a hybrid between the French and the masala because it's folded. That's very French because it's cooked on two sides. That's very masala. So either way. But he does have a nice looking omelet right now. He's taking a bowl from a shelf. And now he's turned those cuts 45 degrees. He's just cut a small piece off the side of the onion And now he's retrieved his cutting board. Now he actually uses the pan to help him spread the oil because the pan is heating up, the oil is going to thin out as it heats, and he's using the pan and rotating it in different directions to make that oil move in the areas he wants it to occupy. and he's making the exact same cut again only this time because the pieces were cut before, those will create a dice. He's making quick cuts to make half moon shapes, all going in the same direction, while firmly holding with his left hand his onion. And again, he's pressing on it, which again, I would not do. Now he has a skillet. It looks to be 10 or 12 inches. Its dark surface makes me think it's nonstick. It could be thin steel, but either way, he's putting it on the heat. As you can see, it's still circular, it's just more rustic on the edges. And here he's folded his omelet. Now it uses that fork again to stir this mixture together or whisk effectively is the motion. It's a rapid circular motion. It helps break the egg yolk and the egg white and then combine all the things so that they're evenly distributed in the omelet. And he's doing some pressing here with his spatula, which is not something I would ever recommend. It definitely deflates those air bubbles that you've gotten whisked in when you are initially trying to get the mixture all well combined, and it just sort of makes the egg mixture more dense. It doesn't need you to press on it to make it cook faster because it's getting contact with the heat. You can hear that and see it. And it's not a very thick formed item, so it doesn't take very long to cook all the way through. And now he's used the knife to tap vigorously on the outside of the egg, which breaks the shell and makes it easy to open. And he pours that egg mixture right in the pan. You can tell it sizzles immediately, which means his pan was heated up. He's cut a little stem end off of his onion and he's taking that off the cutting board. You don't want that to be included in your dish. and he's got an egg out of a carton. And he tilts the pan a little bit now to try to get the more raw egg mixture, which you can see is this darker egg from that top area to move into unoccupied parts of the pan so it can cook. Now here his pan is a larger diameter than the volume of his egg mixture, which means the sides of the pan won't be able to help him make a good shape on that. A French omelette would be a perfect round, so that's not going to happen here. And now he's got a plate. He has a small red onion he's taken out of a bag and put on the countertop. and he's using his knife to scrape the cut pepper and onion into the bowl. It's a good idea when you're cooking with vegetables and cutting them that you cut them to the same size if they're cooking for the exact same amount of time. Typically that's just the uniformity helps things cook more evenly and come out cooked at the same time. He's adding oil to the pan now. and now he's removing the papery skin. He's gotten a fork and he's using it to stir his salt, pepper, and onion. And here you can see he's actually holding the omelet against the side with his spatula. And as you see that, this mixture here is sliding into an unoccupied part of the pan, which is here. That's not a very standard thing to do with an omelet because you could probably more easily scrape into the unoccupied parts of the pan more than this sliding action. He's chosen a small utility knife similar to a paring knife. It has a flat blade not curved like a paring knife would. It's very typical for that to be used for vegetable cutting. I'm not exactly sure what he's doing right here. He's scraping the spatula along the base of the pan. There's nothing in the pan that I can tell. So I'm not sure if he's testing to see if this is the utensil he wants to use. I just don't really know. Or if he's seeing if there's something on the pan he was trying to get out. He's grabbed a singular small green chili pepper from the refrigerator. Because an omelet's very delicate, you just don't want to put that much pressure on any one part of it, as he's doing, again, moving that spatula to press against the sides and hold it so he can transfer some of the raw egg mixture off of the top of the omelet.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

Because the combination of those holds being so small, as you can see on the left side, he's just not in a position to get himself there. If he was on a jug, maybe he could, or these holds were quite good for him. They look to be near his limit, so already starting halfway there, he just doesn't have the rest of the half to get where he needs to go.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

While the wrist is straight, the fingers are actually coming up out of the hand, up from the hand where they should be hanging down from the hand. And part of this is we can tell that the pianist's nails are too long. We can really see these nails are too long. When the nails are long, it forces us to play more on the pad of the finger instead of the fingertips. The best thing to do would be to cut the nails short so that we can properly use our fingertips because if we're using our fingertips, a better hand shape will follow. In this descending line being played in the left hand here, we're hearing that some notes are speaking and some notes aren't, so it's very inconsistent. We need to hear every note at a bare minimum just being audible, but ideally even. A lot of this is due to poor hand shape. So we can see this finger, two of the three knuckles on this finger collapsed, and that's just going to make it very immobile, and so then you're losing the control that's needed to be able to play this consistently and audibly. We're hearing a very harsh articulation, and while these notes need to be loud, they don't need to be this aggressive. And so using less of the slapping motion from the wrist right here, and more of a downward heavy motion with the whole arm, is going to get the same volume, but a rounder and nicer to hear articulation. That's more appropriate for this music. We're hearing in the left hand that this alternating chord pattern of one note triad, one note triad is too short and part of the reason is we can see in this last couple seconds of playing that the pianist is using their whole wrist to rotate to play these. That is alright to involve the wrist some but we would want to use more finger motion than wrist here so that we can stay on the note longer because when you have to rotate your wrist to get to the lower note to play the lower note it means you have to have your fingers leave the keyboard especially if you're keeping just a chord shape in your hand and you're rotating it so that's why it's too short we just need to be a little bit more initiated from the fingers and a little bit longer. The pianist needs to make sure that these notes that were just played with the fifth finger are a little bit longer. They are leaving the note too soon and we're losing the melodic line. The pianist has now completely lost the rhythm. They're playing this a little bit faster than they're able to without losing rhythm. So just some slow practice on this and performing it at a slightly slower tempo would help. We're seeing a lot of excess motion on this descending line. This is visible by this raised fifth finger and this flattened fourth finger and the angle that the arm is now to the keys. Ideally, we just want to have a higher wrist so the fingers hang down. We want to lead with the hand as we're going down so that we can keep it a little bit more in line with the keys instead of leading with the fingers and just letting the wrist bend and move up and down to follow. And those alternating octaves being played with the right hand, we need to hear a longer note length, so don't come off of the key as soon, and also we need to hear more of the lower octave. We've completely lost rhythm and note accuracy here. The pianist needs to play this at a slower speed so that we can at least have consistent pulse and correct rhythm. As the pianist is playing this descending line, we see a lot of motion this way, a lot of up and down motion of the wrist. Ideally, we would just want the wrist to be a little bit higher with the fingers hanging down from it. It's just going to help with control of the volume of each note because that extra motion in the wrist can then be transferred into the keys and so we lose some consistency. Right here we can see way too much rotation in the arm. We can see that the side of the hand is almost completely facing up now. The arm is rotated over to the left way too much. Part of this is poor fingering choice. So a fingering choice where we're not going from five to one in the left hand is always preferable, but also curving the fingers more so that there's enough space under the hand to get the thumb underneath for this crossover is gonna help eliminate the need to have this much of a rotation. But with this much rotation, it becomes really difficult to control the length and articulation of the notes. We've completely lost the tempo here in the pulse, so it just needs to be played at a slower tempo. We need a bit of a lighter touch here in the left hand. This articulation's a little too intense for this accompanimental figure. And we also need to hear all three of these notes in this chord being played right here to be more in sync. And the way to do that is just to keep fingers one, two, and five a little firmer and use action from the arm and the wrist to press down the note. That's gonna help with consistency as well as balance. We notice that the right hand is very collapsed. You can see that it's actually nearly touching the keys right here with that top of the palm there and that the fifth finger is barely hanging onto the key. And this is leading to the inaccuracy that we're hearing right here and also the very kind of splat-like tone of these octaves. So having that wrist higher and having the fingers hang down from the hand is going to allow for much more control and accuracy so that these octaves and this last bit that you just played where it's a melody in octaves can be clearer and more accurate. We need a little bit less of the left hand here and a little bit longer note lengths on the right hand just to balance this out.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

We can see how the climber here sent the leg that was extended on the flag to be now the toe placed on top of the right toe instead of the hold. This will help the climber to stay in position to not lose the right foot and give extra pressure to the foot placement as well as the climber needing a moment of rest while he figures the next movement. Because his main area of support, the right foot and the right hand, are not as close being placed, the climber curves his core to go up in order to maximize the support of his right side. And the climber has extended the left toe to tap against the wall to add extra support as the climber brought his shoulder down to make a harder extension and support of the right hand that's on place. When the climber is ready, then when he's ready to extend the left arm for him going to the reach the climber, then we'll push down on the toe that is extended so he can have a boost when going up for the next hold. It's good that the climber glances down at the feet as foot placement needs to be accurate and important as the climber is going for the next hold at reach. So the climber places the left toe box area on the outer side of the hueco hold. This one, once he creates pressure, he will then be able to release the right foot that's inside of the hueco pushing on the lip. Here the climber sends a right hand from the hueco to come and match the top hold placing it one over the other as the climber finds a groove above the left hand. The climber brings the foot inwards to keep his center of gravity low and so the climber doesn't extend the leg so it helps the climber to keep stability when making the transition. Here the climber is getting positioned for dynamic reach. Since the left hand will have to make it to a hold at reach, the climber gets himself lowered, sends the right foot into a high position and now his maintenance areas support are on the right side. This the climber will engage by pushing down on the left foot that's on a foot placement and once a climber gains height and direction then the left leg will be extended into a flag where he's center of gravity then and mid reach the climber will be able to transfer the weight to the high foot being in place. The first move out of the start we can see how the climber shifts the weight to go over the right foot being in place and the climber's left leg has gone extended to the right being underneath the leg. This is called back flagging which the climber is using for stability and also to transfer over the weight to the highest foot and to bring his center of gravity close to the areas of support. As the climber released the left hand to go up for the next placement. It was ideal that the climber moved and transferred over the left hand to the next placement because of the shallow hold which is not a very good hold to hold on for quite some time. So what also helps is the climber keeping the leg extended helps the climber to twist over to the left side which the climber being close to the wall on his left side will help the climber when going up for the reach. here the climb could be potentially a sit-down start where the climber will have to apply the feet onto the wall and pull on the grips to come from a sit start on to the wall but in this case the climber is applying it seems as a step up start meaning that the climber is placing first the left foot then raises the hips so that the climber is able to apply the right foot onto the next hold so depending on the type of climb that the climber is on could be a step up start what could be a sit start so on this one it's unsure as if the climber is starting it the right way The climber had quickly engaged on a forceful pull up to engage more grip power and quickly sends the right foot onto a high placement. Now the climber is being crunched up and he needs to think on getting out of this move. Reason why the climber is glancing over to the next hold. As we can see the climber was able to reach the left hand onto the next hold. This one has some small grooves so the climber needs to place the fingertips inside of those grooves and have the fingertips catch behind one of the edges of the hold creating friction. In order to sustain the grip the climber sends the weight by pushing the hold down and on pulling on it the climber needs to continue to keep the elbow low underneath the grip. Now the climber we can see how his left foot has come out of place due to the forceful push and had transfer over the way to the right foot. Now the climber is engaging into a forceful pull up in this instance to sustain himself onto the wall until he can position his feet at a new stance and able to move up. Here the climber has lowered the left hand that was positioned low in the hueco to the start hold. This one he does it so the climber is able to stabilize himself on the right hand grip and right now the climber continues to keep the feet on the wall matching the hold down below. So as the climber finds a way to stabilize himself in to the right hand hold then the climber will be able to perform the next move. The climber release the right foot and quickly brings the heel into a high placement. This one the climber brings the right foot to come into a match where the right hand is and as we know the climber is sustaining to a positive edge at the right hand so the climber sends the heel to be placed on top of the hand where his left hand previously was and has the heel placed behind the edge of that groove inside the hold. Heel hooks are known to be strong foot placements as the climber once gets to secure the heel hook onto the hold then he will be able to push down on that heel to gain height and also to pull the heel against that edge which are the same motions that a hand placement would do. So think of the heel almost acting as a third hand. Now the climber was able to adjust his right hand to grip into the side of the holds to allow space for the left hand to come up for a match. Now the climber must sustain the hold showing control and a civility on the position that he is in order for the climb to be completed. The climber originally had to keep the right foot in place when making the reach of the left hand up to the pinch. But when doing the forceful reach and push, the climber's right foot had dropped going out on a swing. Quickly the climber has regained position by placing the right foot back, which can add more unnecessary moves for the climber in this sequence. here we can see that the right hand is not only on a small ledge we can see how the fingers actually get to be wrapped around that edge so it makes it more positive than originally what we thought it was a groove. So the climber can give it extra power and as we can see the climber is now engaging into a forceful pull-up this because the climber needs to obtain control over the swing and reason why he engages on a pull-up. This one the climber will have to engage on the core in order to bring his feet back into place at the wall Here we can see the climber continuing to have the left leg extended and pointing it out to the right side. The left leg extended helps the climber to keep his left side towards the wall as it will help the climber when going up for the reach. Also it helps the climber to keep his center of gravity close to the areas of support. As we can see this is a back flag because it's folded behind the right leg and as the climber was gaining height he needed to pull himself in for that reach and also the back flag he would add extra pressure to stay in place when going for the reach by tapping the toe against the wall. On this one the climber has tapped the hold on a hold that is not on the sequence which could determine that if he had done the climb correctly. As we can see the climber is struggling right now because of the small weco meaning that not both hands can fit inside of the hold so only a few fingers are able to meet the lip of the hold. Now that the right hand has come into place the climber is placing the hand to be towards him so the climber in order to sustain that grip he needs to pull the elbow in with the left hand that's being in place and on the other hand the climber is finding a way to have the grip facing him so he will need to lean back to the left side in order to apply pressure. What he needs to do in this instance is to lean and apply pressure on the hand that is placed the highest so the climber is able to release the left hand for the next move. Since this was a committed move of the climber going up for a hold at reach while he was over onto the right side, when he made the push of the toe against the wall and curved body, he then immediately dropped the weight, pushed on the toe and that gave it extra force for the climber when going up for the reach. Boosting that moment, the climber must secure the grip as soon as he makes the reach and squeezes the hold to sustain his weight coming into place. As the climber made the reach that is at 12 o'clock, meaning directly over him to the last hold, we can see how he continues to press down with the left hand on the flat edge. This is when the climber sends the elbow to the left to apply pressure, and it cannot be pushed down because the climber is in front of the hold. The reason why the climber throws the elbow to the side is to maintain his center of gravity directly underneath the hold that is at reach. And as we can see, also the right foot that is being in position against the hold, the climber is pushing it to the right side. This one so that the climber is able to gain leverage between him pushing in both of the holds that he has his contact with in order to gain height. The left foot being extended helps the climber to continue to apply pressure with the right foot. And as the climber had gained height, he presses the toe against the wall so that the climber can stay at position once had gained the height. As we can see the climber is shaking his hands. This will help the climber warm up the hands as well as releasing any tension that may be built up before the climber gets to start the climb. As the climber secure the right hand on the match, quickly the climber brought the right foot to come into place, placing it on the inside of the hueco and pushes on the right side of that edge. This one so the climber when he engages on the push, he will be pushing down to the right, which will help the climber when going out for the direction for the next move. Now the climber quickly drops the left toe from its place, extending the leg. This is flagging and that helps the climber to bring his center of gravity over to his right foot. The leg being flagged also helps the climber to keep his left side close to the wall as it will aid and support the climber when once releasing the left grip to go up to the next hole, the climber stays close to the wall. The climber had applied the left foot over the right foot to continue to apply pressure. And right now the climber is going by feel, but the foot placements that the climber did is because eventually once the climber was able to move, he would press forcefully on the left toe so it can come immediately into placement when the climber is ready to release the right toe from its place. It's important the climber has control over releasing heel hooks since they provide a lot of force due to sustaining a climber making a series of moves or having one big powerful move. The heel can, once is released, can provide a lot of force when being out of it, if not in control. So the climber quickly sends the left hand to come into placement to another pinch. Both of the grips are safe grips and positive grips where the climber is able to wrap the fingers catching on an edge. So if the climber is able to support the swing by holding on to the grips tight, then the climber will be able to recover going back to the wall. But if the grips were not secured, then it'll be hard for the climber to recover from an uncontrolled release of a heel hook. It's important that the climber always glances over at the foot placement. This one, the climber has brought the left toe that was out on the flag to come into place and match the hold below. Matching is when both of the limbs are in one hold. So right now he is applying pressure evenly into both of them to transfer the weight for the climber able to push down on the hold on the right direction. This will help the climber when needing to release the right hand to come and join the small hueco that the climber's left hand is on. This one is a sharp edge so the climber must continue to apply pressure by curling the fingers inside of the edge of the hold. He adds the weight by keeping the arm extended. When the climber is ready to move, he will have to engage on the arms by bending them to send over the right hand. The climber will be able to hold on to this dynamic move where he cuts feet, cutting feet meaning that the feet are not on the wall, only the grips. The climber is able to sustain this potentially because of the grips being in place are both held as a pinch, which the climber can incorporate extra power onto the grips by pushing the thumb for the squeeze. The climb will start until the climber is stable onto the start holds and as we can see the climber has placed the right foot and brought the knee inwards this so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the highest foot and raises the hips out of the mat meaning that the climb has started. The climber was able to make the next reach of the right hand being released from the matching hold with the heel hook. This one before the climber made that transition of the right hand over he had extended the left foot to come into a placement down below. As we see the climber is able to maintain position by pushing down on the left pinch hold and pushing down on that heel against the hold. Now that the climber is able to secure the right hand grip onto a positive hold, this one because it's a jug, the climber will be able to have this right hand be reliable for when the climber needs to release the heel hook since it's at distance. The climbers is starting at a two hand hold start. As we can see the right hand is placed on a pinch hold, meaning that it's a block in which the climber has two sides, one where he adds the fingers onto the right side of the hold, and on the inner area the climber applies the thumb. This one, so the climber can squeeze the hold, creating a clamp motion, and to apply pressure, the climber will rely on holding his weight by pulling on the hold. The left hand, this one the climber places it on a closed grip because the hold has a shallow edge, and on the side the climber will add the thumb to squeeze onto the hold to remain with pressure by keeping the elbow down to apply weight to it.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Notice how this connection here could be a lot stronger so they can push and pull and tug each other and kind of flick the wrist to let them know where their partner should go. Also, think about the carriage of the arms or the port de bras. Notice how a lot of times the elbow is facing towards the ground. That elbow needs to be up and lifted so that they're able to move together as a unit, but also create really strong shapes and space. Here I will repeat some of my previous comments about making sure that they are clear on how each other plans to interpret the rhythm. I would encourage the dancers to take some time to really learn the rhythm because they're offbeat a lot of the time. Here I repeat some of my previous comments about rhythm, about having a strong frame, about being grounded, about being clear about what the steps are, where to put your arms in space. All those details are really, really, really, truly important. But I do love that they are enjoying each other's company, and they look excited and energetic to be there. This is another moment where I really would encourage the dancers to do some deep investigation of musicality and embodiment of the rhythm because sometimes it looks a little awkward and stiff. So really learning how each other interprets the music but also how they interpret the music as individuals. I would encourage the dancers to make sure that they're grounded the entire time, so their hips are pushing back and that they're in this deep plie, so then they can really cut and curve across space and really fly more than they are so now. They're doing a good job of moving across space, but I definitely think that there is room for improvement.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Bending her knees more would help her be more mobile and also still shifting her weight and traveling different directions. But not bending her knees is making her a bit stiff and is not aiding her mobility. When the dancer is doing the rock step forward, she's doing it incorrectly. She's stepping forward with her left foot, which is good, but then she should be stepping backwards with her right foot. Instead, she's moving her left foot both forwards and backwards. She should not be doing both of these steps. She should be alternating left and then right. The dancers also doing these triple steps these steps one two three very small She's staying in a very small designated area of space the dance floor here. She has a lot of width here Understandable that she it might have to be cut a little bit because of the camera Um panning and how much room she has but so she has a lot more room than she's using So she really needs to be taking larger steps and dancing more full The dancer needs to pick her feet further off the floor when she's doing these triple steps and even the rock steps She is stepping but she's not lifting her feet high enough If she lifts her feet higher off the ground or all of her footwork will be more articulate The dancer again still is dancing flat, flat footed, her feet are flat on the ground. If she lifts the back of her foot, if she lifts her heel off the ground, she would be able to maneuver both forwards and backwards in each direction, shifting her weight from right foot to left foot much more easily. When the dancer does the triple step backwards, she should be doing three complete steps. Instead, she only does two steps. So anytime she's doing a triple step, it really needs to be one, two, three. That rhythm has to be clear and that execution of her feet alternating have to be clear. When the dancer does these triple steps horizontally, it should be three very concretely clear steps. It's not so clear in how she's executing it. Step two is getting a little bit muddled in there. It should be again three very concrete Adamant steps. On step two of the triple step here, she's coming forward with her left foot. However, on a triple step, her left foot or that second foot, in this case, it's her left foot, should not be in front of the other foot. It should be trailing behind the other foot. In this case, her left foot should be trailing behind her right foot. It shouldn't be crossing in front of it. So for a triple step, in this case, when it was right, left, right, right foot should be in front, then left foot should meet it but not pass it, and then right foot should be in front again. In this case, her left foot is passing beyond her right foot. The dancer is not dancing in rhythm on this rock step, triple step, triple step. She should be going back, one, forward, two, going to the horizontally to her right, three and four, and then going back horizontally to her left, five and six, and then stepping backwards seven again, four and eight. So this rock step, triple step, triple step, rock step should be one, two, three and four, five and six, seven, eight. She's not executing that rhythm in time with the music. Those are the counts of the step, but the counts have to be adapted into the timing of the music. When the dancer is crossing her foot behind and then stepping forward She should be on her toes Her weight should be pushed towards her toes Her heels or the back of her foot should be lifted off the ground that way she could be more mobile with more ease But that's not what's happening here. She is on her feet flat", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

On the right side of the frame we can notice on the player's release of his right-handed reverse layup again that the player is jumping with full maximum effort allowing the ball to gain more momentum and arc and needs to get above the rim and also does a good job of squaring his shoulders towards the rim on his release allowing a better angle for the ball to be guided accurately towards the target area and getting his follow through high above his shoulder on his release allowing the ball to again gain more momentum, arc and accuracy to get above the rim and to be guided properly towards the correct target area. The third does a good job as we look on the right side of the frame on his jumping motion going into his reverse layup attempt of using the correct foot by jumping off his left foot, allowing his body's momentum to guide him towards the right side of the rim. And also does a good job of getting his ball placement position above his shoulders, allowing a quicker and closer gap of releasing the ball towards our target area, allowing more ball security and control and separation from opposing defenders. As we look at the player go into his right-handed reverse layup attempt, a slight adjustment we will want to make is to bring the player's ball placement position higher as we look on the right side of the frame, towards the shoulder area, preferably above his shoulders to create a closer gap of releasing the ball quicker towards our target area, creating more ball security and control in the finish, and also creating a greater separation from opposing defenders in a game-like scenario, having access of stripping, taking, or stealing the ball from the offensive player. As we look at the player go into his right-handed reverse layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice that the player does really well at getting lower in his athletic stance, allowing his drive to become quicker, more balanced, and more explosive on his jump going towards his finish. The player also does a good job of getting his eyes locked in on his target before his initial drive, creating a much easier finish at the rim and also increasing his court awareness to be able to take off properly going into his layup attempt. The player also does a good job as we look on the right side of the frame of jumping with full maximum effort, having his shoulders squared towards the rim, allowing the ball to gain enough momentum, arc, and accuracy to get above the rim, to have the opportunity of being guided properly towards our target area. As we look on the right side of the frame on our player's right-handed reverse layup attempt, again, we can notice that the player does a good job of getting a great lift off the ground, helping the ball create more arc and power to get above the rim to hit our target area. Also does a good job, again, of squaring his shoulders towards the back of the rim, creating a better angle for the ball to be directed to accurately, and also does a good job of getting his follow-through high above his shoulders, creating a higher release, giving the ball a better opportunity of accurately being guided towards our target area. As we look at the release of the player's right-handed reverse layup attempt on the right side, again, we can notice that the player does a good job of jumping with full maximum effort, allowing the ball to gain more momentum and arc it needs to get above the rim. The player also does a good job of scoring his shoulders on his release, creating a better angle for the ball to be guided properly. As we look on the left side of the frame, the player does just that by having his follow-through snapping towards the direction of our target, allowing the ball to be guided right towards our target area, the top right corner of the box on the backboard, allowing it to develop the proper angle it needs of dropping inside the rim, resulting in a completed layup attempt. The player also does a good job as we look on the right side of the frame of keeping his ball placement position level towards his shoulder area, creating more ball control and security on the finish, and also creating a closer gap of releasing the ball quicker towards our target area, and also allowing some separation from opposing defenders in a game-like scenario being able to strip, take, or steal the ball. As you look at the player go into his right-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice on the right frame the player does a good job at incorporating the correct footwork by initially stepping with his right foot first and jumping off his left leg, carrying his body's momentum towards the right side of the hoop. The player also does a good job of keeping his eyes locked in on his target, creating a much easier finish and also keeping two hands on the ball before the release, creating more ball control and security on the finish. As we look on the release of the player's right-handed reverse layup attempt, on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player did a good job of getting his follow-through going towards the direction of our target, which allows the ball to be guided with the proper rotation and needs an arc to get above the rim to hit our target area, the top right corner of the box on the backboard, allowing the ball to develop the proper angle needed to drop inside the rim, resulting in the completed layup attempt. As we look at the player on the right side of the frame going into his right-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice that the player did a good job of having his body placement position lower in an athletic stance, allowing his drive to become quicker, more balanced, and more explosive on his jump towards the right side of the rim. The player also does a good job, again, of getting his eyes locked in on his target, creating a much easier finish. And increasing his court awareness. As we look at the player go into his jump on the right side of the frame on his reverse layup attempt, we can notice that the player does a great job again of jumping with the correct foot, having his right leg drive into the rim, allowing his body's momentum to carry him towards the right side of the hoop. As a result, we can see the ball is going inside the rim from the player's right-handed reverse layup attempt, resulting in the completed attempt. As we look at the player's release on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player did really well at getting his follow through going towards the direction of the target, allowing the ball to be guided properly towards our target area, the top right corner of the box on the backboard, allowing the ball to develop the proper angle it needs to drop inside the rim.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Climber is then able to swim the right hand into this green hold and get into a match and top the boulder. So here we have the climber one move in on the start of this boulder. We're going to end on this brick pinch and then left hand end on this little Waco crimp. Karma then campuses into this salad dish pinch. It's in the salad dish line, I don't know why. You can go left hand up into this flat rail here. And the boulder's pretty much done, I think, when you hit this left hand. And after matching this orange plate hold here, climbers able to roll out into this left pinch and they cut their feet and are just barely able to hold this swing. Can I even see just how hard the climbers grabbing with this right hand attempting to stay on the boulder. So really good effort here. And the climber does this really interesting thing where they're able to match in the Waco crimp but then they leave their left hand and recycle it back to the start hold. This allows the climber to get in on this right hand really, really good and exactly the place that they want it.

As we look at the player's release on his right hand, I can lay up attempt on the right side of the frame. We can notice that the player does a good job of extending his follow through in the direction towards our target area as we look on the left side of the frame. However, a slight improvement the player can make to create more power and arc to guide the ball above the rim. As we look on the right side of the frame, is to have the player jump with full maximum effort, getting more lift off the ground to again allow the ball to gain more power, momentum, and ease to get above the rim. Hit our target area and develop the accurate angle it needs to drop inside the rim. As we look at the player go into his right-handed mic and layup attempt, a few improvements the player can make to become more efficient on his attempt as we look on the right frame is to bring his ball placement position above his shoulder. As we see the ball is quite low level towards the player's stomach. This allows a longer distance to release the ball towards our target area. If the player brings the ball towards his shoulder area or above his shoulder area, this will ensure a quicker release towards the ball being guided in the direction of our target. Quicker than the ball being leveled lower towards the stomach. As we look on the right side of the frame, another detail the player does really well is getting his shoulders squared towards the back of the rim to allow the ball to be directed accurately towards our target area. We can have the player square his shoulders even more, slanted, to give the ball a better angle. However, the player still does a good job of getting the ball towards our target properly and having it develop the proper angle of knees. We notice on the left side of the frame the player does a good job on his release, having his follow through go towards the direction of the target which allows the ball to create the amount of spin it needs, and rotation, accuracy, and arc to get above the rim, hit our target area, and develop the proper angle it needs to drop through the net, resulting in a completed layup attempt.

The player did do a good job of using the correct footwork and jumping off the right foot. However, if we look on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player directed the ball on the outside of our target area, which does not allow the ball to develop the proper angle it needs to get above the rim. Instead, we'll hit the side of the rim, bouncing out, resulting in an incomplete layup attempt.

Player also does a good job of locating his target with his eyes to create a much easier finish. A slight improvement we want the player to make is to be lower in his body placement position in an athletic stance to ensure a more balanced and more explosive finish.

If you're just doing regular layups. Well, for the sake of the drill, we should be more so underneath the basket as mentioned previously. But since she decided to take a wide step, this gives her a better angle to potentially make the layup. Body, straight up, not a bad level of talent, like I said, just understanding the principles of jumping off one leg and the other, but keeping your hands on the ball as well. The ball touching the ground is not ideal. I know sometimes mistakes happen. But just knowing if your hands are extended, if your hands are up, it gives you the earliest chance of hitting the ground.

Again, love the flexion, cocking of the wrist if you say. The ball, you know, he's got his fingers spread. Good, you know, balance with his hand on the ball, guide hand on the side. Let's spread those feet a little bit for good base of support. Here's a good look at the follow-through. Pretty good here. Again, let's pull this left guide hand, non-shooting hand elbow in. It's kind of a little bit out, and you can see it's probably in this shot here. Let's get it out of the shot. Here, his extension of his elbow needs to be a little higher. You can see him really not snap the wrist back. It looks like he pulls it back. Let's point these fingers down. I love the guide hand here on the side. Again, let's pull that right elbow, that non-shooting guide hand down to the floor. You really don't need it to be extended. Here, good extension, you know, he's got his guide hand here on the side, let's bring that elbow in of the non-shooting hand, good extension of the hips, but no jumping at all here. And again, if it was a free throw, fine. You know, you're stationary, you know, you don't want to like, doing a lot of jumping on your free throw, just a nice soft touch, but for this drill, let's power, let's lift, let's explode into the air. Again, this is a really good look. This is really nice. Look how he's got his fingers spread on the ball. Nice hand placement. The guide hand looks like it's on the side. Let's get this elbow in tighter, but looks really, really good here. Again, he is bending his knees to get some lift. If this was a free throw, you don't need to jump, you know. I would still spread my feet a little bit, but I love how he's probably looking over the height of the ball here at the rim. Again, if this was a free throw, I'd say, okay, I'm not sure this is a free throw. It's more supposed to be a mid-range jumper, so it lets jump, but a free throw, you don't want to jump. But again, great extension of that elbow. Maybe the elbow is pointed out a little bit to the left. Let's get it in, and let's get this guide hand forearm pointing parallel to the floor. Good extension here of the hips. I would love for him to hold that follow through until the ball hits the rim. He kind of drops both arms back. He's kind of, you know, locked knee if you will. His feet are, you know, let's get the feet apart, you know, absorb the shock by bending the knees. Hold that follow through. Again, no jumping here. Again, I'd love to see more explosiveness here. That follow-through maybe is out in front of him and across his body. Let's get it more straight. But not bad at all. Here on the follow-through, the ball's in the air. Good arc. He has a really good arc on the ball. That's what you want to see. It's not flat. It has a chance. But again, he just, on his landing, he's just straight up. Feet are together. In fact, he might be a little off balance here, falling back. Let's hold that follow-through. Good knee bend. Let's get that right, or if he's left-handed, I would prefer the left foot in front with the right foot slightly behind. Just really good base of support. I can't tell you the distance, but it needs to be what I call a staggered stance. I like how he's got the ball sitting here. Like, this is right before the release. He's bringing it back. I don't think he's bringing it too far back. I think this is okay. But I love how he's got that wrist cocked back, ready to release the ball. The guide hand may be a little bit around in front of the ball, but not bad at all right here. Again, just using a lot of his upper body, very little leg strength. He has been in his knees. He does go up on his toes, but he's gonna get a lot more power. A lot of his shots are ending up short. They're hitting the front of the rim, and when you're short, you've got to use your legs. Love the hand placement. Great job there with that. Here in this shot, I assume this is a, you know, jump, mid-range jump shot from the foul line. You know, he is using all his upper body. You know, he's not even, he hardly even goes up on his toes. You know, his feet are together. I would really, really recommend him stepping back and really driving his legs and hips into meeting this pass to get more lift and elevation. But, I mean, he's not, it's all upper body here. And that's tough. You know, you want to use your whole body in the shot. If you look in the ego frame, he does appear to be left-handed. I do love the extension of the left shooting arm and elbow. It's in line with the basket. It looks like he's snapping that wrist down with the fingers. His guide arm, his non-shooting hand, I'd bring this elbow in. But not too bad here. It looks like he is shooting just with his left hand. I would love that palm to be facing in. However, let's bring that elbow in of the non-shooting hand. Again, great look here, great hand placement on the ball. He is bending his knees. Again, we'd love for him to lift. Drive those hips into that pass and jump. Better extension of holding that follow-through, like that. Again, he kind of locks out his knees. Let's bend those knees. Good extension, love to get some lift and elevation here, good extension here and snapping of the wrist on the follow through. Here it appears to come off, good extension comes off that wrist, let's snap that wrist down, again move that non-shooting elbow in. Love again to see more lift and explosion here. Again, you know, ideally if this is a drill that emphasizes mid-range jumping, he should, he's just standing straight up, a non-aggressive type of posture. I would love for him to be, you know, have his weight down, knees bent, feet moving, and you step left right into this pass. Here he's just standing here waiting for it. Again, if it was a free throw, then fine. Again, I do better knee bend here. I would spread these feet a little bit and have more base of support and balance. His feet are so close together, but I love the knee bend, the dropping of the hip. Again, check out his hands. Looks like that shooting hand is behind the ball. Let's get this guide hand on the side. I love how he's looking at the rim. It looks like the ball might even be blocking his vision here, but it might just be the momentum of him bringing it up and back.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So one going straight down Then two palms up kind of under clinging it to move up to the top So if you didn't kind of realize this would be a huge move up to this orange one He's able to kind of under cling it and just drive his feet up through it So once again, it's a dynamic move up to this green hold and you can see at the start he kind of is moving back and forth left to right, kind of prepping the movement. This is a kind of a bad way to get into a diagonal because it kind of lets you practice like shifting your weight and getting your weight close to the wall and kind of building up to the jump. Now you can see that when he does hit it, he hits it pretty fast and is able to get his left hand up on the two. So the moment his right hand's on there, he's not waiting to get that left hand. Two hands is better than one. He's kind of tucking his feet too, so you can see his feet are being a little bent. So when he swings back, he doesn't have this really long lever that he's got to hold, because then that weight is just multiplied at the end. So by breaking the feet, he kind of breaks up this lever and shorts his body and gives himself a little bit more mechanical advantage in holding the swing.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So still seems very tricky on the ball taking lots of different stops pushes turns Chopping the ball moving it forward stopping it pulling it back lots of directional changes I'm adding in variety with like touch type on the dribble not much variety on the skill moves that are happening but nonetheless a high tempo with a very Large amount of touches we are Close to three minutes in in this video and the tempo is still the same so good quality And endurance shown in this one Just to touch on the scissors, we saw single scissors earlier where right foot comes around and then left foot comes through and we go opposite direction of the scissors. This one here is a double scissors so we've seen one scissors this way, the next scissors coming around this way and then a right foot touch in this direction here. Same ideas here, players that are proficient doing these, they can do treble scissors if they want, they can go quadruple. The idea is to make a defender unsure, maybe read the defender's stance, their balance, what way they're more likely to defend and then it's about going past the defender. So in this case we've had scissors around the first time, scissors around the second time to where this foot is right now and as we're about to see here, there's a touch, going to take it that way, so again just unbalancing the defender and taking the ball into a new space. So a nice feint here where the ball is just being pulled in this direction. So it's coming from here. You can see this foot. This is coming in from this direction here. And it's going to fake a touch that would bring the ball this way. So if there's a defender coming from here to get that ball and they see the foot coming across this way instantly they're going to be drawn into this area. The defender steps their foot down in this area. The ball continues to roll slightly this way. And then they nudge the ball to the right. So just a little feint, a little evasive shoulder drop to open space. Again, last few seconds we've seen a double scissors, we've seen an L turn, we've seen a Cruyff turn up here. So kind of a mixture of the same three, four skills at the moment, just in different contexts, different areas, maybe combined with different skills. So still room for more variety, but the tempo is still pretty high, not many steps between touches still, so the player is pushing the speed of this one quite high. and a single scissors here just after another L turn which was Brought this way, but if we look and see the single scissors here We can see this right foot has come from here around the ball To where it is now And it will end up around here somewhere We then get the left foot to come from This area Through the ball so the idea here is as Both feet as this at least the right foot moves around and steps in this direction If this person even here is a defender and they are approaching the ball they see Foot move this way, so they're going to be more inclined to move in this direction This obviously takes them out of this space here And that's where the left foot comes through and knocks it past so we want the fender In around here so we can go to This space here, so the purpose of a single scissors Is to move a defender one way so we can go the other way So we're still seeing a high tempo here but we've just seen a couple of Cruyff turns, a couple of L turns and a double scissors. So although the tempo is high we're seeing moves being recycled and a developing trend of 3 or 4 of the same moves being used over and over again. So again we had a nice double scissors up here, bringing the ball down this direction and now an L turn in this direction here. So here we're in between a pull push, so kind of a V-shaped pull push. The ball has been pulled back and pushed out. It's going to be pulled back to where it is here and we can see the foot here is going to push the ball in this direction so it's back here to here in a V-shape, kind of a pull push V turn. We're seeing a high pace, high tempo set straight from the start in this video. As we can see the player has entered from this side. They've taken a touch step, touch step, kind of a rhythm pattern into this one where the right foot has taken a step between each touch. This is then followed up by a double scissors into another touch which is then followed up by an L turn into then a change of foot. So we've seen within the first about 3-4 seconds we've seen high tempo dribbling, we've seen high quality double scissors, we've seen a quick touch and then a quick change of direction with an L turn, then into a swap of foot. So the bar has been set high at the start of this video. Still seeing some consistency on the standing foot, the non-ball touching foot, getting close to the ball to allow this touch step dribbling to continue. So the player doing a very good job at staying close to the ball at all times. And here just adding some additional moves and combinations onto a Cruyff. So you can see the inside of the left foot is about to knock the ball towards the inside of the right foot here. Right foot will be turned this way to then sweep the ball behind the body, which is very similar to a Cruyff turn, but we're just adding in the inside move across. And then a quick sweep back in the Cruyff motion. Just to look at the body shape and the stance on the touch step dribble. So the right foot has touched the ball and it has taken a step. So the ball has moved from here to where it is right now. Notice the left foot, the toe is past the ball. So the player, in other words, is getting very close to the ball to ensure that after every step they take, they are able to bring this foot and to give the ball another nudge again. So they are in ultimate control of the ball. This is handy in tight spaces to keep control of the ball, not allowing it to get too far away from her body and to give other players a chance to take it away. So a very good technique to have in a player and to learn to keep full control of the ball. So we're still seeing quite a high tempo here, the players really making an effort to keep the ball moving to not take too many steps between each touch and also to stay close to the ball at all times while it is moving at quite a decent tempo So with this the player being on a freestyle dribble is going to have to think of combinations and moves while the ball is moving and while they're trying to keep it moving We have seen some good variety so far but I still feel like there's a little bit more room for a couple of more variations of moves and a couple of more combinations and skills This part here we are seeing a Cruyff turn so we can see that the inside of the foot is facing behind the player almost. Facing this direction which is the direction the ball is also going to move. As we can see here the standard foot is stepped in right beside, bent leg. Which can sometimes be used to make it look like the player is going to kick the ball straight ahead. To take a shot or to pass it and then the direction is changed the opposite way at the last second with the inside of the foot scooped behind. So this is called a Cruyff turn.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He would have made the correct beat of the music and he would have stayed on top of the music and stayed on the beat. In the beginning, the dancer is doing a bachata steps where he's stepping side together, step and touch, and then going to the other direction, going left and right. He's doing the basics of the step correctly, and I think this first part could easily be taught to any level, definitely a beginner, any age, but he should work more on moving the rest of his body correctly. So it should have a nice snakey flow of the body from the bottom up, so really stepping a little more lightly on those toes, bending the knees a little bit, and then making sure to sway the hips back and forth. I do like that on this part you hear the music kind of change a little bit and he is also transitioning so he's turning around and I'm assuming that he's doing this with the partner because he's raising his arm and saying spins so if he does have a partner one is the leader you want to make sure that you are on the correct beat of the music because the leader is leading but it is cool that he's still showing what it could look like if there was a partner in the piece So when he changes directions, he's not doing the bachata step necessarily, but he's keeping the same rhythm. So step, step, step, touch. For the transition, he's going step, step, step, step, and then rotating his body around to face the other direction.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Again, here they were performing the major scale hands together, taking their time to make sure the crossing technique went successfully. There, the pianist attempted to play the ascending scale with both hands together, slowly. The pianist is demonstrating a C major scale. First they played with their right hand and now they just played with their left hand. It would help to slow the speed of their practicing down to help work on the crossing of the left hand fingers. Here the pianist is demonstrating a bit of playing with a wider range of notes with a lot of crossing technique. It would help if they slowed this section down when practicing, curved their fingers a bit more, and pressed more using the finger pads rather than the tips of the fingers or the nails. When the pianist slowed down their tempo when performing the major scale, they were more successful with their crossing and getting a clearer sound quality. Here they correct it, they're crossing making sure the third finger landed on the next pitch. The pianist is demonstrating the first note that they will play in the piece. They play both the first note with the thumb and the highest note that will be in that first phrase with the pinky to set up their hand position. The ascending portion of the C major scale was performed by the right hand. The pianist properly crossed the thumb to the fourth pitch after playing the first three pitches with fingers 1, 2, and 3.

By doing that they are only utilizing a right foot on the wall that's behind the body so we can't really see. I believe their next left foot would be this yellow foot right here. So because she only has her foot over to the right and she's crossing over with her right hand into this undercling hold with her left foot not even placed on the wall, this is making it very difficult for the climber to be able to transition into using the undercling hold because realistically in order to be able to use that undercling hold the climber needs to completely transition their body weight from the right side over to the left side but because they have no feet over on the left side this is kind of an impossible thing to do. So I would definitely encourage the climber to either start with their left foot on the yellow hold if they want to try and complete this movement here or look into doing an alternative beta so then that way she has a better chance of being able to use the hands and feet that given to her because if you ask me doing this beta in the way that she's attempting to do it is a very difficult thing for her to complete and I would recommend a different alternative way.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Again the player is really wrapping his foot around the right side of the ball, also underneath the ball and that's because the angle of approach is coming from a very square wide angle so as he's trying to get the ball but going back to the ground he's having to wrap his foot around the outside of the ball to bring it back towards the goal. So the angle of approach is going to vary the contact point to get the ball travelling where he wants the ball to go. But here we can see obviously the non-kicking foot is pointing towards the goal, the contact point between the ball and the foot is effectively going to help the ball travel in that same direction. Knees not in a bad position, it's in a decent position in terms of the ball but again we can see the player not really utilising his upper body for that additional balance, control and momentum through the strike. A short approach from the player, just a little kind of half a step towards the ball coming from a slight angle. Again, the player has a tendency to turn his plant foot really to the left and twist away from the goal. So you can see here where the toe we would want to generally be closer to the front edge of the ball, either level or slightly in front to really help control our final follow-through action and our hip placement with the toe pointing to the left and the approach of the player coming from the angle is generally going to bring our follow-through and our rotation through the ball and it's going to affect our potential for angling our foot based on the surface of the foot that the player is looking to use to make contact with the ball. Distance between the ball and the foot is okay, but again the angle of the foot and the direction that it's going is going to have an impact on the player's ability to strike the ball cleanly. The players approach again, very short, coming from an angle, which again is good to open up the hips and the body. Non-kicking foot, we can see pointing in the direction that ideally we would want to get the ball to go, get that toe level with the front of the ball alongside the ball. Three quarters to a four balls width between the ball and the non-kicking foot. So in general the set-up looks okay. You can see the players body position, again not a bad position from the left leg all the way to the left shoulder, but again not using the arms for any real balance or momentum. So a lot of the control and power is coming from the players lower body and we're not really maximising our balance and control and timing with the stroke. Looking at the contact point between the ball, so we can see here maybe utilising more of the instep part of the foot between the laces and the inside. Again we can see based on the preparation the ball is rolling across where the non-kicking foot lands and where the ball is going to be hitting it, the ball is travelling away. So now we're reaching out a little bit more from our body to strike through the ball, so our body is now leaning slightly away to the left and back as we're looking to strike the ball forward. We want to make sure that we're stepping forwards and in and being in a position where we can really strike through the line of the ball effectively with the surface that we choose to strike the ball with. Again, just a follow-through action. So the player does generally keep himself in a decently locked position as he comes through the ball. It's important to keep that ankle locked as much as we can to maximise that firm contact strike through the line of the shot. Again you can see the follow-through is following around in the direction that non-kicking foot is going. That's going to control the effective final position of that follow-through. So unless we are light on our feet and able to work on the balls of our feet and hop through the line of the shot and land on our right foot, that follow-through is going to be limited in terms of controlling the accuracy and power of the shot going forward. So again we can see the hips are now turning to the right, the chest is still facing the ball, non-kicking foot pointing away. So we just lose elements of control and power in the transition from contact to the follow-through. Again, follow through action, very limited here based on the players balance it seems so the left foot lands quickly to the ground so the direction and the power are really related now to the contact between the foot and the ball, the part of the ball we make contact with, the part of the foot we make contact with and then initial back lift and immediate follow through which is limited. So again, direction of the ball, ball is up off the ground so we're hitting the lower half of the ball with the hard surface of the foot with the in step stroke inside so the ball is now travelling forward. Important when we follow through that we try and get our hips and our body following through in that direction, you see here the hips are facing forward but the chest is still facing to the left so we haven't fully rotated our body through the line that we want the ball to go so we lose elements of control and power. Play again using the inside of the foot. Again we can see the player is really wrapping his foot around the right side of the ball. So based on the angle of the foot, the contact area of the ball is obviously going to control the direction or initial direction of the pass, stroke, shot. And then obviously that is more controlled here by the non-kicking foot so the direction that's pointing in, that now right leg is now kind of coming through and rotating around the line of the ball. If we're going to use the inside of the foot, ideally we would have a slight knee bend on contact and then as we follow through potentially move into that straight leg position with a locked ankle to strike through it. Again we can see the non-kicking foot is bending away, hips are well behind the line of the ball, chest leaning back so our body momentum is not moving through the strike so the power control is really generated from the contact with the foot, the back lift and then the follow through. Looking at the contact point between the ball, you can see the player opening up his hip, so can use the inside of his foot. Here you can see the toe looks like it's pointing slightly down, so that means we don't have that potential full lock in the ankle, make a firm contact. And with the toe pointing down means we're gonna hit more of the lower part of the ball, rather than straight through the middle. And we can also see that the player is really opening up his hips to kind of go to the right hand side, non-kicking foot, pointing towards the middle, and the body is leaning away a little bit because of that. So we're gonna try and get our body in a better position in line with that standing foot, so we can really come through the line of the shot as we make contacts. Here the player's head has come up a little bit more than some of the previous actions. In previous actions, the player's been focused on the ball throughout the approach and contact. Here the head looks like it's raising slightly, so taking his attention off the ball could have an impact on the contact point and the quality of the strike. Player choosing to shoot with what is probably deemed to be his weaker foot, which is his left foot. So again, short approach, kind of a half step coming from a slight angle, which is good. It helps player open up his hips and rotate through the ball. Look at the non-kicking foot again, pointing in the direction that we generally want the ball to go. Toe level with the front of the ball. So those two areas, again, the toe pointing is just based on where the player is intending to go. The toe position in relation to the ball is also related to that. We can see the distance from the foot to the ball is probably too big. So as we're now bringing that left leg through the ball, it's going to be reaching out far. So we're going to have elements of loss of balance and control. And then when we lose balance, we lose accuracy and power in the strike. gallwch weld y ffyrdd y mae'r chwaraewr yn gael ei ffyrdd yn seil yn seil yn ystod y ffordd y mae'n dod o'r angl hon, um, unwaith eto, mae'r seil sy'n ddod allan yn y ffordd ddim yn ymgyrchu'r angl o'r ddangos yn rhoi'r ffwrdd o'r ddangos dros ei llwybr yn gyflym, um, gallwch weld wrth i'r ffwrdd o'r ddangos ddod o'r aml i'r ddra, mae'r ball yn hefyd yn ymgyrchu ar y ddra, felly mae ychydig o gysylltiad o'r cyfnod cyfathrebu gyda'r ball a'r ffwrdd o'r ddangos a'r aml i'r ddangos gyda'r chwaraewr, ond mae'r chwaraewr yn dal i gael ei chynnau a'i ches yn rhwngolio i'r ddra y bydd eisiau i'r ball mynd, ond yn ddiweddar, rydyn ni eisiau sicrhau bod ni'n rhoi drwy'r llinell o'r ball a dod i'n ffordd ein bod yn y ddra y mae'r ffwrdd yn mynd. Looking at the contact point with the ball, so we can see the player utilising the inside of the foot. Again, the foot is angled slightly out to the right, so we're hitting the right side of the ball, which is going to direct the ball more towards the left or create a spinning effect on the ball to spin from right to left. We can see from this angle here that it looks like the player is hitting the lower half of the ball on contact, which is going to lead to the ball going up and to the left. We can see the body position on contact, the player is leaning away to the left. It doesn't look from this angle here that we're leaning towards the ball, but leaning slightly backwards and away, so that's going to affect our control and balance and ability to get our follow through, through the line of the ball and get our hips and chest aligned with the direction it's travelling. So in the follow through action we can see the player keeps his foot in a relatively locked position following through in the direction that he wants the ball to go and his follow through action comes up around 45 to 90 degrees from his body so that helps with that follow through, striking through the ball with a firm contact will help us in terms of controlling the accuracy and power of the shot. We just see the impact of the non-kicking foot where that plants and how that relates to this follow-through motion. So the initial follow-through player looks like he keeps his foot in a decently locked position coming straight through the line of the ball before twisting off to the left. But you can see again the chest is facing forwards but the hips are now turning away to the right so we're not maximising our body momentum. Also looks from this angle the player is leaning backwards and away which is going to increase the likelihood the ball is going to travel upwards. But also that we're not getting our body momentum through the line of the shot. And in a game situation could relate to us not being ready for a rebound or following into a shot or lacking elements of control and power also. Here the player is striking a rolling ball so the ball is rolling from the players left side to his right. So this is just going to change slightly the approach to the ball. So the player is coming from a slight angle, stepping alongside the ball. Again you can see non-kicking foot we want alongside the ball, toe slightly in front and level with the front of the ball pointing in the general direction that we want the ball to go. So this ball is rolling away so ideally when we plant the foot we want the foot to be a little bit closer than normal so when we make contact the ball is at that three quarter to a full balls width away from the non-kicking foot so we can strike with good balance. The players body positioning looks ok, hard to tell but we see straight position from the leg to the shoulder. Ideally we want this left arm up and out just to add balance and really open up the body and the hips to bring this back lift and then really rotate his body through the line of the shot. Also important that the player is really focused on the contact point with the ball so we can see from the ego view his attention is really on the ball and to the right not the goal. We can see his head positioning keeping him stable and still so we can really maximise the contact between the ball and the foot. So looking at the contact, we can see player making contact with the inside of the foot. It looks like the contact is closer to the big toe area of the foot. So that rounded area and less surface contact between the ball and the foot means we're just going to generate a little bit less control and power. So we want to strike through the middle of the ball, inside curvature of the foot as much as we can. And again, you can see the player making contact with the lower half of the ball, which is going to increase the height that the ball is going to travel. It's going to come up and away. And again, we can see the non-kicking foot is turning around to the left. So the body is naturally going to be leaning away to the left as he brings his right leg through the line of the shot. And we can see the impact the non-kicking foot has. He doesn't really move his non-kicking foot through the action, keeps that planted to the ground. That really controls the position of the follow-through and the hips, which we want our body to be facing the way that we're playing the shot or playing the pass. So he's rotating his follow-through through the line of the ball, keeping his foot in a relatively locked position, bringing his follow-through up and around. So he's generating some decent power through that action. But again, because of the approach, because of the follow-through, you can see the body is moving away from the direction of the shot. So although he's getting his body aligned, we are losing elements of control and power by not getting our body moving through the line of the shot. And it's looking at the players follow through so there was a little buckle in the ankle as he came through so his foot Originally was kind of angled to the left and as he makes contact with the ball He's told and points out to the right. So although on a freeze frame looks like he's got that ankle locked on contact Maybe not But again the follow through straight leg foot in that position coming through in the general direction that the ball is traveling and Shows elements of control and additional power and see the players chest and hips are more Aligned with the direction that the ball is going to go although the non kicking foot is still very static and stationary pointing more towards the left of the goal and so Better follow-through action better body position from the player But still some elements where we can improve to bring the body forward with the strike And just looking at the follow-through action, following through, generally the way that a non-kicking foot was planted in the preparation, not much movement in this non-kicking foot. We're going to try and follow through with a striking leg and continue to keep our hips, our chest and our body facing the same direction that the ball intends to travel. That just maximizes our control, our power and accuracy. Guys getting decent power in the strikes through the contact point between the ball and the part of the foot that he's choosing. And there is an initial follow-through motion from that back-lift follow-through that's generating the power. But it's interesting in the direction that the shot is going. Here the player similar to the last few is hitting a rolling ball that's rolling from the players left towards his right. His angle of approach when hitting the rolling ball is very wide, ultimately square to the ball so kind of side stepping across with his non kicking foot. Non kicking foot here as he plants obviously he's making an adjustment because the ball is rolling, toe is in a good position in relation to the front edge of the ball, toe pointing in the general direction we want the ball to go is a good guide. Distance between the ball as the ball is rolling is going to be different than a static one so obviously as we plant our non kicking foot next to the ball we want to create this number 10 shape but because the ball is rolling we're going to land our foot a little closer to the ball if the ball is rolling away from us so when we ultimately make contact with the ball the ball is in that 3 quarters to a foot balls width away from the non kicking foot to help the player rotate through the ball. Again you can see the players body doesn't look in a bad position but he's not utilising his arms for that additional balance and getting that full maximum body momentum moving through the strike just by bringing his left arm up and away from his body will open up his chest, open up his hips and really maximise that back lift and follow through motion through the ball. Players approach again very short kind of half to a one-step approach coming from a slight angle which is which is okay. Non-kicking foot again we want to be planted alongside the ball create this 10 shape get our toe pointing in the general direction we want the ball to go and our toe should be slightly in front and level with the front of the ball so depending on the players exact target or outcome looks like the player again is twisting his left foot a little further around which is going to really affect the motion of the right leg coming around and through the ball so we can see the distance between the ball is just a little bit further so he's going to end up reaching for the ball a little bit more again from the body position we can see kind of upright with no real use of the arms for additional balance or to really open up his chest his hips to rotate through the ball Here we can see player keeps his foot in a relatively similar position all the way through into a straight leg with a follow through. We can also see their initial follow through is helping read out control or direct the accuracy of the pass. So the ball right now obviously is traveling on that line before the right foot starts to pivot away towards the left as he tries to regain his balance. Again we can see the player looks like he is leaning back and away from the direction of the shot. So we want to try and make sure we are getting our hips and our chest forward as we are making contact to try and get our body momentum through the line of the shot. And just looking at the follow-through action, you can see obviously the non-kicking foot very planted to the ground throughout the motion. The contact with the ball is really bringing the ball around to the left. You can see the overall follow-through motion is really spinning around in front of his body, not moving his left leg but his right for over. So we'll always turn his hips around towards the ball. You can see his legs are crossing over, his chest is facing the opposite way. So we're not fully fluent in our motion through the ball, helping us with additional control and power. Again, player very short run up coming from a very wide angle, which is leading to the player really twisting the plant leg and non-kicking foot around to the left. So from the angle that the player is approaching, he's going to bring a real rotation around with the risk of pulling the ball way more to the left than the needs be. You can see the position of the toe is well in front of the ball. Distance between the ball is a little close as well. So ideally, we want this foot to be a little closer to in line with the ball, maybe slightly further in front of the ball so we can get our body momentum moving through it. But really depending on the outcome of the strike and the angle of approach. Again, we can see the player is already bending his left knee, which is going to mean our contact with the ball is probably going to be to the lower half of the ball. And we can see the line through the body is very upright and our arms are in by our side rather than out for additional balance and ability to open up our chest and our hips to maximise this back lift and follow through the strike. short approach for the player one step towards the ball again coming at the ball from a quite wide angle based on where the non-kicking foot is pointing and we can see from this angle here the non-kicking foot is really twisted around to the left which is going to have an effect on the position of the right leg coming through the ball and then the follow through action so obviously the further this foot is now planted away from this ball the more we're going to be reaching out with the right leg which affects our balance, control and power so when we plant this non-kicking foot we want to be in a position alongside the ball create this number 10 shape, toe level with the front side of the ball and the distance between the ball and the floor about three quarters to a ball's width just to allow us to maintain our balance and get our body momentum moving through the line of the strike Player again hitting a rolling ball, ball rolling from the player's left side to his right. So when we're in the rolling ball, it's going to change our approach slightly. This player is coming at the ball from a very wide angle. So he's really twisting his left foot around as he's planting, which is going to add kind of extra rotation and maybe overcompensating that rotation as he comes back and around with the right foot, which potentially is going to drag the ball more to his left-hand side. But again, we're going to look at the position of the foot. So alongside the ball, toe slightly in front, if not level with the front of the ball to help bring our body forward, remembering that this ball is rolling away from the body. So we want to make sure we step in a little closer than we would normally create that number 10 shape. But by the time the right leg is coming through the ball, the ball is going to be rolling slightly further away and not to hit the ball too far further than three quarters to a full ball's width away from the non-kicking foot. Again, we can see the player seems to be in an OK position from here, but you can see he's not utilising his arms for balance and control. Left arm really close. We want his left arm to be up and away from his body. It gives him balance, helps with his chest, his hips for greater rotation through the ball and use the right arm to counter that a little bit lower down by his side in the position that he's in. I do like that the player is seeming to maintain focus and visual on the ball throughout the action, which is going to help him maximise the contact point on the ball. Short approach from the player again from a slight angle, which is good. Non-kicking foot alongside the ball, toe slightly in front of the ball, so slightly better position here for the player. Probably decent distance here at the maximum end of the ball's width between the non-kicking foot and the ball, which is positive. I would say the player looks genuinely a little upright here. We want a slight angle as we're approaching the ball to really open up the hips and get that back lift coming through the line of the ball. Again, player recommends you use the left arm to come out for additional balance and momentum to really strike through the line of the ball with the right foot. Again, I like that the player's focus is on the ball during the action. This can help the player in terms of really maximising the contact with the ball, keeping his head down and getting his body momentum through the ball. Again, just looking at the contact point with the ball, heel down, sorry, heel up, toe down. And like we're striking through the middle to low part of the ball, but also wrapping our foot around the right side of the ball. We can see that we're making contact behind the line of the standing foot. So ideally if we're doing this, we're trying to get our knee closer to the line of the ball. You can see based on the non-kicking leg where the body's leaning, it's hard to get that leg in a position with the knee over the ball as we make contact and then strike straight through. Again, arms are really close to the body, not utilizing them for additional balance and control. So there's elements here which look positive, but the body, based on the non-kicking foot and the approach, is in a difficult position to get full momentum going through the ball. Player again making contact more with the instep between the laces and the inside and closer to the top of the foot near the big toe area and with the toe what seems to be pointing down we're making contact again with the lower half of the ball which is going to have an impact on the height and trajectory of the shot. Again I want my players when they're striking the ball to be bringing their hips and their chest and their body through the line where they want to go. We can see here the non-kicking foot is pointing to the left on contact the body is facing more to the right so now we're relying heavily on the contact point between the ball and the foot to control elements of the accuracy and power of the shot. Just looking at the preparation for the player to the ball. So, player coming at the ball from a slight angle, which is going to help in terms of opening up the player's hips, stepping alongside the ball. It's important to get our non-kicking foot in the correct position, toe level with the front of the ball, pointing in the general direction we want the ball to go to help control our follow through action and contact with the ball. And then making sure that we're not too far away from the ball, about three quarters to a full ball's width from the ball to the non-kicking foot to allow enough room for the rotation through the ball, but not far enough away where we're reaching and knocking ourselves off balance. So looking at the contact point, so we can see the player utilising the inside of the left foot to make the strike. We can see the position of the foot, the toe is pointing away and down, so that means that we're most likely going to be hitting the lower half of the ball. We can also see as we're striking the ball here with a straight leg, that could potentially add power to the strike. But if we're going to use the inside of the foot, me personally would like to see the lower leg pointing down more vertical, so we're making contact with the ball where we have flexibility in our knee to bring and then lock our leg as we come through the line of the ball for the follow through. If we're hitting contact with a straight leg, it's probably because we're reaching for the ball, which is going to now lead to the player being a little bit off balance. You can see him leaning back slightly and away to the right, so as the ball is going to be travelling here, the player's body is not going to necessarily be moving through the line of the ball with contact. The player looks to keep a relatively locked position with his foot. Follow through is coming through the line of the ball. Generally, so he's coming across his body here, generally coming in line with the direction the ball is travelling. So the contact point between the ball and the foot as well as an element of the follow through controlling the direction of the ball. You can see his body is starting to twist across where his chest is facing one way, hips facing more towards the ball. So ideally when we strike through the ball we want to try and keep our body position facing the way that we want to go. As soon as we start to twist we start to lose that momentum coming through the ball, start to lose that balance as we slide away to the left. Looking at contact we can see the heel down, toe up so it looks like the player is now striking the ball more with the laces of the foot. But again the position of the body in relation to the ball is very much leaning away to the left with the body upright, no use of the arms for balance and control. So we're really reliant here on the position of the non-kicking foot with the ball and the contact between the ball and the foot for the direction and control and power.

Looking at the contact point, so we can see here the player is really wrapping his foot around the ball and part of this I think is down to the twist in the standing leg that comes from that really wide angle, really twists his left leg around and he's trying to wrap his foot around the ball but here you can see the player is really making contact with the side of the ball and seems to be closer to the ankle than it is the inside, the laces or the instep which is going to affect the control and accuracy, so if the ball hits the ankle or the heel it's going to be a harder surface around the surface, we don't have as much control and accuracy over the direction of the shot we can see that obviously the toe is down, heel is up so we don't necessarily have that flexibility in the strike we're hitting the ball with a really straight leg reaching out with our body leaning away from the ball not utilising our arms for additional balance and momentum to swing through so the player is really relying on the exact contact between the foot and the ball for the direction and power on the shot Player looking to utilize the inside of the foot so we can see the foot slightly angled making contact with the looks like closer to the heel portion of the foot so that's going to have impact on the potential control and accuracy of the intended outcome that the player is looking for so you can see the ball is probably going to veer off to the left hand side and we can see on contact player is making contact with a straight leg on contact for me I'd like a slight knee bend in that right leg as he's making contact through the middle of the ball with the inside of the foot and then turn that into a straight leg in the follow-through potentially I think because the player is in a very upright position there's no knee bend in this left leg makes it difficult for the player to be a little bit more fluent in his action also again for his upright body position and no use of his arms for that additional balance makes it difficult to really move freely through the ball y chwaraewr yn edrych ar ei gysylltiad a'i ddarparu, felly yn dod i'r ball o ffwrdd y byddwn ni'n golygu, ac yna edrych ar y ffordd na'i chwipio lle mae'n ei leuro ymhlith y ball.

Player approaching the ball straight with the right foot, a short approach, one step coming from a slight angle from the left. You can see again the non-kicking foot really planted pointing way to the left. Again the non-kicking foot direction is going to control elements of the body position, the follow through and also the balance in relation to the ball. So we see where that toe is in relation to the front of the ball. So if we're going to go to the left hand side, then obviously the ball is going to be slightly behind that but we can strike through the ball based on the distance between the ball and the non-kicking foot is decent. We can see again the player's body on contact is very, the arms are not being utilised for balance and additional momentum through the ball. We want this left arm really up and away from our body, right arm counterbalances that down, straight position from this ankle all the way up to that left shoulder and then bend our knee as we're bringing that back lift through. That just makes it a broader swing through the ball, generate more power and control. Looking at the contact points with the ball, so it looks like the player is using the inside of the foot. Again, it's difficult from these angles to necessarily see exactly where the player is making contact, but we can see the toe pointing out. And on a slight angle here with the ball, which is going to obviously change the direction of the ball based on the angle of the foot with the part of the ball we make contact with. Normally we are looking to get our hips and our body aligned facing the direction that we want the ball to travel. So based on the non-kicking foot, the body position and then the position of the foot making contact with the ball can control the direction and the outcome of the strike. Again, the follow for action player, very static on the non-kicking foot. So depending on the intended target the player is looking for, he's really relying on the contact between the ball and the foot and then obviously he's rotating his foot across his body through the line. So now we have our chest facing one way, our hips facing another and non-kicking foot facing one way. So he is not maximized in terms of the control and power that we can potentially get from the shot.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The angle here is really, really bad. All right? So, when you get tired, you want to make sure you start up high enough and create that good angle. Right here, the ball is targeted there, great spot on the backboard, great posture of two feet and being able to land simultaneously in order to effectively recover to the defensive end or offensive end. That's good layup here, but right now you want to make sure that left hand is up protecting the ball, protecting the body. Right now the ball is exposed to anyone being able to come up and block it or strip it. So right now, yep, got smart came up a little bit higher to create that better angle to lay it up. So just understanding That the angle can sometimes give you a better chance when you're fatigued Right now fatigue is kicking in, right? So now her posture is definitely changing. That's why you want to make sure you keep a low center of gravity as you're going up and explode up. Keep two hands on the ball and release it at the peak of your jump. As you can see here, the body language, going too fast, she was not able to control herself, which took her out away from being able to lead up at a strong point and not hitting inside the white box. So just understanding your speed, you know, being able to slow down, explode up to be able to finish the wheel. Right here, great job jumping off the left leg, laying out with your right. Right here, as you see the eye is still down. We want to make sure that eyes are up. This is a great job having spatial steps to be able to get to the the basket faster than I. The starting point is pretty good, so just being able to give yourself a realistic try to be able to come gain speed and come down hill versus starting too close or starting at a bad flat angle.

I would encourage the dancer to also dance from their back, especially when they're moving their arms up. Really accentuating from the back and letting it flow through the fingertips creates a more dynamic quality and makes it exciting to watch. I will repeat some of my previous comments about having strength and power behind this movement, specifically right here, and really letting the arms guide where you go next. I would encourage just dancers to have more attack in their movement because they have great musicality and understanding of the intricate rhythms of the dance, but having more attack and precision will take it to the next level. I would encourage the dancer to be more grounded so they can have greater hip articulation.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And also if you take a look at his left guy hand, his palm is facing directly to the right, which is directly in the direction of his right shooting hand. So on the release of the ball, we want our palm to be open and facing in the direction of our shooting hand as we release the ball. And now, as you can see, his fingers are pointing in the direction of the basket, which is perfectly fine. It's all based off of the level of comfort that the shooter has with the placement of their guy hand as the ball is released. The fingers can be pointed towards the basket like this shooter's is, or on the release of the ball, his fingers can be pointed straight up into the sky in this direction. Whichever is the most comfortable on the release for the shooter is acceptable. We just don't want the palm to be facing, pointed towards the ground on the release or pointed towards the basket on the release. That palm has to be open and facing towards the shooter's hand, which is towards the right for a right-handed shooter. And then at the left-handed shooter, they'll be shooting with their left hand and their palm will be open and facing towards the left. From this view you can get a better idea of the hand placement on the ball. He has, as you can see, his right hand is on the right side of the ball. And his left hand is on the left side of the ball and behind the ball. So his hand placement is incorrect as he's raising the ball up above his head. Ideally we would like for this left hand to be back more and on the side of the ball. And having this right hand over more in this direction to where this right index finger, instead of being placed here, is more in this area over here. we don't want our elbow to be too flat on the release because if the elbow is too low and below our eye level it will create a flat shot and we also don't want our elbow to be straight we don't want our arm to be straight up and down because our elbow is too high on the release so now the ball is basically going to go straight up and into the air and fall down short of the basket so we have to make sure that on the release the ball, our elbow is slightly above our eye level which will allow the ball to have that good rainbow arc and still travel in the direction of the basket and go in to make the shot Here the shooter catches the ball and he takes, on the catch he steps with his left foot. So as he steps with his left foot he's going to take and catches the ball he's going to take his right foot and place it into position. This creates the momentum and gives him a good rhythm for his shot. This is called stepping into your shot and he does a good job of stepping into each one of his shots to create a good rhythm for him to be able to make shots consistently. on the release of the ball you can see the shooters elbow is slightly above his eye level this is good placement for our elbow we always want on the release of the ball we always want our elbow to be slightly above our eye level this creates good arc on the ball which will go give it that good rainbow effect and for the ball to go directly into the basket we don't want our as the shooter begins to release the ball he turns his wrist and this action of turning the wrist allows for his hand to be underneath the ball his right index finger is now in the correct position in the middle of the ball and so now the ball is firmly in one hand and now by that action of him turning the wrist now it becomes a one-handed shot he had originally had both hands on the side of the ball so if you would have kept both hands on the side of the ball it inevitably would have became a two-hand push shot but by this slight action as he's beginning to release the ball of him turning his wrist that places the ball firmly in one hand and as you can see with his guy hand he begins to open up his guy hand clearing the path because his hand was originally behind the ball but he opens his wrist kind of like a gateway to clear a path for the ball to go straight out of his right hand and towards the basket. This is a lot of movements that he has in his shot but at the end point of his shot he gets to the correct positioning for the release of the ball ideally we would like to have this hand placement that he has on the release of the ball have that hand placement when the ball is down in this area and he is raising the ball up into that positioning so it's less movement and there's less moving parts in his shot and by having less moving parts in his shot it will make his shot even more consistent and accurate than it already is Looking at the placement of his feet, you see he has a good bend to his knees. His feet are nicely spaced apart and his right foot is slightly in front of his left foot. By having his right foot slightly in front of his left foot, that allows for his elbow to be aligned more with the basket. However, because of the placement, his elbow is still flaring outward. The reason for this is because the placement of his right hand is on the side of the ball. So even though his foot positioning is really good, his hand placement at the start of his shot is incorrect as his right hand is on the side of the ball, which forces his elbow to be out and away from his body.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

But anyway, so what she needs to do is the kind of positive angles below it, so she needs to undercling it, not gastone it and then stand up through it. So, she's trying to shoulder into it, which seems like she's trying to take it to her upper body instead of really walking the feet under and getting into the right position, which is going to be as far up and left as possible. But in order to get there, she's going to have to really drive that right foot and get her weight shifted way far to the left. And then she kind of gives up on that method and goes back to the start and tries to do the big throw out left. You can see she is in the right height, but same thing, she's trying to pull down to that foothold. And what she needs to do is get her foot here and then bring her knee up and over it and shift and really press with this right leg and have the right leg drive her to the left so that she can stand up over that foot.

I think this dancer can have the basics, but they can really start to think about dynamic qualities of movement. So when are they're melting versus when are they hitting it staccato and being really strong and precise, right? Understanding the difference of that makes for a more exciting dance and takes it from a novice to a more professional level. I would encourage them to have more strength and power through their arms even when they're flicking forward. I would encourage them to really use and articulate and dance through their back, not just move their circle, their hands or their arms in a circular position to create a bicycle, but really to have it, their shoulders come up and over and let it move and marinate from the back, right?

So it looks like it's kind of going in directly on the side. I think what he wants to do is Toe him or at the top and then drive his weight up and over So that knee is gonna have to kind of go from this position to being up here So he can kind of toe down straight through the hold We can see with how his leg is, it's kind of pushing him out to the right and he's trying to kind of come up and to the left to hit the next hold. So these two kind of motions are kind of at odds with one another. And so I think the foot's placed to drive him to the right. What he needs to do is place it so he can drive straight down through it and then shift his weight over the foot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So here the dancer did a turn going back and came around. He did a really good job with his energy and stopping himself straight forward. So his legs are straight on the line. And then a nice little shimmy out, nice bend of the knees. And his legs are open really nice. So this dancer, he does a really good job. Like he knows the steps very well, but there's kind of a point where you have to actually dance the movements and really feel the groove. So I think if he would just kind of loosen up a little bit and just really bend the knees, go up on his toes and really move his spine back and forth and his hips side to side, it would have really elevated the performance. So the dancer is also stepping forward and back. I would just suggest that he bends more into the front knee and then gets more on his toes, especially when he's going backwards, keeping his heel off the floor, just to keep the movement much lighter. Also, try to really work the hips side to side. So yes, you're moving forward and back, but your hips are still rolling around side to side. So here the dancer, he just did a spin around, kicking his leg up. And right now he is standing in a small plie bend of the knees. But really nice job isolating this left leg on the twist. The arms are straight up in the air, nice and strong. And he hits the music perfectly with the knee twist. So here the dancer jumps out to the side, really nice spacing in the legs, the arms are back. I would suggest maybe bending the back a little bit more, just kind of going up and down, because it's just a little stiff, bending those knees a little bit more, and really getting low into the jump. So here the dancer does a good job doing a body roll. He really rolls all the way from the top to the bottom. So really nice job in that full transition.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

In this one the climber brings the left foot that was out in space as a flag to come and join at the lip down below which he's ascending on another jug. This one the climber will apply pressure of the left foot towards the edge of the hold in order to release the right foot from its place. The climber right now, coming into a match, he's leaning back by extending the arms, keeping the core tight as well as dropping the left foot to stabilize himself from moving. The climber, in order to reach the hold upright, he had pressed the left toe that was extended as a flag in order for him to have stabilized the move and stay in place once making the reach. This will help the climber to push his center of gravity close to the wall to keep the hips square when making up the reach, as well as helped by the left hand when the climber brought it close to his chest to lock the move in order to send the right hand up. Now the right hand, we can see the entrance of the climber making the hand placement would be on to the right, so he's going to place the fingers behind the lip of that hold and must sustain onto the grip by leaning out left. The climber was able to make the hold that reach and it's important that he always glances down at the feet to make sure that he makes an accurate placement of the foot coming into place. This time the climber brings the right toe to come towards the edge of the hold and in doing so the climber then will transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place. We can see how the climber had made a dynamic move to the right hand making it up for the jug at reach. This one has a large lip where the climber can place the fingertips behind the edge of that hold and able to close the grip he then transfers over the weight to the highest grip as he keeps the arm extended. The clumber is in this place in the left foot. We can see him bringing the hips to rise and pushing down on the right foot to bring himself over to the left side and quickly transitions the right hand over to the next grip, bringing both hands into the same hold. This is called matching. And he's sustaining into a positive hold due to being able to wrap the fingers behind the edge of the hold. The climber is bringing both of the hands to come into a match at the jug in front of him and engages onto a slight pull up to bring his right foot over to be pressed against the wall. This is called smearing when he uses the surface of the wall as a foothold and will be pressing onto it so that the climber can commit to a dynamic move which is to a hold at reach. The climber lowers his center of gravity or keeps tight on the grips and whenever he's ready he will pull himself even harder and boost over with the left foot being in place against the wall. Eventually when the climber gains height he will be transferring over the weight to the highest foot being in place, the right foot. And the left leg will be extended being this time positioned as a flag which means that the climber will be able to balance over his right foot and continue to have a stability over the move when making the reach. Here the climber had kept the hips square, standing over the highest foot and pulling himself up by locking the left arm to make the reach of the jug with the right hand. And then quickly we can see the climber is dropped the right foot, extending the leg. This is called flagging out. The climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. And at this moment the climber is about to release the left hand from its place to bring it over to the next move. When making this move the climber will push down onto that left foot being in place and keep the right leg extended to balance over the move as he continues to make the reach. The climber, after performing the foot switch, he actually made a right foot placement at a higher stance and then quickly moved the left foot also to be placed much higher. Now the climber's center of gravity is laying low when he brought his left hand to come into position where the right hand is, again matching to a jug. Now the climber is glancing over to the next hold, which the climber then keeping the arms extended. This is called the rest position as the arms are not engaged on the bend. So in this moment, the climber can take a moment to rest before moving on, as well as taking the time to assess the wall. The climber quickly sends the left foot to come into a high foot placement which he uses to push away in order to make the transition of the right hand coming over to the last hold. The climber is using a chalk bucket. This contains the chalk. It's a powder that the climber will use to spread out through the surface of the hands in order to gain a better grip when sustaining the holds on the wall. It also helps the climber to absorb any sweat that may be coming from his hands. As the climber made the transition of the right hand over to a jug that's on to the side, he is now releasing the left hand and the left foot is already out in space. So in this moment, the climber will be bar enduring out to the right. So in order for the climber to stop this, he must try to bring the center of gravity underneath his area of support by sending the left foot over to the right and dropping the foot as he brings the left hand to come into place at the match. When the climber had made the right foot placement, we can see his left foot was no longer in contact as he continued to push down on the right foot, gaining height to bring the left hand up to a match. The climber needs to hang on tight to the grips, this will release some of the pressure down at the feet as he commits into a foot switch. Now the climber must bring the left toe to come into place at the hold and applies pressure before releasing the right toe from its place. He needs to also continue to apply pressure down at the feet to avoid him losing the foot placement. The climber is sending the left hand over to a match at the last hold. We can see the climber continues to press onto the left toe to have it in place as he extends the left leg. He does this because he needs to bring his center of gravity underneath his area of support being at the match. Once the climber is able to demonstrate control and stability over the move, then the climb is completed. Since the climbers next hold was one at distance, the climber has then transitioned to press the right foot to extend the left leg. This is called flagging out because it helps the climber to also keep balance over the move. In this case, having the left leg extended, he can balance over the right foot being in place to send the right hand up for a reach and also helps the climber to keep his hips square while engaging on the pull. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start and he's placing the fingers behind the edge of the hold in which indents down onto the wall. Now the climber is starting at a sit start and sit starts are difficult to come off from as it adds a grade to the climb due to the climber having to lift up his weight to transfer it over to the hands and feet. The climber right now is placing his right foot onto the wall and once the climber gets to place the left foot onto the wall and presses down on the feet he will be able to raise his hips off the mat and that's when the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And just completely kind of, by the time he hits this left hand hold, his body's already so far off the wall. That he just isn't able to recover. So it looks like maybe this first hold is a little hard to grab. One it's kind of awkward because it's enclosed so you have to grab it pretty specifically. And two, his starting position is kind of unique. He's got both his hands close together on this pinch and this crimp. So he's going to have to be really actively engaged. This is going to be a route that's going to be really important to drive through the feet on but also get into a good position so you can really load up onto this hold. From the looks of it, it looks like he has to match in it. So one, being accurate enough to hit the hold, but two, being accurate and having enough forethought to hit it in a way that you can match it is going to be very important. And so he's able to kind of get this pretty scrunched high foot, uh, hand foot match here. So he loads that up. Um, and now, you know, he's kind of opposite pose because he's left hand right foot. Uh, but as he attempts to match it, you'll see that he's having a hard time getting that right hand in. Um, and the moment he does he's going to kind of utilize the technique maybe like a backflip to balance out. Um, in fact as he's kind of switching this, um, this would probably be the time to kind of tension up so lightly holding it as he is kind of sink into that position and then try to match. Um, because right now you'll see he wrestles with it as he was wrestling with it. He kind of pumps himself in and out And uh, that's just going to cost some energy", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She sort of just relatively slowly gets into the shape which means she has to drop it and in this case she doesn't even have, she doesn't even fully make the shape. You can see that this line looks good but then she breaks the line here because of this bent knee and also this flexed foot and so it's not a line anymore. Also this arm, last time the chest, the hand was right on the chest which looked very strong and clear. She still has a good deep plie here so this side of her body is executing it well but the other parts of her body are not hitting the shape but she's in general not hitting the shape in time at all with any part of her body so she has to drop it before it's even created so it doesn't read as a shape, it doesn't look very clear, it doesn't look very strong or polished. Here she's quite stiff again. She's doing this isolation through the rib cage while moving the arm sort of in the opposite direction of the ribs. She's really stiff through her spine and so this just looks pretty awkward. One thing you know that could help even if she's not able to increase the articulation through the spine, one thing she could do is think about moving her pelvis in the opposite direction as the rib cage because that would make this motion look looser and stronger. So she does a really good job with this turn. So what she's doing is she's turning, she's sort of jump turning on her left leg while swinging the right leg out and up and she does a good job of keeping this knee pretty straight and making it arc with the leg. So this is a good moment for her. Another thing about this step, again, she's very stiff through her spine, her shoulders, even her cervical spine. And with this step, because of that stiffness, she's not able to isolate the hips very well. And so the step is having a feel of front and back that matches the footwork, and that makes it less interesting to watch because there's no polyrhythm in the body. This step would be much more interesting if the hips were going side to side in a smooth way while the leg was going front and back, and I believe that's what's intended with this step. But she's not really able to isolate very well here, so instead she's just pitching her, she's bending at the hips and pitching her torso front and back, which makes it look stiff and awkward. Again, really weak through the arms, both arms here. So here she's doing a basic step back and forth right now she's moving towards her right or stage right and she's brought this arm up just very slightly it's pretty graceful but it's very non-specific it's very vague not a super clear shape it's a little coming up a little bit behind the music so it just again is not crisp enough to really add any interest to what she's doing here. I would like to see her attack this more bring the arm all the way up to the shoulder quicker and then maybe across her body I'd like to see more energy out of her arms here it's just kind of very weak like physically weak this this elbow slightly bent there's not a lot of energy coming out the fingertips this arm is quite tense as it has been for the majority of the piece so far tense through here through the shoulder tense through the elbow tense through the wrist and so that tension conveys a lack of confidence and also just doesn't quite fit with this with this choreography so what I'm wanting is strength through both arms and clarity rather than tension or weakness Again, same as before, she's just doing a basic step forward and back. And frankly, it's a little bit boring to watch because there's not a lot of interest happening. The step is repeated over and over again. The footwork is very simplistic, not simplistic, simple, basic. The arms are just kind of doing this front and back thing. And also on top of that, there's not a lot of personality shining through her facial expressions. So again, especially when something is repeated over and over again, or when a step is very basic, it's really important to make it interesting in some kind of a way. So I'd encourage her to find a way to do that. However, I will say she's doing the basic step pretty much correctly on the music. The only thing is that she's lacking the movement through the hips that Salsa is pretty much known for. And that's because in general, she's got a bit of a stiffness, especially through the spine. Here she's made a good shape, but my issue is that again she didn't attack it very well. She got into the shape just a little bit too slowly so that she doesn't have enough time musically to hold it for very long, so it doesn't read very well as a shape. It reads as a throwaway movement, which is very unfortunate because she's doing a great job with the line from the right fingers to the left toes. This looks really nice. She's in a really good deep plie. It looks very clear in this freeze frame, but again because she doesn't attack it quickly enough and strongly enough, she has to drop it very quickly in order to stay on the beat with the music, and so it doesn't read very well as a shape. Again, very weak through the arms here. It sort of in this moment looks like a strong shape, but it's not coming across as strong because what she's doing is she's bringing it up way too slowly relative to the music and relative to the footwork. The footwork is pretty good here. She's putting her weight on one foot, touching the other toe forward, and she's on the music there. The touch forward has a staccato feel to it, but the arm is not matching that, and the arm really appears to the intention is for it to be in this cross counterbalance with the leg, and she's not achieving that because she's bringing the arm up too slowly. So even if this was the intended shape, which it might be, she's bringing it up so slowly that it looks unintended. It looks weak. Unfortunately again she's losing the shape that she made with her arms in the turn. She sort of just drops the arms, they're not super specific, again tension through this elbow. So unfortunately even though her turn was successful she didn't recover very well from it, she dropped the shape. So I would encourage her because the step, the recovery step with the feet is very basic, again maybe find a way to add some interest with the arms. One thing she could do is keep them up for longer and then as she's doing this basic step to recover from the turn bring them down slowly. This is good dynamics here. So she's doing a basic salsa step, but adding this bigger step out with a drag. And this is the second time she's done it and she's doing it really well in terms of dynamics. So here she's stepping onto her right foot and sort of dragging the left foot slightly behind or to her side. And it's nice because she's doing the drag motion with a sort of legato feel, which is really nice because it helps to extend out the music there, but is still on the tempo and on the beat. Again, I'd love to see something of interest happening with the arms. This is a really unique moment in this piece because there's no other step, excuse me, so far in the choreography where the leg comes out and up, especially with this turn. So it could be a really interesting, big dynamic moment. And it is with her with the lower half. But again, the arms are non-specific. This arm is sort of just hanging there with some tension through the wrist. This arm is not in this non-specific shape here. There's not a lot of energy at the fingertips. The gaze is just kind of, I don't know, just there's nothing interesting happening with the upper body is what I'm saying. And so it detracts from the good technique that she established with the leg. So I would encourage her to talk with the choreographer. Was there something else I'm supposed to do with the arms that's more specific? And if not, if I can just do whatever I want, let me do something. Let me make it interesting. Let me add the icing on the cake to the choreography. Again, lack of clarity and strength with the arms here. She's beginning a little bit of a turn, looks like she's prepping for a turn, but the arms are sort of just reacting to that, especially this arm, this right arm. The left arm is still quite tense with the elbow sort of glued back to her body. So again, just finding ways to be very clear about her shapes and be strong but not tense. Really great turn. So the reason that this turn is successful is because she sets herself up with a preparation by pushing through the ball of the left foot and then transferring the weight to the right foot at the appropriate moment while keeping the hips parallel with each other. Her arms were pretty good too. She brought them down and up in a nice arc and has kept them in this shape throughout the turn. She did a good job here turning her facing, so she was going sort of back and forth here, facing downstage, and she's just turned her body to face stage left, and she did that very smoothly, very nicely, by rotating on the ball of this foot and lifting this foot off the floor just very slightly, so that made that change of facing look very smooth. Again, the arms are lacking interest, they're lacking consistency, they're lacking clarity, and they're lacking strength. So she's doing a good job with the footwork here. She's staying on the music. The upper body is just a little bit uninteresting. She's not really doing much with the arms and it makes, it's even less interesting because she's just repeating the same step over and over again. So it's really not really, she's really not grabbing the viewer's attention in any way. And she's also quite stiff through her arms here and her hands, like this hand is in a fist, so she's got some tension through her hand there. She's got tension through this shoulder and this elbow and making this sort of awkward shape here. So I just encourage her to find ways to be really clear about her shapes and maybe add a little bit of interest with a facial expression or a shimmy or something else with the arms in the upper body, especially when a step is either simplistic, like this one is, and or when it's repeated multiple times.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They incorporate this nice soft shimmy of the shoulders, which while it's adding a bit more of a staccato presence than we've seen thus far, is really welcome in this kind of flowy movement dynamic that this dancer has. They're also continuing to incorporate their arms in ways that are appropriate as well as exciting and appropriate for the movement vocabulary, and maintaining that nice range of motion in the pelvis down through the soft bent knees and consistent footwork. As the dancer begins with a basic stationary salsa step, they right off the bat demonstrate that they have a more advanced understanding of the movement vocabulary and technique here. They're able to stay consistent with their footwork, which is connecting them to the rhythm of the music. They have a nice consistent bend in their knee, though they would benefit from dropping their pelvis back to be a bit more grounded in this movement. However, they have a nice range of motion activation happening in the pelvis and up through the upper body. The rhythms are incorporated choreographically in a way that's appropriate, makes sense, and is clear. As the dancer performs this series of turns, she's able to do so fairly quickly and efficiently by continuing to incorporate the spotting of her head as she's performing these turns. She's also got really strongly shaped arms, even down through the hands, which you can see over here, which is helping her to move quickly and efficiently and grounding her in some stability. She would benefit from having a bit more of a bend in her knees and dropping up the pelvis to be more grounded as she performs these turns, but overall she's able to do so quickly and efficiently in a way that does not disconnect her from the music. As the dancer transitions into a cross step, they're a little bit delayed getting into this cross step. They appear to struggle maybe a bit slightly with the transition. However, they make up for it by getting connected to the rhythm a bit more deeply, fairly quickly. She continues to maintain some nice consistency in the incorporation of her arms and her pelvis, while maintaining a nice soft bend in her knees, which allows her to move the feet quickly and efficiently, which is also helping to connect her to the rhythm of the music.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She first planted the right foot excuse me, she first planted her left foot and then she took her right foot and swung it around to square herself up. And as you can see her hand is directly underneath the ball so she's going to shoot the ball and is going to create backspin and there is going to be no sidespin because of the release from where she released the ball she would need to put the ball outside of the square with some sidespin for it to go into the basket. Since she's not using sidespin she needs to come over more to give herself a better angle to hit the top right portion of the square because as she releases she gets over more to the right as she releases the ball it will have a you have a clearer path for the ball to hit the top right corner of the square. However since she didn't get far enough over to the right side of the basket and where she released it she's still sort of underneath the basket so as she goes up to shoot it it's going to hit the bottom of the rim. So when we're underneath the rim like this we have to create sidespin on the ball and hit the ball outside of the square and let the sidespin take the ball into the basket. If we're no longer underneath the basket and we get far enough over to the right side of the basket we don't need any sidespin and we can just place the ball nicely in the top right corner of the square and we'll go into the basket. As she didn't get far enough over because she's using a backspin on this shot and not using any sidespin the shot went straight hit the bottom of the rim and came off. She does a good job of releasing the ball nice and high with her arm extended fully towards the basket. You see here she does a good job of letting the ball roll off her fingertips and she also has her left hand up which will allow her to protect the ball if a defender tries to come from her left side and contest the shot. They will have to run, they have to get through that left arm and while she makes contact with the defender with her left arm it will slow the defense down just enough to allow her to release the ball out of her fingertips before the defense has an opportunity to block the shot. Here you see she uses the correct footwork for jumping off of her left foot when doing a right hand reverse layup. So she properly jumps off of that left foot. You see here her right knee as she's getting ready to jump off of the ground is low. Ideally once we're in this position the right knee should be up higher towards her waist area so we lift that knee up to really help us to explode and reach the highest point of our jump. where she's releasing the ball from, she starts here in this area and then she comes across directly and then shoots the ball here with her right hand. From this position she's more in the front of the rim and not on the right side of the rim. So from this position, as she starts here instead of going directly across this way as we come to the reverse layup, we start here, we want to come at an angle here and get to the right side and release the ball from this area here for the reverse layup. As she released it more from the front of the rim and you can also see from this view here, she's more in front of the line, in front of the rim and also too you can see she's outside. If I just draw a straight line down, she's outside of that line. When we do a reverse layup, we want to be have our body on this line in some form or fashion. She's far, if we're completely outside of this line that means that we're outside of this line and we are, as you can see, we split by split, draw a middle a line down the middle portion of the square. Then I draw this line straight down. You can see she's in the middle of the floor and outside that line. If we're going to be outside this line, we have to be more to the side here and more for this angle. So if I release the ball from this angle here, I have a good angle for the ball to go off the backboard. But the position that she's in is just going to hit the backboard and come directly back to her unless you put side spin on the ball. Without the use of side spin, the only place that we can hit the backboard and the ball go into the basket from this portion of the floor is if we hit the ball in the middle portion of the top of the square. We don't need any side spin, the backspin we hit the backboard and go directly in. But shooting it from this portion of the floor without the use of side spin and using backspin, we hit the backboard and it's just going to come right back to us without going into the basket. We see here she places the ball on the backboard outside of the square on the backboard. She has really nice height as it's above that line on the square, but since it's so far to the right of the square, as it hits the backboard here, we need to put side spin on the ball so when it hits the backboard it will spin directly into the basket. However as she released it, she didn't put side spin on the ball, she put back spin. And so since it hit this portion of the backboard with back spin, it just hit the backboard and it came back directly straight back to the shooter.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So they eventually do the move and they do it relatively smoothly. They just wasted a lot of energy kind of hyping it up before trying. See how we see, they're moving smoother here. They're not as dynamic, but they still use quite a bit of momentum and speed as they transition between holds. So good sequencing with the climbers. They start through this as the judges highlighting the holes using a laser pointer. The climber is moving along with them and kind of pantomiming their expected positions as they go. So actually quite a bit of hesitation and kind of lack of awareness of positioning for this move, the way they keep readjusting their hands and feet. They look like they almost wanted to step the foot up for a moment and opted not to. In any scenario, the next hole they're going for is large and this is where they should use more dynamic movement. They should just jump through. So climber pulls on and they're moving very dynamically. They're kind of jumping and bouncing in between these positions. And because the holds are so positive, they can do this and it still isn't too difficult. However, it's less efficient on a climb this easy to throw that much energy and momentum into each move. Even if they're able to climb it relatively smoothly, it's more fatiguing for the session overall. And if they're going to compete on multiple climbs, goal should be to climb efficiently and save energy.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Everything in this place, even in this compact area, he still knows where everything is and he's not searching for whatever item that he's looking for, which is crucial to the execution and the timing of any given dish.

And you can see that the eggs started cooking pretty much right away. They're already opaque around the edges. I'm still dark yellow in the middle though So they're probably just about now developing a skin underneath the whole way through And he's wrapping the tomatoes back up to put them all back in the fridge. MBC \ub274\uc2a4 \uae40\uc7ac\uacbd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. Now the cook has picked up a bowl of eggs and he's adding the eggs to the pan. I would have expected him to cook the vegetables first just because the vegetables are going to take longer and the eggs are the work of a minute if that. So this way he's going to end up probably with cold eggs or overcooked eggs while he's cooking his vegetables. So worth saying, it's usually better to use a serrated knife for tomatoes, but his knife looks like it's nice and sharp So no safety concerns there The cook is now using the spatula to break the eggs up in the pan. The cook is still moving the eggs around the pan with the chopsticks. They're starting to break up a little. If he's going for scrambled, that's fine. And he's cracking a second egg into the bowl. The cook has set the eggs down and now he's turned to a saute pan he has on the stove. So it looks like maybe his goal was to just kind of steam or boil instead of saute. He's taking away some of his flavor by doing it this way though. He's now picking up the onions and adding them to the pan. Um, might have been a good idea to add more oil, but it is a nonstick pan, so he'll be okay. He's rinsing out his bowl right away, which is great. If it dries, then the egg residue is harder to get off. and I think a can of tomatoes as well. And here's pressing the tomatoes down again with a spatula. So the cook has gathered his garlic cloves and he's starting to chop them. He has a hand, his non-cutting hand, on the end of his knife which is perfect form for controlling it well and also will enable him to chop more quickly. And here the cook is smashing his cloves of garlic. This is a great way to get the skin off and also makes them easier to chop. And here the cook has picked up a head of garlic and he's peeling a couple of cloves or pulling a couple of cloves off the head. See here the cook has pulled a light colored oil, probably vegetable or canola. So here the cook has pulled over a small bowl of grape tomatoes and he's cutting those in half. And here he's rinsing his hands off. and he left the heat on and set the saute pan back down to the heat. That looks like a good amount of salt and the tomatoes and onions should be nicely seasoned. I'm at a high heat though. That shouldn't be necessary. I think it's better to just let the tomato soften. You just remove the lid and set that aside. I'm just putting the cap back on the oil and setting it aside. And here the eggs are completely done cooking and you can see he's starting he's preparing to take them off the heat And he's using his chopsticks to beat the eggs. Now the cook has picked up the canned tomatoes and he's adding some of that to the pan as well. Now he's picked up a bowl and he's setting that down to receive the eggs when they're finished. He might be just trying to express the liquid a little faster so it'll evaporate more quickly. And he's turned off the heat and he's transferring the eggs and tomatoes back into the bowl. It looks like tomato sauce. He's using the spatula to press down the tomatoes in the pan. I'm not really sure why. Here the cook is pressing the tomatoes down with the spatula again. Again, I'm not really sure what the purpose is here. And he's pulled out a pair of chopsticks. And he's turning on his fan. It looks like some of the liquid is starting to evaporate and it's thickening up a bit, but it's still pretty watery. Looks like he's having a little trouble peeling them. Maybe he could have smashed them a little more, but also sometimes you just have garlic that has the skin sticking to it. And he's broken the eggs up and he's moving them around to mix them with the tomatoes and onions. Now he's grinding fresh pepper over the tomatoes as well. And he's rinsing his fingers off from the egg residue. Here the cook is still mixing everything and moving it around the pan. And the cook has picked up the saute pan and he's moving it around to make the oil slide around to coat the pan. And here the cook is adding oil to the pan. It's a little early, he should let the pan heat up first. And now the cook is moving the eggs around the pan and you can see that they did in fact make a skin all the way across. So really he could turn his pan off at this point and just move them around the pan until they're finished cooking. Now he's back to the pan, he's stirring the tomatoes and onions with a spatula. Just by the look of it, his tomatoes and onions really aren't starting to cook yet and he still has quite a bit of liquid in the pan. So not really the texture you want yet. Here the cook has picked up his knife and a green onion and he's cutting the end off. And now he's cracking the egg over the bowl. You hear the cook is pulling out an egg. He's also adding the tomatoes at the same time, however, so he's going to have a hard time saut\u00e9ing. He's at this point effectively steaming them because the tomatoes are going to let out a lot of liquid. Would have been great if he had lit the burner ahead of time. That way he could have had it heating up while he cut his vegetables, but that's just for efficiency's sake, not necessarily going to affect anything in the cooking process. And he just turned his fan off. And now the cook is peeling the cloves, which again should be made easier by the fact that he just smashed them. Here the cook is grinding some salt into his eggs. And he's just picked up a spatula. He's pulling plastic off of his canned tomatoes. The cook has removed the spatula and set it aside, and now he's about to grind some salt over the tomatoes. But he's now adding water to the saute pan from a kettle. and he's depositing the skins in his compost bag. And he's moved the pan over to I think his bigger burner and he's lighting it now. So now he's added the tomatoes to the pan and you can hear the sizzle there. The pan is still nice and hot. He's now adding his cooked eggs back into the pan with the tomatoes and onions. I don't really understand the process here. It's possible that this is just a dish that's over my head, but the eggs are already cooked so adding them back in at this point is just going to leave him with overcooked eggs. With all that water, it's probably going to be a watery dish overall. And here he's slicing the green onion on his cutting board. He's got a really good grip on his knife. Here the cook is moving the oil around the pan again. Better to just let the pan heat up first and then he can move the oil around right before he adds everything.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It's a little bit light and we can't quite make it out, so you can still stay within this mezzo piano dynamic and give us a little bit more volume so we can really hear that melody. This is great tone that he's getting out of the guitar. We just need a little bit more volume here. It's a little bit too soft, especially for solo playing. Don't be afraid to play it more of a mezzo forte. Good tone, just need more volume. We heard a bit of a popping sound on the note just played with the fourth finger. This is because there is not the correct finger placement, a little bit too close to the fret bar, but additionally too much of an outward motion with the pick plucking that string, so it snapped back into the fret board a little bit. We just want to avoid that, make sure that all of our picking motions are straight across so that the string does not move back into the fret board. This is just a note that this guitarist is doing the correct thing of using an amp when playing electric guitar. We always want to use an amp and because he's using an amp we're really going to get the true sound of the guitar. So that's a correct move. The guitarist is doing a good job of bringing out volume wise this melody that's being played on the B string is Using a little bit bigger and harder of a picking motion on those strings and lighter motion on the chords So it's allowing us to hear the chords as accompaniment and a melody on top. So that's well done We don't have enough of a pulse here. It's not because of any technical reason, just a musical decision the guitarist is making. We just need to have more of a pulse here, something to give us an idea of the flow and the larger structure of the rhythm. This is a great example if we look here visually of finger independence in a balanced hand. All four fingers have to be in a different place on the guitar. It could be an awkward move, but because his fingers have good independence and the hand is balanced, he's able to easily hit these notes. We notice that as he shifted to this chord, he allowed his thumb to drop further down on the underside of the neck, which is the right move because then we can rotate our hand over the guitar more easily. So that's well done. We notice right here we're not getting a good sound out of the note being played with the first finger on the left hand. And that's because instead of actually picking up his finger and moving it to that fret and back, he just rotated it. So he actually didn't even get the underside, the tip of his finger onto that note. He just rolled the side of his finger onto it. And that's not gonna give us good tone. So even if it's a small shift or a small movement, we still have to do the full movement to get to the correct place so that we can get the best sound out of the guitar. I heard a little bit of a buzz here and we can see that this first string in the left hand is not right on the fret. We just need to make sure that the hand shape doesn't get too condensed. We can see the fingers are getting pretty close to each other here. Make sure that we have the proper spacing so that we're landing in the correct place on the fret so that the string can fully vibrate. That was a good job bringing out the higher note of that chord in one strum. He was able to have two different dynamics and a slight crescendo to that top note in the strum because that's the melody. That's a really tasteful move and well executed. It's a really great light touch that the guitarist is getting here. We're not hearing any kind of twang or overplaying of the strings. It's really well done. We have a complete loss of pulse here. It's not clear where the beat is and what the tempo is, so we need to do something here, preferably bring out these strong beats a little bit and keep the melody that he's playing in between these chords more rhythmically stable so we can pick up on some kind of a pulse. We could use a little bit more volume on this chord here. And in general, maybe a bit of a crescendo to this chord. We're lacking some musical direction. So this chord, which has a lot of suspense to it, bring it out, crescendo to it, because that'll build the suspense up for our ear, and then we can relax later on a cadence. But we need to bring this out more, just to keep it interesting. We're hearing a little bit of extraneous noise and a little bit of muting. As we can see, these fingers are getting pretty cramped down here. They're not really directly in the middle of the fret, so that low E string is not being held down all the way, which is contributing to that muting sound that we're hearing. We're missing a little bit of the higher voices in these last chords. As we can see, he's intending to play the higher voices, as we can see, by the fourth finger on the B string here, but the strum was not long enough. It did not hit all six strings, so he missed out on some of the harmony. So just make sure that even if it's light, we're still hitting all six strings. This is an excellent left hand position for classical guitar or electric guitar really, but we can see a nice relaxed thumb We see that all four fingers are perpendicular to the string so that looks especially from this angle We can see how these fingers are balanced perpendicular to the string. It's excellent", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Just kind of gets it in his right hand. The feet are standing still. Very little lift in elevation, explosiveness. And you know, overall, this is just really not game speed and game like. He just would really, the recommendation is you break everything down before you try to do this drill. Basic fundamentals in terms of shot, execution, and then footwork. Again, standing flat-footed, little knee bend here, and he's just kind of hoisting the ball up, if you will. Let's get this guide hand on the ball. Let's get a better angle over. We need to be over here, not under the basket. So the spacing is really off to be, you know, in terms of execution. Here, again, standing under the net, just kind of flips the ball over to his left palm. Again, very little control. I mean, you don't have any control. The ball's just sitting there, and you're just using that motion of lifting it instead of getting your shooting hand behind the ball to shoot it. Again, standing under the basket, see how far under he is? I mean, he's practically under the backboard. It's going to be really tough to finish this shot. Again, he shoots it totally just that he really relies on that right arm and shoulder to do all the work. Here's the shot, he's standing right underneath the basket, and he's just hooking it. The ball is sitting on the palm of his left hand, here's his other hand, you know, ideally we love it on the ball as you bring the shot up, but he's just in a very vulnerable position here with losing the ball and turning it over. I do like that he's looking up, he's not looking at the ball, he's looking at the target. You can see it right here. He is bending his knees, that's good, but just very little control. He's just kind of lifting and flicking it up there. I would really work on the footwork first and then work on some form shooting on the right side and then using the left hand on the left side. And then do this drill. Here again, just standing under the net, I see a little bit of kind of pushing off the balls of the feet. Again, the ball's sitting on the right palm. It's not, there's not a lot of control or stability here. And when you, that ball jiggles in that hand, is it, without it being stable on its way up, it's gonna lose control. There he lifts it. He does, you know, extend that left arm, but as it goes up, he has a little control of it, so you can kind of see it going off to the left here. Here the shooter is doing the Mike and drill. He's choosing to kind of just stand in the middle of the rim and is just kind of hooking the shot up with his right hand. You can see, he kind of used this motion. He is trying to use the backboard and he is using the correct hand on the right side. But he's standing underneath the basket. There's very lift and elevation and movement on his part. He loves to stand under the net. Again, this drill is performed a lot better as you move from side to side and you get that shooting hand behind the ball and have that angle to use the top of the square. Here, he's really relying on one hand to do a lot of the work. Here, see how he brings it up here like a hook shot. The guide hand is down. Very little lift and elevation. And look how far this ball's got to travel. And probably when it left his hand, it just kind of lost control. Here, you know, little footwork here, he's just kind of standing with his body face in the basket and he's practically under the net. So the only thing he's got here is to hook it up here with his left hand. And you can see his arm, the right arm comes off. So there's no real control with the ball just sitting in the palm of your left hand. But here, you know, he hooks it, has little control of where the ball's going to go, so it hits the rim and pops back out. But look where he's standing. He's not, he doesn't really have the angle to use that square because his body is just staying still underneath the basket. And very little lift here, and power. Here he just gets the rebound and he didn't actually didn't even move his feet. He's standing flat-footed on two feet and you could see him bring the ball down really low. I mean this is what he's seeing. He's not really moving from side to side. Plus he's bringing the ball down really low and he's starting his shot really down in the here low. You want to keep it high because there's defenders down here. So ideally is I would recommend him you know working on footwork without the ball. Just working someone show him the correct footwork. We want the one foot takeoff lift the opposite knee and the movement and what it feels like to move from side to side. Pushing off, lifting, etc.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So at first they kind of sink down into the start position with this left arm crossed over, but because this hand is going to be the one taking off, the climber just needs to switch up their cross. And so it's a good example of the way you start is really indicative of the way the boulder ends up going, and you can see that here that you do not want the left hand over the right hand, you want the right hand over the left hand for this specific situation. So here the climber is able to get into this hold. I don't know if it was a legal start. It seems like they pulled on to the wall super fast, maybe didn't gain control.

So when he actually hits it, he's still just way too low. He's not going to hold that swing out. He needs to aim high enough to try to get both hands on as quickly as possible. And also have some ability to pull up and power into the move. So he just needs to, you know, his position looks good. His movement looks good. He just needs to pull more up and push harder.

A lot of younger musicians tend to slide their finger around to find the pitch as opposed to replacing it. A replacing strategy ensures that the placement of the finger is practiced, not the pitch of the note that is practiced. And so this is a high quality technique of practice. A recommendation for this type of practice, even though it stayed slow and they're changing between all of the arpeggios, is actually trying to do the arpeggios a little faster now that they have the hand frame. I would do that in sections, first octave, second octave, third octave, and seeing if they can improve the speed at which they can achieve this intonation. Just before they play a third finger on the way down, that first finger tends to pop out like this. This is indicative of some excess tension when they reach for that first finger. I would advise practicing keeping that finger down while playing that third finger. Musician also looks really good. Not the best seating option for taller individuals but you can see that this person is on the shorter side is lifting their their feet here. Close to the front of the chair, nice and tall spine. Instrument looks like it's coming out of their person at a good spot. They chose to go higher and restart the whole thing over, but the coming down part of this range needed some individual practice. I would start where she currently is and then come down again rather than finish going up, just to isolate that one spot that was not comfortable the last time she played that. This is a really good practice technique for arpeggios, making sure that the hand frame is really solid and that the finger spacing from one string to the other makes an in-tune double stop is quintessential professional technical warm-up here. This is a really good exercise. The musician tends to use a varied amount of bow for each pattern. I'm pretty sure each of these patterns have been the same quantity of notes per bow, but they sometimes get to the frog, sometimes they don't quite get to the tip, sometimes they're only playing within this range here. I would advise the student to do a stopped staccato stroke for each down bow and measure every single note that they need to play in that scale to make sure that they're using all of the bow exactly the same way every time. If they want to use a different type of bow or length of bow for this pattern, it should be consistent throughout. Good fingering. A slight intonation issue on the first shift of past fourth position. Intonation kind of all over the place on this one. I can tell that the student is getting tired of doing these exercises and losing focus on them. I would advise a student be done with this exercise at this point. And you can see how the first finger doesn't pop up when they're going up for the third finger, but it does when they're coming back down for the third finger. That's just excess tension. That could be eliminated. A really nice motion of the elbow underneath the instrument when traveling over to the upper strings But then it pulls itself back over more when they're starting to shift up into the higher positions. Really good technique Really great bow hold. You can see the beautifully curved wrist here with the first finger over the stick, pinkies on top with a nice tilt. You can even see the frog right here peeking out because the tilt of the bow is toward the fingerboard.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It's an, instead of using the inside of the foot to pass, he's using the outside of that foot. And this is the stance you would have. You would have that toe pointed down. That heel is going to be higher than the toe. The knee is trying to get over the ball at the point of contact as it comes in. It's slightly over the ball. He's got a slight forward bend, head down, tracking with his eyes. That's good. Soft knee. So like all those things look good. And he's, he's contacting the ball ahead of his body, which is what we would want to, what we would want to do if he's using this specific technique. So overall a nice looking picture here. So after he makes this return pass, he passes here, goes back to here, then he needs to get to a space where he can then make the next action. So we would be asking a player to side shuffle or move really quick in a lateral direction. So what he's doing is that he's staying very tight to the cone, making a return pass, and then taking one step basically in this direction, and it's a very slow pace. So as you can see, the server is ready to make the return pass, and he's not yet in a position with his feet where he's set, and then he can then make adjustments based on the pass, the speed of the pass or the quality of the pass. So my recommendation for him is that he move much quicker with his feet to get to that position and get in a ready stance. One thing that he consistently does on this side is he does not use that left foot. He'll pivot this way with his body to open up and pass the ball with his right foot back to the server. And we should be like thinking about this as this side you train right foot, this side you train left foot if he's going to be moving back and forth between the two. So that's why I want a recommendation that he try to consistently do that he can train a skill with repetition. There's nothing wrong with the technique that he's using per se and he's opening his body enough but it is a little bit awkward. Like you see where that ball's coming. So instead of his leg being straight down and this L shape he's having to bend that knee more flexion to then get the ball or to get his foot to there to then pass through the ball. So that would be the correction I would make is that he used his left foot on this side. You know, this is what can happen when you touch this ball across your body, but you use too large of a touch. And because he's not moving his body at the same time as he's sweeping the ball across, he relies solely on the touch and the quality of the touch. And if it's supposed to get to here, but he's putting it here, then now he has to move much faster to catch up to this ball, which is what you can see what's happening here is that he's having to reach and overextend with that body and really catch up to it. And that's going to cause issues with the return pass being accurate, being firm, being right back to where he needs to get it to. So, you know, he's having some variation in terms of one touch and then, or receiving then passing across of his body. It's just a matter of preparedness and controlling the quality of that touch. But I would recommend that anytime he takes a touch across his body to here, to then pass that he should be moving his body at the same time that he's in a good position for the return. Yeah, what we saw is just that same foot toe was down and the heel was higher as he made that contact to pass through the ball. And this is a slow pass back to the target and it's off target now. It's going to the side of him as opposed to going directly back to where he wants it to go. Um, that like you see the pointer toe going this direction here, the way in which he hit it was a soft surface because that toes pointed down on that ankles not locked. And so it's just causing the ball to go off to the side here. Now when he goes back the other way here, the ball is being played in and he needs to push the ball with the outside of his foot. What I don't like about the picture, number one, is there's no adjustment with his body position as that ball is being played in. So what I mean by that is he's having to reach across the center line of his body with his right foot, which will put him immediately in a position where he's off balance. He won't be in balance and able to push off this foot in this direction effectively. So to fix that, what he would need to do is he would need to get this left foot planted more out here. So that way he can then sweep that right foot across as he makes contact with the ball and push the ball in that direction and at the same time push off this foot in that direction so that his whole body is moving with it at the same time. And then he'll have to, obviously that'll incorporate him lowering his hips, getting his body lower to the ground so that he can load into that plant leg and push off. So with the touch and as that ball comes in over here and he takes a touch with the, in this case, the outside of his foot to get the ball here, he should be aiming for a target, number one, of this area so that he can move to get a clear line of sight back to the target. And then the second thing is he wants that touch if he takes it here to be moving more in like a diagonally forward direction, not a diagonally backward direction, because that will cause him to have to really severely readjust behind the ball. So that was number one. So I think one is get that ball out to here to make sure that ball is moving diagonally forward. That will help with the quality of the return pass and then he can get prepared for the next action. You know, one thing he's not doing very well is when this ball comes in, it's a poor pass. It's played directly in front or to his left side as opposed to being out here, which should be a right-footed pass. So he needs to be good at making like quick adjustments with his feet. But because he's flat-footed, he's making these very slow adjustments. And here, like as the ball's already getting there, he's not in a great position. Like his hips not even all the way open to a point where he can hit the ball back with having some back lift in the leg and then coming through to hit back to the target. So he needs to move much quicker with his footwork to correct for a poor pass from the server. So leading back to his beginning stance of how he's preparing himself when the ball's played to him, he needs to be on the balls of his feet. He needs to be much more ready to react. So now the subject is moved into a one-touch passing sequence where he's gonna play in single touch back from The server and he's gonna move to the next side to receive the next pass One thing I see with this technique almost right away I like that this plant foot is getting next to where that ball is gonna end up So he's in good balance there and that foot is pointing towards his intended target which helps align his hips He's got a slight lean back like it would be better if he was leaning a little bit more over the ball That would be a little bit better here And then with that with the kicking foot you can see that the angle of his foot is down with the toe We prefer to try to get that toe up a little bit more even or even a little bit higher than the heel and then Contacting the ball at the center line of the ball if he hits it with this toe down There's a there's an increased chance that either goes off the heel in that direction Or it could be a weak pass back that could go off this way if it hits off like closer towards the toe box Thanks for watching! Yeah, so we talked about this a little bit already when his foot's in this position with the toe down and the heel up, it, it creates an issue where there's a potential for the ball to go more off the heel than the center of the foot. And what that does then is that pushes the ball this direction. So right away, what we need to do is we need to get at the opposite, try to over exaggerate that by putting toe up, heel down. If it ends up being more in line with each other, that's fine. But as long as that he's creating a flat, firm surface to then kick the ball back to his partner, that's what we want to improve. Again, this is another thing that he does continuously as he tries to like walk this direction to get ready as this ball is hitting poorly across him. He has these really slow actions of opening up and correcting for these things. They should, they could fix this by making it mandatory that this player take a controlling touch and wait for this player to get to a ready position. And then this player calls for the ball and initiates the sequence to start. Right now what's occurring is that this player, the server, is hitting the ball whenever he feels ready and is miss hitting the ball often. And then this player is never in the correct position with his feet ready to receive that pass. So that's the, that would be what I would do to fix this and make that mandatory. You know, one thing the player does a lot of times is he's contacting that ball out in front of his body, which is putting him in a backwards lean because he has to reach out in front of his body. So that makes sense mechanically why that's working. If he would just try to get this ball contacted a little bit closer to underneath his body or just slightly in front of his body as opposed to where he is, then that would help him maintain a forward lean and be more balanced as he strikes the ball. On the next rep, you can see right away, very upright in his stance on the heels of both of his feet, very upright in that stance. So as he pivots to open up with the inside of his foot and push the ball this direction, he's getting almost no force from this foot pushing off in that direction. His body's not moving in that direction, and therefore he's relying solely on the touch to push the ball this way. And that could cause errors if he hits it too hard, if he hits it too soft. So we want to eliminate that. Again, it's going to be get yourself in a good body position on the balls of both your feet. Prepare, to hit, prepare once that ball's played in that you start moving and pushing off in this direction as he makes contact with the ball. That way he can then move to get around it as that ball arrives here, and then he can make the pass back. That would be the difference, but it starts with the basics from the very beginning. This is a better foot position that you can see as he gets that back swing going, the back lift, and then he's going to swing through the ball as he goes. You can see that he's really clearly locked that ankle to open up and create that flat surface like L-shape with his ankle and his foot. That'll create a much firmer surface for him. The only thing again that I would make the correction on is this plant foot is always really facing this way because it's a close distance. There's really no, it won't really affect this because it's such a short distance of return pass, but if it were a larger distance pass, there's just more opportunity for that ball to then kind of pop out this way because naturally his hips want to kind of follow that direction. So it's a small correction but could make a big difference in the quality of the return pass. To start this activity, well first is that the labeled activity is dribbling and this is a passing exercise going back and forth between two players here so that's that label of the activities incorrect. One thing that we're seeing right away is that he's doing a two-touch sequence where he's going to bring the ball back across this way and then pass the ball back to this player so that's one thing just a difference that we're going to evaluate that almost immediately based on what he's doing. So very consistent with him is that he's in this, this toe down, heel up type situation. And he's contacting the ball actually slightly in front of his body. What I would recommend is that he get that plan foot next to the ball. So he times it a little bit better. So that ball's arriving more here. And then that plan foot, you can see the direction that it's facing. It's facing this way. Get that plan foot to face towards here. That's the target. So that'll help align the hips correctly. And then contact that ball a little bit more closer to here. Get that toe up, heel down, as opposed to that. And that will create a firmer surface with a locked ankle. And he'll be able to follow through and give more direction towards the target. And this is the exact opposite of what we just talked about. What we wouldn't want to do is that he doesn't make any adjustment when the ball was played over here. There's no adjustment to get his left foot over here so that he could use that same outside of the foot technique. What he's doing is reaching far across his body, overextending with that side, which puts him immediately in a backwards lean. And then now that strike back to his partner is going to be a much weaker, weaker pass and have less direction on it. The correction again, he has to move this plant foot. He's got to get this over here to put himself in a better position to use this technique. Yeah, this was a nice touch here. Again, it was the inside of the foot. He's got a good surface. That ball's moving diagonally up and now it puts him in a position where he can pass the ball or it gets into like a normal passing position inside of the foot technique. So just pointing out like that contact that he's making with his right foot across his body by bringing it and meeting that ball at the halfway point is giving him a good angle and it's at the right speed because he contacted this ball here and you see where the ball is ending up all in one touch to cover this distance. I mean, that's great. That should be his target each time. I'd be preferable if that he could get this plant foot potentially a little bit more here toward the side of the ball as opposed to behind it. But because this isn't like a big distance pass and he's not hitting with a lot of power, he can make solid contact at the center part of this ball from this position and hit it back here. And then I like the upper body here, arms out to the side, head down tracking the ball. He's in a good position for success here. Here what you're seeing is very slow movement to get across into this position to be able to hit a one-touch return pass, which is causing him immediately to be off balance and overextend with this leg. It immediately puts his hips in an awkward position because that plant foot is facing this direction, and he's not able to create any sort of power or force or anything to hit the ball back here. So the fix will continue to be for him to get to these positions much quicker, get your body in a ready state to be able to pass in a balanced manner. That would be the core focus I would have for this player if he's training one-touch return passes. Yeah, one thing I like about this is he's receiving the ball. The ball just was passed into him here and he's receiving it across his body by bringing that right foot across in this direction. You can see he's presenting a nice surface inside of the foot technique. That ankle is locked. The toe is up. You can see that clearly in this picture here. That looks good. And he's contacting the ball at this midpoint. So he's pushing the ball this way and it's at a good angle with the foot that'll push the ball up this direction here. So I do like that. He looks like he's in okay balance. His arms are slightly out to the side on this side here. You can see that. So showing decent balance, tracking the ball with his eyes. Clearly like this is the target of what he's concentrating and paying attention to. So overall not a bad picture I think for taking the ball across your body in one touch with the inside of your foot. So right away I'm looking at as the ball's leaving the partner's foot and coming to his body here, you can see very clearly that he's flat-footed, not in any sort of prepared body state to make a quick adjustment if the ball were to be poor, or if you'd like to push off and move in this direction. So he's not ready from that perspective, a very light bend in his knees. I like that he has a forward lean and he's tracking the ball with his eyes, so that's good, but he could be more prepared just by being on the balls of his feet, ready to make an adjustment with his body if necessary.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I would have preferred to see him keep the cucumbers a little bigger and have them around the same size instead of rough chopping it. I can understand rough chopping the onions. Nobody really wants to eat a big onion. But you want to have the cucumber and the tomato maybe around the same size. It goes with better presentation and a better texture and contrast for the salad. First of all, I would like to see him giving himself more room to work with. He's got a whole bunch of ingredients that has nothing to do with the dish that he's making. He's making cucumber tomato salad. He has eggs. Yes. Sugar. He has a little bit of everything in his work area. So he should be able to give himself some room just so he can get stuff done in a timely fashion and not be working in a bunch of clutter. He needs to really get himself some more room to work with and definitely work on his hand placement while holding the cucumber and how he's handling the knife. Now, he should take that with onions and put it right in the bowl so he can give himself some time to work on the tomatoes. The other thing, you know, he's sitting down cooking. Like, that's like the cardinal sin, my chef. You know, I mean, I get it. He's home and everything, but you stand up and you do your cut work. That shows me that he's a lazy chef.

It's important that the dancer keeps his head level while he's spinning or doing a revolution in a circle because looking upward or looking downward either or can make the dancer a lot more dizzy and make the turn more difficult to complete then. Instead, the dancer should keep his eyes level, straight in front of him, bringing his chin a bit downward.

I would just repeat my comment about being very intentional about where you place the arms and using the arms as an anchor in order to be able to move throughout the space and travel more efficiently. Here I would repeat my comment about being overly dramatic in the shoulders in order to improve this movement to look a little less stiff and also to be released tension in the hands as well as to help to look a little bit less stiff and then finally also using the full wingspan or being very intentional about arm placement as anchors while you travel. Overall the footwork though has been really amazing and showing those hips sending those hips back and of course those knees bent to show this great range of motion is a wonderful demonstration that this dancer shows us. The dancer does a great job of moving with energy to improve this movement where they go from high and kind of circle their body low. I would make sure to be very intentional about taking up space. So really expanding from both fingertips all the way through the toes and making their body as big as possible at the top here and then turning their body, bringing it all low, collapsing into a ball. So this is when they go the goddess shim shami with you, that movement right before this one. And it just communicates the different levels to the dance to the audience, but also shows how to do the basic choreography in the most dramatic way. So it's very clear on people trying to learn these steps. This is another example of them doing a great job of using their hips and bending their knees and swinging their arms. I would just repeat the note about making sure to take their head with them. The dancer is kind of creating these up swings with their arms and then these down swings in different directions. And they're doing a great job of using their hips. You can see in this moment that their hips are pushed back and that their knees are bent. So they have this great range of motion to improve this movement as they swing. And just to create another element of pizzazz and energy that we're used to seeing in a Shim Sham Shimmy is that as they swing their arms up and swing their arms down, I would take their head with them. So as their arms go up, so does their head. And they look up as their arms go down and they would also look down. Here the dancer does some very intricate footwork and as I previously mentioned the Shim Sham Shimmy is sometimes done with a partner and no tap shoes on and then at other times it's done with a tap shoe. So it's very very important when you are doing a Shim Sham Shimmy to imagine that you are always wearing a tap shoe because then you're very conscious about the rhythm. So I would encourage this dancer to every single time they step to be very intentional about being on the rhythm and to strike their ball of their foot into the ground creating a rhythm with their body inside the rhythm that's already happening within the music. This is just takes that Shim Sham Shimmy to a professional dance level but they're already doing an amazing job of doing the basic choreography but not only does it take it to a professional even more professional level it also becomes very clear to the audience what the rhythm is in the body versus what the rhythm is in the music. I just want to highlight this moment right now because when I was talking about using the torso and engaging the torso moving back and forward, this is a great example of the dancer using their torso as they twist their knees and bring their arms from up to down. So just wanted to highlight that this is exactly what I'm talking about and I would love to see that throughout. But overall this moment, phenomenal. This was a great example when they're twisting their shoulders and pointing towards the ground and moving forward. They do that move pretty excellent and they use their fingers to twist in and out. Because it's a shim-sham-shimmy and jazz dance is a lot about isolation, which means to move one part of the body at a time. And those isolations, just a little history that those isolations end up in jazz dance music, end up giving birth to funk, which then gave birth to hip-hop. And from jazz dance, we isolated those beats, right? So it's all about isolating the beats in the body. So I say all that to say that is the reason that when you do those shoulders and you twist in and out pointing down, you want to be overly dramatic with those shoulders. So every single time the dancer points down, they can also overly twist their shoulders in and out. This is off the back. I know that this is a shim sham shimmy. The dancer really exhilarates high energy which is needed because it's usually a partner dance that you find in like Lindy Hop or different jazz areas. And it also, a shim sham shimmy also can become a tap dance. So already great energy and I'm excited to finish this video. I've already watched it one time. I just want to say in my sixth comment, I made a little bit of a mistake. I was talking about how the torso should be is currently upright and then the legs are bent and how you want to take the torso back and actually push the hips forward to create that shape again and while keeping the knees bent. So I meant to say hips. I think I meant I think I said torso and shoulders, but your torsos, your shoulders are stacked on top of the torso and then the hips are pushing forward to kind of create this bent knee shape where you bring your hands down into the rainbow and twist in and out. The dancer then works through a series of movements. They stop, they pause, they travel, they strike some poses, they jump, they turn. Because of this, I would be very clear on when to start and when to stop, because again, it's all about the isolation within the body, within the rhythm and within the music. So when are you going? When are you stopping? This dance is less about flowing all of the movements and piecing all of the movements together to create this no soft edges. It's really about when do you stop and start? I like to think of like a drill team. So yes, when do you stop? When do you start? And being clear and really strong in those freezes and then those poses to create, to communicate that in the Shim Sham Shimmy. This is another moment as when they go, I'm going to take that step. And their arms are going from up to down while their knees are twisting down. They can also lean their torso back or lean their shoulders further back than their hips. So it looks like this. So instead of them being up in this upward motion that we see right now, their torso would be leaned back and their shoulders would push front and their legs are bent. So they're leaning back while they're twisting in and out. On this part, I want to shimmy shammy with you or I'm not the best singer but They do they bring their arms from all the way up top and they kind of create this I call it a rainbow or they like paint their hands coming down and their knees twist in and out Because it's supposed to be a fun reprieve What I would do is lean the torso back as they come down for I want to shimmy shammy with you This is we seen we see this a lot in Shim sham shimmies and it also is it's Representative of the joyful expression of a shim sham shimmy. So that's just a minor detail but overall they did a really wonderful job of bringing their arms down and Shaking their knees or twisting their knees in and out The dancer begins with a Charleston, which is the step front and step back. They step front with that leg and then that this stationary leg stays in one place and then they step back as well. And they kind of follow this step front, touch in, step back, creating a Charleston. To improve this Charleston, the dancer does a great job of using their arms, but I would accentuate it even further. Just to add a bit of clarity to it is by really working on flexing those hands from the palm so they can create this iconic Charleston shape that we're used to seeing from the 1920s flappers.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She loses her clear arm choreography. Instead, her arms are just kind of to her side in a very natural pedestrian way. Also, as she's performing these jumps, she really needs to bend her knees more and drop that pelvis back. That grounding would help her to move through the jumps more quickly and efficiently, and perhaps help her to maintain the rhythmic embodiment. As the dancer begins with the basic salsa step, step touching side to side without locomoting through the space, she demonstrates that she has an understanding of the movement vocabulary, though it might be a little bit more beginner. She's able to incorporate choreography of the arms as well as incorporate some movement of the pelvis and the spine. She would benefit from bending her knees more deeply and dropping that pelvis back so that she starts more grounded in her movement, but overall seems to have a sense of rhythmic embodiment as she's performing this basic step. As the dancer performs a series of quicker steps, it shows here that she would really benefit from grounding in her movement a bit more by bending those knees and dropping the pelvis back, because she's not able to move through this series of movements as quickly as the tempo and the rhythm of the music calls for. Also, by grounding through her movement a little bit more, she would activate a greater range of motion in her pelvis, which here in this moment where she's performing a body roll, would help her to get more range of motion through her shoulders, her spine, and her pelvis, which would also be shown in a bend through her knees, as well as including her head in this body roll. As the dancer starts to locomote through the space, moving this basic salsa step forwards and backwards, she's got a nice sense of choreography in her arms, which is very clear, and she's able to stay connected to the rhythm primarily through her footwork. She's also engaging her head in a rhythmically meaningful way. She would benefit, again, from bending those knees and dropping the pelvis back so that she's more grounded, and she's able to activate a greater range of motion in her pelvis, which would help her to increase her dynamics in this performance.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The dancer does a wonderful job of keeping her arms in a straight line. The only issue is that she's breaking the line at her wrist. At her wrist she's flicking upward with her fingers so it changes the line. Instead the dancer should be in a completely straight line. The dancer's head movements here when she's rotating or nodding her head back and forth is not aligned with the rest of her spine and it's a bit distracting from the rest of the movement. I would encourage the dancer to lift her focus a little bit higher. Her chin is tilted downward a bit, so she's looking a little bit downward. So if she just tilts her chin up a little bit higher, this position would be better. The dancer does a nice job with her right arm of straightening it back behind her but she doesn't complete the full revolution when she's rotating her arm backwards and around. It starts to go backwards and around but then actually doesn't complete the revolution before she drops her arm. The dancer's left thumb is a bit stiff here. She's creating a bit of a V shape between her fingers and her thumb, like her forefingers and her thumb. They're separated so much that she's creating this V here, which is not necessary. Really her fingers should be together instead of this like awkwardly extended V position. The dancer is looking towards the corner of the room. I believe she's looking at her dance teacher through the mirror for the choreography cues, but that changes her whole positioning because now since she's opening up her head towards that left diagonal front of the room, her shoulders are also turning towards that position of the room and her chest is turning towards that position and her hips are also turning towards that position. So it changes what the dance step actually is because right now she should be her full body and torso should be facing the front, but she's at an angle because she's looking for choreographic cues from her teacher. The dancer's wrists and arms are a bit stiff here, but her upper body in terms of her ribcage is doing a wonderful job of moving in circles in this position. She could actually bend her knees even further. Her knees are slightly bent here, but they can be bent even further so that she's grounded, so that she could have even more mobility while she's dancing in this stationary position. The dancer lifts her right knee up musically as the vocal makes a higher noise. It comes to a climax, it gets louder. Her knee hits upward at its highest position at that exact moment. So she's mimicking the music through her body. That's great. The dancers can also press her shoulders down a little bit so that her neck is longer and she can make this easier for herself by pulling up in an oppositional force, pulling up from her head so that she creates space for her neck and then from her shoulders pulling downward. So her shoulders should be pulling downward, her head should be pulling upward, and then her arms are both pulling outward. And this is a way for her to remain balanced because she's pulling in all these oppositional forces at the same time. So all of this culminates to her being centered and then she won't have any lack of balance in any which direction because she's pulling equally in every direction at the same time. The dancer's weight is pushed onto her toes, which is great. Her heels are off the ground, which is giving her a lot of mobility in her hips and her knees to twist side to side. The dancer could have more energy in her hands when she extends them outward whether it's forward or up She should be finishing that line completely It's very nice that she is dancing calmly but dancing calmly and completely at the same time is ideal When the dancer is stepping outward right and left, she could be stepping her feet further out from her body. She's instead making smaller steps. But especially since this dance step is not really a traveling step, she should be making it bigger by extending her right leg and her left leg out further from her body. The dancer does a great job of focusing outward here, but her left shoulder is a bit high. She doesn't have much of a neckline here because her shoulder is so high. So she was to bring her shoulder down, keeping her left arm straight as it is, but a little bit lower, so that it wouldn't be so high and close to her ear. Her shoulder is a bit in her ear here. That would create more space for her neck. The dancer is breaking the line at her wrist once again with her fingers changing direction from whichever way her wrist is pointing. The dancer is breaking the line at her wrist. At her wrist, her hand is bending downward, both her hands, but she could have more energy coming out of her fingertips. It's nice that she's relaxed, but her energy can be in a straight line out of her wrists instead of pointing downward.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And we can still hear the coffee percolating in the background so not ready yet And then looking at his coffee drink, it's a very, very light brown. This is kind of the color that you would typically see at a place like Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts if you've gotten iced latte because they tend to put a lot of milk in there. So maybe that's what he was going for. But also a latte is typically brewed with espresso. I obviously can't tell what kind of coffee is in the pods. And worth noting that some people brew espresso with regular coffee beans and that's perfectly fine. But this wasn't brewed as espresso, it was brewed as coffee. So it's a different product. And he's putting the cap back on. I can hear the coffee machine working so the coffee is starting to percolate. I can't tell exactly how much water he added. Measurements would be great for this. Just looking at it, it might be just a tad on the light or weak side. I think it maybe is a lot of water for a little bit of coffee. But that's just from visual observation and I can't know that for sure. He tapped out the last bit of the coffee in the pod and now he's picked up an electric kettle. I'm not sure if there's cold or hot water in there, but he's going to pour that into the coffee maker. And at this point the cook is just standing here waiting, nothing to do. But wait at this point as it doesn't look like he intends to heat up the milk. I cook walk back over to the counter where the coffee is brewing and set the jug down. And here the cook is pouring the coffee into his milk It's hard to tell from the screen how much coffee did brew it It kind of sounds like the the coffee machine is still working. So I'm not sure if more coffee would have percolated it from the pourer right here it looks like it's Maybe just a little on the weak side, but not not as light as I expected it to be Alright, and it looks like he maybe hit a switch on the bottom to turn it off, hard to see, but the cook has pulled the coffee pot from the coffee maker and he's about to pour it into his milk. And now the cook walked over to his refrigerator and he's pulling out a gallon of milk. Here the cook is adjusting the pot underneath the coffee maker. There's no practical reason to do this, I think probably just something to do with his hands while he waits. Here the cook is preparing to make the coffee. He's picked up a K cup or like a Keurig sized brewing pod and he's opening the foil up. Normally for these pots you put them into a machine that's designed to receive them and not open the foil but it looks like he's going to be using the coffee grounds in a different application. and he's walking over to his refrigerator and returning the milk to the fridge. Which is good. And he's filling his glass about halfway with the cold milk. Here the cook just pulled out and set down the glass he'll be using. And now the cook is opening the lid and looking into it. Again, no practical reason to do this either. It might just be keeping his hands busy or maybe he's looking to see how much water has already passed through the coffee to estimate how much time is left. And here the cook is pouring the water into the reservoir in the coffee maker. Here the cook has opened the top of a percolating style coffee maker.

He's basically walking and he's bringing her around with him. Again, the issue though is that they're not on the music. So it looks pretty impressive because they're turning quite quickly. But if you take a closer look, you can tell they're not on the beat together. So, you know, it's important to remember that this style of dance really is about embodying the music and demonstrating the music in the body. That's what I guess what embodying music means. And so that's the most key component and they're missing that a little bit here. All right, so I know he's probably trying to be funny here, but it's not coming across very well. He just, because the singer is doing this, this very quick, rapid, rhythmic scatting, he's sort of doing this like shake through his whole body. And I think she thinks that's funny too, which is adorable. It's very cute, but it doesn't come across very well because it's not precise or deliberate enough to come across very well. And it's also confusing to her because, I mean, I don't know if it's confusing to her, but it very clearly has made them, again, not coordinated anymore because in order to do that moment, again, he's lost the beat. He's lost the basic foundation. They miss each other here unfortunately. He does reach out to her. They try to catch each other, but they miss each other. Partly because they're not super well connected. They're not making good eye contact. So she's doing a good job of getting back onto that foundational step and continuing to do it Even though she's doing a bunch of different moves like going in one direction and turning and all of that He needs to also do that. It's making her do more work To stay on the beat because he's not staying on the beat. He's got a lot of stillnesses He's got a little bit of offbeatness and so she has to overcome that in order to stay on the foundational step and to stay on the beat and that might be why she's not exuding a lot of energy and a lot of joy, because she's probably going to focus more than he is because she's Choosing to do the right thing by staying on the foundational step. So he's actually kind of overpowering her And asking her to do more work than she should do That was a good little moment. They had this good pulling back with both of their weight, which created a nice tension here that they're now recovering from in a good way. And they're also on the opposite foot of each other. So that means that they're back to being better coordinated. Here you can see he's striking with the heel of his foot and she's flat footed as well. So again, I really would prefer for them to be up on the balls of their feet so that they could move more efficiently, smoothly and in a light way. Cause this style of dance is meant to be done in a light way. So, she gets thrown off balance again here because at the last second on this last beat, he decides to throw his weight forward onto one foot and that causes her to lose balance. So he needs to be a lot more clear if he's going to do some kind of rogue movement like that that she knows, like somehow communicates with her that he's going to do that or do it when they're not touching because it throws her off balance in a way that's very obvious and obviously not deliberate. She's kind of throwing herself off balance here and it looks super weak. It's kind of like this weak head position, weak arm position as she comes through, kind of this rag doll vibe. You know, that doesn't quite fit with the style of music or with this particular song. So it would be much better if she was just very controlled and brought her arms straight out into a beautiful shape here. Again, he's really feeling the music. They're doing these big turns and it looks really, really strong, but they're not really in the pocket with the beat. So that's what I really need them to work on because that's the most important thing about this style of dance. Totally off beat here again. I appreciate that he's feeling the music, but the music here goes blue, blue, blue, and he's stepping just after the blue. So it's like blue step, blue step, blue step. And so it doesn't work. It's not coordinated. He needs to get really in the pocket with the music, especially if he's going to try to do fancy things that emphasize the music. He needs to actually emphasize the music and be in the pocket with it. That's a good turn here. He did a good job of bringing his arm up quickly so that, which the arm that was connected with her arm, so that she knew that oh, I'm supposed to turn, but also I'm supposed to let go. So that was good leadership and also good following on her part. They miss each other again. This time it's because he reached out to her while she was turning, so she just didn't physically see him. And now, and also because he's traveling this way, so now she's not going to catch him this time. This is a really great moment. This is one of their better, one of the best moments I've seen them do so far. He's doing this little knee clacking back and forth and he's pretty much on the beat, which is really nice. And at the same time, she's also featuring herself. She's not just like, all right, you get to do your fancy thing. She's like, I'm gonna do something that I think is fancy that I can do really well. And that's for her to use his body weight to do a beautiful arc backwards. This is the first time I've seen really good energy and strength out of her arms. Her head is all the way back. She's doing this really nice controlled arc backwards, which is this beautiful kind of slow, smooth movement while he's doing this super fast staccato kind of downward movement. So it's just a beautiful contrast between the two of them. They're using each other's weight to help them stay balanced while they do this. And it also fits with this moment in the song because there's this big saxophone long tone and she's imitating that with her arc, but he's imitating the kind of underlying beat of his legs, really nice moment. Again, he's kind of back into being in his own world, and that's just not helpful in partner dancing. If he wants to do a little bit of a different thing, like he's doing here with the step touch, then what he should do is somehow direct her so that they're separate again, and they do some more of their own solo moments. He's not doing that, and so he's kind of leaving her in the dust, and that's unfortunate. It's kind of like throwing her under the bus, and it makes it more about him than about their partnership, and that's very obvious. They're back on the foundational step. Yay, that's great. And they're on the beat. I love it. I want them to keep it up. This is what I want them to embrace throughout the piece. I really appreciate that the leader is like really feeling the music and he's putting a lot of energy into what he's doing. He's attacking his movements, which is really excellent. He's, you know, because he's enjoying himself, it's easy to ignore the mistakes that he's making. And, you know, if I were just a regular old audience member and I weren't analyzing this and didn't have experience analyzing dance, I might think this was an excellent performance because he's putting so much energy into it. So that's really good. My issue is that he's not really staying on the tempo with his footwork and he's not coming back to the basic step to indicate to his partner what's supposed to happen. It's like he's kind of in his own world a little bit. And so, you know, just making sure that he really communicates well with his partner, stays on the basic foundational steps, stays on the beat so that he can stay well coordinated and connected with her. That's pretty cute, actually. This was more of an effective moment. He's doing this thing where he's kind of pliaying down and doing this really rapid shake with the knees and then straightening up and then going back down again. But what he's done really well is he stayed connected to her and he's also kept the tension and is in the arms and is guiding her appropriately to where he wants her to go, even though he's doing this little funky moment here. And the funky moment is successful because it's very sharp, it's very deliberate, and also because he's doing it while he's opened away from her. The audience and the viewer can actually watch what he's doing while she's away from him. So that was a really good choice. Yeah, he try as a leader He tries to come out of the foundational step too often like as soon as he establishes it. He lets it go again So here he's gone into this sort of step kick He only did the foundational step twice and then went into a step kick She kind of tried to keep going with the foundational step. He's trying to make make these big changes too quickly And maybe it's because he thinks it's boring to just do the foundational step over and over again But doing the foundational step over and over while adding complicated things like turns is actually how you do partner dancing So he's kind of missing some of that actually a lot of that basic concept They're starting off pretty strongly here. They're right on the beat of the music. Also, they're putting energy into what they're doing so that it starts to, so it kind of matches the high energy of the music. It would be even better though and more energetic if they were dancing on the balls of their feet. There's a heaviness and a clunkiness and a lack of movement of this, and like this, a finality of stepping on a flat foot that takes away from that exuberance. Also, their frame's pretty weak. This arm really shouldn't be moving up and down that much, and the frame here is also kind of collapsed. This is a good little section here because they're well coordinated again. They're stepping on the beat It's really nice because they're taking pretty big steps as they cross over here And so it has this exaggerated feel to it that matches the music and makes it look very performative Again, totally lost the beat, although I can tell he's still enjoying the music. That's great because that does help to distract from the fact that he's not stepping on the beat. He's kind of, you know, moving his head a little bit here. He's really enjoying the music. He's attacking his steps, which is great. So he's bringing a good energy to what they're doing here, but he's not bringing enough technique. She's also not really meeting his energy. She's quite less precise and less strong with her shapes. You can see that in this arm position here that's kind of not precise and sort of reactionary. That moment up with this knee actually works better for her here and I think it's because she did the knee up very sharply and right on the beat. They kind of lost the beat there again, so really important to stay right on that tempo. And if you get off beat, get right back on as soon as possible. Not sure why she lifted her knee here. It doesn't quite make sense in this moment. It's not really a motif that they've established so far, so it looks, it just looks a little bit, it looks unnecessary. It's pretty clear and precise. She's quite strong in the position here, but it doesn't quite fit with the rest of the choreography. Kind of lost the beat a little bit there, but now they've got back onto it pretty quickly. So that was a pretty good recovery. I'd love to see a stronger frame for both of them so that they're not so close together and so that he's not sort of like pulling her in like this. I think she needs to be a little bit more centered on her own weight with a stronger shoulder and a stronger frame here. I lied, they did catch each other. Good. Second attempt, they caught each other. And this is good leadership here. He's raising the arm up so that she has plenty of room to turn under him. Pretty good frame for her as well so that she can turn her whole body and not just her shoulders. This is a nice moment because even though he's not continuing with the basic foundational step, he's still holding really strongly to her arm so that she can continue the step, but he can have this kind of special moment that he's doing here. It's really nice. He's risen up to a very straight position here and has brought this arm up to an extension. You know, he does lack a little bit of quality of good line making and clearly doesn't have a lot of experience moving from the core outward, but I'll still give him that this is a this is an interesting moment and a good shape.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They're very smooth and it's easily accessed from all fingers on all strings. Tempo is a little wonky here. Intonation on that arpeggio was a little on the flat side, and every time that first finger in third position was placed on a G, also tended to be a little on the flat side instead. A chord there could have been improved with a little bit more forward or back motion of the hand here, allowing for more connection between the two strings. Rather than pulling back would create more sound on the higher string, and pulling out would create more sound on the lower string. So if you were to equal that out, you'd be able to get a lot better sound on both strings at the same time. Overall, bowing on the string looks really good here for the G, D, and the A string, but tends to be a little up and down-ish when they're on the E string. Bow use looks pretty good. There's a lot of flexibility in the fingers here and the bow is nice and straight along the contact point here. It does tend to be a little too far out this way and then too far back this way sometimes depending on where they are in the bow. intonation there with the last four fingers. The intonation right there was a little off. A little bit of flare of the fingers up right before they play. This is called a fly-away finger in my studio, and I would just advise the student to try to keep the energy tight closer to the string. A little too much rubato here, she slowed down by accident. Really nice trills here. Those are very difficult to get in time and they sound very pretty and are in time very well. Intonation overall sounds pretty good. intonation Sending posture looks really good. Instrument comes out of the neck at a really good angle. I feel like the lower string patterns that you're hearing, one lower note, bumby, anybody, anybody, anybody, I think they're not speaking as clearly. And this musician could afford to pluck the strings almost off of the string when they're getting to that lower note. So as they're playing this note, they could pluck away this direction rather than fly away up this way. The plucking of this direction will actually help the notes speak more clearly. Shifting seems really efficient and easy and you can see that the elbow moves really nicely underneath the instrument to allow appropriate access for pinkies on every string. E string notes tend to have a bow that's a little bit more back like this, which keeps the bow near this fingerboard section. I would advise, just like this hand is far out, mimicking this motion, but on the E string. Therefore, the bow can be this way, and keep that bow contact point right in the middle of the string there. speeding up here tempo-wise. You can really see that flat third finger here. I would just ask that to be more curved Thumb is a little far down underneath the fingerboard here. That promotes a flatter finger when playing, especially while trying to vibrate. I would advise thumb to come up slightly more and pull the wrist under as to create more curve of the fingers.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Even though she made a lot of mistakes in the beginning, I think the ending definitely made up for it. She finally just found the steps and her groove and definitely in this part she's able to do all those steps correctly and to the music but still keeping a bit of personality and bounce into the movement. So keeping the movements really light and free-flowing. So with the head roll, that could have definitely been a much larger head roll, really dropping that head down below the shoulders. The knees are bent nicely, but definitely can extend the range in the rolling of the head. So in the eight steps that she took from here around to here, nice job there. Just looking at her feet, she was dancing on the balls of her feet, knees were slightly bent, and she was able to travel well doing all of the steps precisely. So here's one part where I noticed how well this dancer really uses like the flow of her body. So really moving her spine side to side, moving her hips with her knees bent in this position and this movement and she's stepping outside the side. She's able to really bend and move from the knees and like the whole body from the floor up. Just kind of have this really nice flow going up. So really nice job there. It was a really nice turn. She did like a double turn spin around from here and then around and then one more time around in place. So really nice job. She was definitely spotting her head around to get the turn faster and it was clean and there were no steps, extra steps taken in between. So the beginning is clear. She just wasn't quite sure of the beginning steps. So I'm not going to really comment on that. So really nice job rotating the arms around. They were straight and they went all the way around fully without her bending the elbows at any point until she was completely done. And here she's unsure what to do, so we'll move on to the next part. So those last little eight counts that she just did where she reached her arms out in this area, really nice job there, nice extension of the arms, nice job moving throughout the space and the turn and keeping herself together. And then again, I think she just kind of mixed up what she wasn't unsure of what she was supposed to do next.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She still has a really great hand position and posture and technique throughout. And then we lighten up. So you can see that even though her hand is very Extended and she's covering a wide range. She still has that nice beautiful Hand position and technique everything is feeling very delicate and it's keeping those phrases in check Alright, we have that theme returning again. All right, we kind of change moods here and you can hear kind of that shift in her sound and we can hear the difference in the articulations and the dynamics throughout. Alright, and then we start that section over again. She is doing a nice job with contrasting dynamics so that we can hear the difference in those sections and really bringing out those phrases between the left and right hand. Right, we have a little bit of note discrepancy there. So again, just kind of isolating those smaller chunks of notes that tend to give us trouble so that we can clean up those patterns. Alright, and we have that note kind of popping out there again and it's very abrasive. I am feeling at this point that it's definitely the keyboard. Yeah I'm bringing those notes out. All right, so there is a bit of variation from this In this section from what she played the first time it seems a bit softer and a little bit more delicate I like that. I like the interpretation of that and so just continuing on that pattern And even though we have those lower pitches, we still have that lighter flow. All right, the pianist starts, she has a very good posture, she has very good hand position. Her left hand is bouncing between these notes up here and these notes down here, and she has a nice contrast between her left hand and right hand with her articulation. Alright, and so at this point I am confident in that Low E flat right here on the keyboard being really Abrasive it just sounds louder than all the pitches around it, but as we get through this section right here she is it is becoming more commanding and Intentional and this you can see the strength in her hands as she continues to play that kind of gives aid to that difference in that phrase A different style altogether, very well done with phrasing and the dynamics. It's a very delicate touch. She's doing a nice job with her pedaling. Overall, very well done. All right, and then she starts that section over again And We are just coming back into that it it brings that dynamic level down slightly In this section right here, the left hand is a bit heavier than my personal preference, so I would lighten that up a little bit and then bring the right hand out a little bit more. Or, if you bring the left hand down enough, that might be good enough to kind of hear what's going on in that right hand. Alright, so overall it's it's really well done. She has a really even and consistent tempo Throughout that little middle section right there. It did slow down and speed up slightly And so just kind of looking at that to keep it even and consistent throughout", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So now all the steps that he is doing are smaller and not done with as much ownership as the steps he was doing previously. The dancer makes a mistake here and turns counterclockwise, but he was meant to turn the other way clockwise. The dancer can also lift his front heel, so his left foot, higher off the ground so that this twist is bigger and easier to see with more mobility. The dancer's twist here with his left leg is very small and subtle and hard to see. The dancer forgets the routine here and is shuffling his feet. He got confused between some of the dance steps here and has lost his place in the sequence. The dancer begins to bend his left arm at the elbow, but it instead should be in a straight line diagonally pointing upward. The dancer can articulate this body roll more through his spine So that every part of his vertebrae is used And it should look like a wave that he's doing but he just cuts this short The dancer is doing a job of taking large steps. When he's doing this basic salsa step forward and backwards, he's taking up a large amount of space on the floor. This movement could also be accentuated if the dancer raises his left hip into the air while still maintaining his left foot on the ground. So if his hip poked outward, it would also be easier to see this movement. Instead, the dancer should be twisting to a larger extent from his hip joint, his knee joint, and his ankle joint, all twisting inwardly towards the right side of the room. The dancer is also traveling equidistantly, so when he goes forward versus when he goes backwards, the distance that he's traveling is exactly the same, and when he returns to center it is his true center, given he's traveling equidistantly in both of these directions.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

We need to make sure that all three of these notes have equal volume. The guitarist is playing this etude faster than he is able to play it with stable rhythm. When you're hearing different notes of this arpeggio come out louder than other notes, ideally every single note of the arpeggio would be as present and as loud as any other note. We are hearing a slight pause in the tempo as a guitarist descends these arpeggios. Ideally the tempo would be consistent. The recommended course of action would be to play these slightly slower so that the guitarist is able to get to that next note of the arpeggio without having a break in the rhythm. The thumb and fingers I, M, A, D, fingers 1, 2, 3, 4, are slightly out of sync rhythmically. The solution to this would be to really think of fingers 2, 3, 4, or I, M, A, D as a unit and move them as such, instead of letting each finger move slightly independently in the right hand. This is a good example of electric guitar technique. Although the thumb is hanging slightly over the fingerboard, we see that the palm of the hand through the thumb in the left hand is very relaxed and that's going to allow for a lot of mobility. So while that isn't the exact technique for classical guitar, on electric guitar that is an example of good left hand technique. This is an example of good left hand technique because we can see that with each knuckle in the left hand fingers there is a gentle curve and then we can also see that the guitarist is playing with his fingertips holding down the string. So it's a great example of how to use the left hand fingers on the fretboard. The guitarist is plucking the lower strings too hard, which is causing them to buzz. Especially when plugged into an amp, we need to rely on the sound of the amp to create our volume and pluck lighter on these low strings so that they don't buzz. We're hearing a bit of a twangy sound on the upper strings. This is because the guitarist with finger number four in the right hand, or finger A, in the right hand is not getting enough of his nail onto the string to pull a clean tone. We're hearing the nail scrape against the string. The guitarist's guitar is not properly in tune. Some of the strings are slightly flat. We hear that the top note of this arpeggio is muted. That is because the first finger is touching the string that needs to vibrate. Because it is too clamped on the guitar, we need to make sure that each finger is only touching the string that it is holding down, and that it is curved enough that it is not touching any other string. If it touches another string, it will mute that string when the string attempts to vibrate. Now we are hearing that the top note has more volume than the lower notes. So again, we need to make sure that all three fingers have the same volume. This would be most easily executed by thinking of those three fingers as one strumming motion in the hand, as opposed to three independent fingers plucking at the same time. We're hearing a little bit of buzz in the notes played with finger P or the thumb in the right hand. This is because the pluck of the string has slightly too much outwards motion, motion away from the guitar, as opposed to motion straight down toward the floor. That motion up and away from the guitar is causing the string to vibrate back down into the metal fret bars, which is why we hear that buzz. So the ideal thing would be to have all of the motion of the pluck be straight down toward the floor so it does not vibrate back into the fret bar. The guitarist did a nice job of bringing out the movement in the bass notes while the upper fingers and the right hand were playing the same chords. It's always important to bring out any moving note. This is a good example of balance between the bass notes and the upper chordal tones. This is what we want to hear when a guitarist plays chords. The bass note is not overpowering the upper notes of the chord.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Upon connection with the ball, we see the player is leaned more along this kind of axis. After connection with the ball, we can see the shift in the axis here. So that heavy plant on the standing foot, trying to get to the ball before it, I guess, hits the side. Causing the player to really twist through the shot. And then that upper body kind of rotating around off of this standing foot, creating that off-balance. And as we can see, the ball heading for the inside of the goal, which is fine, but I feel it's a result of a drag, which is deriving from the rushing to the ball, trying to generate power with one quick step. And coming from the left towards the right-hand side, that heavy plant again just transferring the upper body and swiveling it around. Yes, it's a goal, but not sure if the intention is to drag it this far left, which is what happens. Again, just a super short approach to the ball and we can see the player leaning forward, trying to get momentum into the body before connection with the shot. Again trying to lean back upon connection to get that extra bit of lift on the ball which is not necessarily creating that extra bit of power. Just what I like to see, this player starting back somewhere around this cone or behind to get more momentum in the ball and get a better connection. We can see this shot very average after connection, just kind of lifts up and heads in this kind of area of the goal. Good shot control here as we can see the player facing this cone here, facing this cone here, which is not the direction of the goal. We can see the standing foot is pointing to where the goal is, so they're facing 90 degrees in the wrong direction. The player manages to connect with the ball that's moving slightly this way and follow through and guide it into the goal. Good control on the shot but not a great finish in terms of where the ball enters the goal. But a good follow through considering the little amount of momentum that's in the player's body, a body which is also twisting through the shot. Again, just to look at the approach. Generally, the centre line here. Good angle for a right footed shot. But very short distance. It's just a very short step. It's not even a big one step, it's a short one step. Which is causing the player to have to try to generate power from somewhere. And they seem to be using that little bit of a plant, plus the left arm up in an unusual kind of shape. To try and come across the body and create that power through the cross tension from the upper body all the way through the abs into the lower body and into the hip flexors at the front of the leg. so this one is a moving ball from left to right but what the player does well here is they get their foot standing foot close to the ball even though it is moving away they still manage to time the arrival of the stance in beside the ball and a good follow through with the right foot which ends up going across the body and across the goal into the left hand side again so good finish good overall kick the only negatives of this one just a moving ball and a short approach but nonetheless a decent strike into the goal So kind of hard to see here because of the shorts the player is wearing and also the camera angle. If the leg is fully extended here, where the knee is at, is this just because the shorts are baggy or is the knee bent? Looks quite straight here but again just hard to tell. Nonetheless a decent follow through in this shot, however still kind of central. I like the approaching angle, it was more from the left versus straight on. But the approach length was quite short, again just one to two steps in and trying to generate power with the big plant on the left leg. You can see that's bent. Somewhat decent follow through. Again just hard to know when the leg was extended fully, at what point, was it before the kick, was it just during the kick, just after the kick. It would have been helpful to see that. Again, we kind of see that arm is just kind of bent up in front, almost shielding the body. We can see the right hand here on the outside and this player is kind of trying to rotate the body through the shot to gain that power versus, again, just a longer run up. Don't have to twist too much through the shot, which can potentially cause it to drag towards the left. So interesting technique. Not a bad shot, but still room for improvement here. Slightly better point of entry in this one. A little bit higher, a little bit more closer to that top corner. But still that room for improvement. More right and maybe a little bit higher. But a well struck penalty nonetheless. We're seeing a last kick here. There were three kicks just taken one after the other with very little stoppage, very little set up before the kick. Not really putting the ball down and trying to get any distance between the player and the ball upon the approach. And then another thing to note is we see the foot just after following through here. The shot dragging across the shoulders still facing this way. So it's like the shot is being taken first, then the hips are coming in next, then the right shoulder is coming across next. So no real power being generated from the twist through here. Beforehand it's like they're just swinging the foot and the rest is following. This goes first, this comes second and then this comes next. It's just not a whole lot of power generated. Partially to do with the approach in most of these kicks. 95% of them have been one step approaches from not a super long distance. We've seen some good points of entry and some good finishes on the shot. But definitely room for improvement in a lot of these ones. Again, just another short, slow approach to this one. Just a very average outcome. Kind of entering central low, low power inside of the foot. Definitely room for improvement in this kick. Going with the inside of the foot from such a shorter distance. Got to be trying to get closer to the insides of the posts to put it away as far as possible from the center of the goal. Another decent strike here. We can see inside of the foot as guided the ball. Decent height. We'd just like to see a little bit more aim towards the inside of the post if we're going to use the inside of that foot. Collecting for the accuracy. Many of the shots are coming into these ranges where potential saves from a goalkeeper should there be one in the goal. So just room for improvement. Being closer to the sides more consistently. Also more of a run up so there's not as much of an axis shift from the lean forward to the lean back upon our one step approach to the ball. So a lot of power trying to be generated. This one not ultra powerful with quite a central finish. Again could be a little bit better to the side and then the run up could be a little bit longer to generate that extra bit of power and cleaner follow through without planting too much. And we can see here, ball going wide of the mark, hitting the camera stand. We can see the player before this kick, just not taking that extra couple of seconds to line the shot up, to take a few steps back, to control that run and approach and really try to improve the accuracy and quality of the kick. So again, just rushing and a very short approach. So in this video we're going to be looking at penalties or shots. You see we have two very different views of the kick. We've got a point of view obviously here and then this camera here is the one that is looking at the player so we're going to be seeing the player from kind of a front point of view in terms of stance and a little bit far away. But we will comment on what we can and we will also talk about the rest of the criteria in this video which we will use to get our score. Seeing here, ball hitting just the inside of the post. Nearly an excellent finish. A couple of more inches to the left and it's in a high position close to this top corner. But again, room for improvement. Just a short approach. If we're talking penalty kicks, this is one step, maybe even half a step on this shot. The player's got good ability to guide the shots, generate power, but I feel like there's more potential in this player and in these kicks. In terms of the approach length and just that little bit of patience to line the shot up, I feel like the player is definitely capable of hitting the optimal points, but just kind of rushing the shots and not giving themselves a great foundation before the connection with the ball. So this approach quite short, which is not ideal, but I do like the connection made with the ball nonetheless. It's a Good finish because what the player is doing is they are kind of bringing the right foot around The right side of the ball and creating this anti-clockwise spin so the ball is now spinning like this and And What that causes the ball to do is to kind of curve a little bit so it helps with the placement when going for this side of the goal and Where that could come in handy is if there was a goalkeeper. Let's say the goal was bigger and We've got a goalkeeper again diving Save to try get to this shot Ball is more likely to go around That save attempt versus if it's in a straight line From A to B, A being here B being here The straight line is more likely to be saved Than the curved one so a good shot to the right hand side Good control good spin control and good placement So here we're seeing the player taking a shot with what I feel is their non-dominant foot, being their left foot. A couple of reasons I believe this is because we look at the plant of the standing foot, the distance is much bigger than it has been when the shots have been taken with the right foot. Also, we look at the arms doing similar to what they were doing when the player was taking the shot with their right foot. They should be opposite if they're using the other foot, but they're the same regardless of the foot. Just a little bit more of a twist, and overall just not as comfortable looking, not as powerful a follow through on this one. Just quite a central, average point of entry also on this one. Another kick and another super short approach. This one actually hits this orange ball here, so just low quality overall kick from the approach to the line the ball takes to the trajectory. So this one, good approach and angle coming in from here, not coming straight in, but coming in from the side to allow the right foot to come across the body and through the ball. What I like about the stance is it's good and steady, a little bit lean is fine to allow this right leg to just kind of come through the ball. You can see the player uses the instep, so that's kind of between the laces and the inside of the foot to get that solid connection with the large metatarsal on the inside of the right foot. And the body stays nice and steady all the way through the strike, so good steadiness. If I was to critique it in one way, it just would be that the approach could have been, instead of starting from one step or two steps away, we would like to see at least double that distance on the approach. But a good solid follow through in this one and a good point of entry, kind of entering closer to the inside of the post instead of straight down the centre like the first few kicks. So overall a decent penalty, just wish there was a longer approach to this one. So early on we're seeing quite a slow short approach to the ball We can see players arm kind of bent and up in front and this one kind of out in front also Not a whole lot of power in this and the players able to kind of comfortably hit the ball while standing in this kind of unusual stance and As we can see inside of the foot so opting for the more accurate part of the foot versus the Powerful part of the foot which would be the laces with it with the toe down And we can see that this shot here Goes pretty central. So if we can draw our invisible goalkeeper here It's gonna be a save all day long Ideally we want to see Shots going into the corners or at least in by the posts", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The dancers lose the sequence here with each other. The dancer in the black is crossing his feet left behind right and traveling towards his right while the dancer in the pink shirt is also traveling to his right, but they should be mirroring each other so they would need to be traveling the same direction. And the dancer in the pink shirt also has his feet open so they're not doing the same exact thing here. However, also to extend his arm further up above him, his partner also needs to be reaching a bit higher so that they are both extending their arms and meeting. The dancer in the black was a bit slow in his timing and these opening steps. The dancer's arm is very bent when he is doing any type of spin or rotation. He really needs to extend his arm that's in the air, in this case it's his right arm, further up above him. The dancer in the black is doing a good job of keeping eye contact with his partner. He sees his partner's face in the middle of his view, which means he's looking directly at his partner, which is appropriate. The dancer in the black also missed some of the footwork steps.

Alright, so this is the Dino Boulder, which I haven't seen anyone complete yet, but a climber is miming something that I think is very intriguing. This is the start hold. There's another start hold down here. This is the target hold. I do think you can span this move. Here you see the climber sizing up that span. So it's good to see that people are thinking about the potential to span it. And so here we have the climber setting up for this jump and I think they are swaying too much and so the The way to do a jump is one pump come back and go but this climber here is pumping pumping pumping pumping pumping and You just lose power that way actually so yeah, this is one of those moments where I Say execute after the first pump because if you need more than one you're just thinking too hard about it", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

It has good height as it's slightly below the top portion of the backboard but is well above, I'm excuse me, slightly below the top portion of the square but is well above the top the bottom portion of the square. But since it hit the backboard outside of the square we need to have a good amount of side spin on the ball for it to spin off the backboard and into the basket. On this attempt since he put a little amount of side spin on the ball he didn't put enough side spin so ended up hitting the front of the rim and we missed the shot. You see, as he begins his jump, he has the ball, he has two hands on the ball and as the ball is raising up past his shoulder level, that's when he begins to extend, transfer the ball from two hands to one hand and he extends the ball out in his right hand to make the layup. As the player goes up for a right-hand reverse layup, he shows the proper footwork by making sure he jumps off of his left foot. And he also shows the proper jumping technique by making sure as he explodes off of the ground he lifts his right knee up and gets his right knee up to his waist level. The placement of this ball is inside of the square. As you can see, it's inside of the square. Hits nicely off of the backboard here. And as you can see from here, he gets really good height. And he jumps so high that he was able to just place the ball nice and softly inside of the square for an easy layup. does a really good job of extending the ball out into his right hand. Out high, he keeps the ball high, extended out on his right hand and away from his body. And he also does a good job of getting up his right arm to protect the ball. So if a defender tries to come at this angle, his left arm is there to slow the defender down enough so where he can release the ball out of his right hand before the defense has an opportunity to contest or block his shot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So he's, you know, his body was a little bit lower, he's able to kind of rock over on top of this foot to make this left hand move. So it looks like they're starting to move in just because the reach was too much from the undercling to this right hand up here. Which kind of sets them off this really nice little foot sequence to be able to go immediately right foot low and left foot up to this high one. A lot of the moves leading into it. But getting into that position they look really nice. Arms are nice and engaged. The feet, he's got both feet on and is really kind of twisting in. So his bottom foot is lower but his knee is kind of twisted in nice. So he's doing a really good job of keeping tension on both the feet and kind of maintaining a good equilibrium between the two positions. So he's able to utilize both the feet in this case. And just overall doing a really good job getting opposite poles or having both feet on and balanced out. And really pushing through those feet and not losing the tension and not, you know, relying too much on the arms even though the poles are a little bit more positive. He's still moving through those feet really nicely. And then as he moves up to this pinch, he's able to extend off this right foot. So he's really able to take a lot of that energy and that movement to his feet and just kind of stay stable through the arms, keep the tension.

On the left side, we see her hand, she's kind of pushing the ball opposed to like laying it up. So it's tough to get the proper spin and would signal more of a beginner. Here's the last rep. She shows a little bit of progress here with her shot placement. It's a little closer to the white square, but she needs to build more touch as she gets better and that will give her the opportunity to make more shots. But after watching this video, I'd put it at a probably a 1. Initially, she's starting on her first repetition. Initially, you can see she might be closer to a beginner because she's starting almost in the middle of the paint, where we would want to see players starting right here to get maximum extension and also more similar to a game rep. I would put this at about a one just because she's a beginner and she's more so throwing it off the backboard where you can see with this full arm extension there's no follow through in the hand either. She's kind of just like shot putting it and that's where we see the ball is just going off the backboard. And here we see the placement on the backboard. Significantly outside the white square where you would need pretty advanced spin and a really good angle to get this ball in. Nice extension on this step though, if she could replicate that in the step before.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And we can see that they're doing a good job of trying to hang onto it in the bottom corner right here. Just so that they can actually engage their thumb in a better way too, so that way they can actually hang onto it. And it's a really nice thing to see that as they're making this move here, they're kind of doing an internal rotation of their left knee right here. So by allowing their knee to go inwards, this helps to control what's going on with their body weight. So that a lot of their body weight is directly hanging underneath their right arm. And that their foot now is kind of pushing them up over in that direction. So this allows them to kind of really comfortably move their left hand. Now the trick is to try and place their body weight over onto that left hand, so that they can keep on moving from this position. And so here we can see the climber is now attempting to try and bring their right hand over into this undercling to go in for a match for it. But as they're coming in for that match, we can kind of see that they do a quick little like bounce with their hip. So then that way they can kind of allow their body weight to be up in the air and this kind of helps to reduce the amount of body weight that they have on their left hand. So by doing this, this does make it possible for them to be able to bring in their right hand in the first place. But as soon as the body weight comes back down, which is naturally going to take place, all that increased body weight that's now going to be placed on their left hand and right hand, which is hopefully matching on the undercling hold. That sudden increase of body weight could be too much for them to hang on to, especially because it is an undercling hold. You want to be able to push up into the hold to hold it on to the best way possible. But what we can see is that a lot of the body weight is still kind of hanging out and down from the hold. So this is going to be a very difficult move to complete. So what I would kind of encourage you for the climber is something that they did in the first move, in where they transition their body weight so that they can bring their body weight directly underneath their working hand. And so in this case, they would have to transition their body weight to where most of their body weight is over to the left. So then that way they can hopefully engage that left hand in a better way possible.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The dancer's head is also too far forward. It's not aligned with his spine. We see that his spine has a curvature. His spine should actually be in a straight line. And his head isn't necessarily on that line if we draw from his neck downward. His head is actually in front of the rest of his back. It's really great that the dancer is using his shoulders so much here. He just has to be careful that he doesn't shake his head back and forth too. This movement should be particularly visible in the shoulders and not his head moving also sideways. He only does it slightly but it does distract from his shoulder movement. And instead of the dancer's palm facing his body, his palm should really be facing the floor and not upright. So his arm is a bit twisted and pulled in too far. He can get his spine in a vertically straight line by not slouching over, by moving his vertebrae slightly more forward, moving his head slightly more backwards, and he'd be able to also make room for this adjustment if he pulled up in space from his head, making his neck long. But when the dancer is punching his arm forward, he's doing it very gradually and it lacks, it never reaches like a climax. He should be punching his arm forward and when I say the word punching, I mean punching like he should be extending with more energy forward. It's a bit lackadaisical here. It's okay for the dancer to be punching his arm forward when he's stepping forward right before he turns. It's just in the movements after the turn in which he shouldn't be doing it. The fourth time the dancer does this triple step or step of three, one, two, three steps. He does it with far less energy than the three times before it. He starts out strong with the first one, then the second one is a bit moderate. The third one is like moderate, but slightly weaker. And the fourth one is the weakest. He loses energy as he goes along. And really, he should be keeping his energy at least the same, if not growing more energy. The dancer extends his right and his left arm both forward after he completes the turn and that's unnecessary movements with his arms. His arms should still be going one higher and one lower than each other as he takes each step but he shouldn't be punching them forward here. That is to say that he is closing his arm to his body and instead he should be putting his elbow to the side so that his arm usage is bigger. The dancer's arm movement is a bit awkward and incorrect. His elbows are pointing downwards or backwards, and really they should be pointing out to the side of the room. So his arms should be lifted. Right now his hands are lifted and his elbows pointing down and back, but instead his elbows should be lifted.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He also does well looking on the right side of the frame, having his follow-through extended above his shoulder to allow the ball to continue gaining more arc momentum and power it needs to get above the rim. We also, looking on the right side of the frame, for my player's attempted mid-range jump shot, do not want the player's body momentum to bring him further away from the rim. We want the player to have his momentum carry him straight up and down, allowing the ball to again continue gaining the proper momentum, arc, and power it needs to get above the rim, developing the accurate angle of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the finished result of our player's mid-range attempted jump shot on the right frame, due to our player's lack of balance, we can notice that the ball is hitting the back of the rim, not allowing the ball to continue gaining the proper arc accuracy and rotation it needed to drop inside the rim, however will bounce back off, resulting in an incomplete attempted jump shot. Looking on the right side of the frame as our player is going into his shooting pocket, we can notice that the player does a good job getting his ball placement position above his shoulder before going into his release, creating a much higher arc and rotation to allow the ball to get above the rim, giving it a better opportunity of dropping inside. Looking at the player going into his attempted jump shot on the right frame, we can notice that the player did well at using and incorporating the proper footwork by stepping initially with his left foot first and having his right foot come down, helping him going into his shooting motion. Looking at the player's attempt on his mid-range jump shot on the right frame, we can notice that the player is dropping his follow through too quickly, not allowing the ball to continue gaining the proper arc in rotation and needs to get above the rim. Going towards the right in correct alignment, we will want the player to keep his follow through extended high above his shoulders, having his five fingers and wrists snapped downwards towards the direction of the rim, allowing the ball to continue its proper gain of getting above the rim, developing the proper angle of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the loading position of the player's shooting pocket, as we look on the right frame before he goes into his attempted jump shot, a slight improvement to help the player become more balanced and more powerful going into his release is to widen the player's stance by having his knees go outwards, going into his squatting position. This will also help the player prevent less stress on his knees going into his squatting position, allowing a more fluent release going into his attempt. Looking at the player going into his mid-range jump shot on the right frame, some improvement the player can make to become quicker in his release is to have his body placement position start lower in an athletic stance. This will allow the player to become more balanced as well going into his release. Looking at the finishing result from the player's attempted jump shot, we can notice on the right frame the player provided the right amount of power, arc, and accuracy to get the ball to travel accurately inside the rim, resulting in a completed attempted jump shot. Looking at the player going into his attempt on the right side of the frame, what can help the player on his attempts is to provide the proper footwork, helping him become more squared towards the front of the rim, and also helping him get his feet set so he can get under the ball, providing it more lift, power, arc, and accuracy it needs to get above the rim. Looking at the player going into his attempted jump shot on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player did good getting his follow-through and wrist snapping downward towards the direction of the rim which allows the ball to travel and stay in the correct alignment and ease. However, looking on the right side of the frame we can notice that the player body's momentum is carrying him backwards which does not allow the ball to continue gaining the proper arc momentum and accuracy it needs to develop the proper angle of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the player going into his shooting pocket on the left side of the frame from his mid-range Jumpshot attempt the player does really well getting his shooting hand underneath the ball Allowing his fingertips to rest on the ball while providing a slight gap between the palm and the ball He also does a good job getting his guy hand flat on the side Using it as just a placeholder Keeping the ball in the correct alignment before the release having no effect on the release", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Nevertheless, this is very crowded, and the heel will slip. So here you see the climber taking a ton of time to be delicate with this hand-foot match here.

And in this position we can see that the climber is hanging on with her right hand here. And then she's also using a left foot there. Utilizing a right flagging foot going out to the right. So because she is using opposite points of contact with the wall, and that they're stacked on top of each other, this does allow her to rotate and pivot her body around those two points. But what I'm noticing with this climber is that instead of allowing her body to rotate or pivot in a certain way, we can kind of see that her body is kind of hanging out and away from the wall. So in this opening position that is kind of an okay thing to do just because we can see that her right arm is still able to stay in a straight position, as she reaches up with the left hand. But by allowing her body to sit back away from the wall, this does show that she's not really rotating or pivoting around her foot to kind of place more of her body weight on that foot. So this does make it harder, especially when going into a harder handhold. So for her left hand it does seem like it's a pretty difficult hold for her to maintain. So because she's allowing her body weight to hang out and away from the wall, it's actually making this handhold feel a lot more difficult to hang on to. So I would definitely encourage the climber to really focus on placing her body weight more on her legs, so then that way she can help reduce the amount of strain that her hands are feeling.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

It seems like he's initiating from his hands. Instead, his arms should be moving as an extension of his back. The movement actually should start from his vertebrae and extend outward through whatever direction he moves his arms. His back should be the initiation point. Right now, his arm movements look disconnected from the rest of his body. The dancer's neck is a bit loose. His head is bobbing back and forth when he's stepping forward and back, but his head should be steady on his spine on top of the rest of his vertebrae and not bobbing right and left. The dancer doesn't have a clear spot with his eyes when he's turning. He should be looking in whatever direction he aims to start and finish in. So he started facing towards the windows and he's going to end his turn facing to the windows so he should be looking in that direction and spotting that way. Also he's turning on a flat foot. It hinders his turn and it makes him gain some friction which will cause him to experience a barrier while turning. He should shift his weight onto his toes to avoid this. The dancer is dancing flat-footed. His standing leg is completely flat on the floor. He should be standing closer onto his toes, shifting his weight onto his toes, so that he can execute all these kicks, all these weight shifts more easily and for his movement to be lighter. The dancer doesn't bring his leg directly behind him. It's extended a little bit too far out to his diagonal back and also his leg is bent here and his leg should be completely straight. The dancer starts this routine a count early. He extends his right foot forward, however he does this right before the beat drops, so now he's not going to be on rhythm for all of these steps that he's about to do because he started a bit too early. The dancer does this step incorrectly. He shouldn't be clapping and kicking at the same time He should be kicking stepping back two times and then clapping So when he begins kick step back clap kick step back clap the clap and the kick end up being close in time to each Other but they shouldn't be at the exact same time as he is executing here The dancer also needs to relax his shoulders a bit. They're tense. We see here his shoulders are raised a bit in the air. He doesn't have much of his neck visible. He needs to press his shoulders down so that they are more relaxed and so that his neck is extended. He could do this by pulling up through his head even further. The dancer is curving his spine a bit. Um Really?

He's probably climbing at a much higher level. But it's kind of good to practice those things. I know for me, like warming up, it's good to, you know, if this is part of his warmup, it's like, you know, you still want to climb good, how you're going to climb the rest of the day. So that way you kind of get those movements down. And so then here he does it again, so you can see his whole right side is just opening up. He's got both feet on, he's engaged on the arm. But it's kind of this movement that he could, you know, he could be matched on the left hand or have his right hand low and then kind of shift this knee, get his hips close to the wall and kind of shift his weight over and just move a little bit, maybe move it a little bit better. So, kind of off to a good start. I think, you know, he makes it to the top of the wall, but he does do a couple kind of weird things like dropping his arm a lot. I don't know if it's like to look cool or what, but he kind of drops and lets his one arm hang and then kind of just pulls through on one arm. So, I think the route is pretty easy for him. And so, maybe he's like showing off or trying to look cool or I don't know what the point of it is, but it's kind of like he leans back on one arm and he could kind of stay tighter and pull through with both arms. And then here, you know, you can see he does hit the hold, but he is right hand, right foot, you know, his back is all kind of arched, he's kind of pushing himself way out, you know, so ideally to kind of climb smoothly and when he gets to harder holds, he's going to kind of want to situate, you know, rock his weight over on top of his foot so he can kind of toe straight down, you know, really suction his hips to the wall and just be able to move smoothly. So, yeah, he gets to the top of the wall, but he just kind of does it, you know, it a way that doesn't look, you know, maybe it looks, it's fun to watch and he moves like really loosely and fluidly, but he doesn't really look like he's in control. It kind of looks like he's just kind of floppy moving up the wall. So yeah, like right here he, and it's out of frame, he drops his arm back pretty completely, his right arm. He kind of swings it back, relaxes and then kind of pulls straight through on his right left arm. So I think the holds are just good that he's able to do this, but it's wasting a lot of energy and once he kind of gets some more challenging holds, you know, the idea is that as a better climber, you don't want to spend more energy. Ideally, like the strength and stuff, you can use your advanced strength to kind of make it easier, but this seems to just kind of be, I don't know exactly why he's doing it. Maybe he's warming up and just kind of swinging around and kind of getting loose, but whatever he's doing, it's kind of wasting energy. So I would suggest keeping both hands on and kind of pulling from both hands. That would save a lot of energy.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

It would have been a better and more cleaner movement if the dancer would have used their toe to tap the floor those three times very quickly. And the weight should have been on the left foot when that happened. The dancer doesn't use the full body range to do the body roll.

I would try and make that More in the style that the entire piece has been in All right, pianist is playing with a lot more strength and power in this There's a that the music feels a bit heavier and You can see her hand is a bit more relaxed in that chord position but overall it's still really in control Great, and those trill motifs are really clean. You can hear each of the notes. You know, again, it is attributed to her technique and good hand position and ability to maintain the consistency throughout. Great, and this section you can really feel that in there, and so I would make that previous section sound more similar to this. Nice change in, you know, contrast in style right there. The pianist is doing a nice job with, you know, the alternating hands and keeping those rhythmic patterns very fluid and steady. All right, overall very nice. She had a great Even at steady tempo you can tell that the The phrases were all solid and there was no hesitation in her timing Alright, still maintaining great technique throughout and phrasing. Tempo is consistent and overall very well played. All right, so even though there's those two contrasting sections where the hands are here and here And then they kind of come into the center This the center part is a little bit more harsh. And so we want to relax that a bit and And still feel the beauty of that music And you know maybe kind of feeling that more as a forward phrase movement rather than a Up and down It feels more attacking and so really kind of pushing that phrase forward And And so part of it is I think that she's trying to play very piano and soft and Which is great, but the left hand is not Coinciding with what the right hand is doing currently Overall, again, very well done, very well trained pianist. She maintains her technique throughout and that shows in her phrasing and overall musicality and it's really well done. All right, the pianist has really great posture. She has good finger position. She's a little bit close to the piano, but she's very comfortable. And as she is starting, her notes are very accurate and even in study. And a great little ritard there at the end. She has a nice hold and release and giving us the end of completion of the piece in the phrase. Alright, a nice flow. I really like this phrasing right here where it's a little bit more delicate and lightened up. All right, so in this section, the left hand kind of more accompaniment figure is very prominent and it's difficult to hear the right hand kind of the melody in there. And so I would recommend working through that so that the left hand kind of takes a secondary approach to the right hand and bring out that melody a bit more. So by working out hands alone and really feeling where those stress points are, it would assist the listener in being able to hear the melody all the way throughout. Alright, so throughout this section, again, the pianist is maintaining really good hand position and phrasing. The pedal is a bit heavy, which creates a bit of a muddy sound, and so I would recommend kind of lifting that with some of those phrases to clear out some of that sound so that you can hear each of those phrases independently and fresh with each starting point. So as we come back into this next phrase, or the same phrase back over again, there's a nice contrast to how she ended and then started in that next phrase. And so we can feel each of those phrases going up and down with her hands. I also really like the staccato and preciseness of her articulations.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Highly recommending to get your bass now a little bit lower and you'll be able to explode up a little bit higher. Great job here, coming off the left foot, link it up with the right hand. Great elevation, landing on two feet, good placement there, good layup. Right here, as you can see that first step is actually going that way. He wanted to make sure he get his body turned so he can be congruent to the basket to be able to explode up and get you a little bit quicker versus taking a roundabout route.

Your layup point, that's good. Looks like the ball is targeting towards the white box. Straight up and down, elevated off the ground. Pretty good looking layup. I would say this angle is kind of low. You kind of want to start up higher. Take it downward to get yourself a better angle to be able to identify where the target is, which is the white box on the backboard. Right here, you want to make sure you have your eye look and focus on the target as you're dribbling, getting into a rhythm to lay it up.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Not the footwork we're looking for, we're not really getting off the ground, using our legs so to speak. Again, she lets that rebound come down, kind of slides over. Again, not the footwork we're looking for in the Mike in. Again, she would benefit from just working on the step-through movement all by itself. Take out the shot, take out the basketball. Again, dips that left shoulder here on the left side. All the weight shifts to the left. We want it more weight evenly distributed and more specifically, you know, maybe step through on that right foot and lift that left knee. Let it square your hips and shoulders. Here, she's really not squared or a target. Again, she rebounds, it really didn't time it or move, just kind of slides over. Again, not the footwork we're looking for. Kind of swings or hooks the ball up or lifts the ball up. Again, not a lot of control coming off. We've got to use that non-shooting hand. Point of emphasis here. We've got to get that non-shooting hand on the ball to help stabilize it before the shot. Here's the, she kind of throws it up there, lifts it, swings it up there. And see, no real footwork here or not getting off the ground. Again, not the ideal footwork here we're looking for in the Mike and Gerald. Here's the shot. It hits the bottom of the backboard. Again, it's just because it comes off this left hand, not a lot of control, sense of direction here. And again, no real footwork is not there. The spacing's not there to probably complete this to get the result you want. Again, much better attempt here. I'd love to see her go off this left foot on the right side, but she does get a better angle here. You can see the extension of the right arm. Ball might hit a little lower on the box there and hit the rim. The snap, that follow-through down, but she is in a better angle here, much improved from the last two shots. Again, left side, again, just kind of walks over, not the footwork you're wanting to see. I love to see her push off the right foot and pull that left leg up. Again, really tough angle here. I mean, it starts with angles. Basketball is a game of angles and being in a spacing and being in a position to make yourself successful. And again, that ball is sitting in that left palm, I'm sure, right here. No real utilization of the non-shooting hand to help support the ball as it's lifted. Here's the, just basically just lifting it and throwing it up if you will. We want to get our shooting hand more behind the ball, get that guide hand here on the side. We need to get our weight more centered. Here it's all shifted here to the right. Again, see how she dips it? She's just kind of pushing the ball up, lifting it. I don't even know what to call it. It's just not ideal shooting form. It's just not being real strong with the ball. We need that right hand on the ball. We need our weight evenly distributed, be a little more fundamental as we square our body to our target here. Here, see how she dips it? Again, I mean, it's just loosely wobbly on that hand. Again, in a game, a defender's going to strip that. It's a turnover kind of looking to happen here. She would benefit more, just she's got to get two hands on the ball to bring it up. She's going to be stronger with it. She's just not real strong here with the basketball. She does look up. She's trying really hard to find her target. Here see that ball dipping down again here's defense they're gonna strip that ball away. Here the shooter is attempting a right-hand layup. I think the first thing I would want to say about this is, you know, she's just standing underneath the basket. So one, she doesn't really have the proper angle to have her whole body, hips, shoulders, square to her target. So she's having to like sweep it up or lift the ball up with one hand. All that weight kind of goes on the right foot. Again, just not the proper spacing and angle and footwork here on the right side. Again, lets it drop, shifts her weight, kind of lifts the ball if you will. Again, not the spacing angle we want. See the palm of the hand is kind of lifting the ball. Just doesn't have a lot of control and accuracy here. Got to get our weight shifted, be more balanced. She would benefit from just working on the footwork all by itself from the mic and then add the ball, then add the shot. Again, not the ideal transition from left to right on the mic. And again, it starts with spacing and the footwork of getting your body in a position to hit the backboard. Here, we're a little bit too straight on. Again, ideally, I'd love to see her step through with this left foot and pull the right leg up. You put that left hand on the ball and shoot it. Bring it up with two hands here. You're just not in a really position to be successful. The ball's going to be wobbly, out of control. It's not stable as it leaves that hand. Again, you know, she would benefit from getting a better foot spacing here and maybe moving her body to the right. But she's really dipping this right shoulder, sticking the ball in the right palm of the hand to shoot this right layup. All the weight shifts to that right side. Again, you know, she needs to probably be over here a little bit more. This is a tough angle right here to finish off the top of the square. Here's the lift. Again, not ideal shooting form. We want to square our shoulders, put this right shooting hand behind the ball, put the non-shooting left hand on the side to help guide it up. Let's not try to lean here to our right, but step through and square our shoulders and hips to our target. Again, just not getting her body in a position here. The angle that we're looking for, she's a little bit too far under the basket. Got that ball in a very vulnerable position here. Assume it's sitting on the left palm of the hand. She doesn't utilize this non-shooting hand to help support it on the side. And again, not really the footwork we want to see for the Mike. Again, she's just basically got her both her feet side by side, maybe leans a little bit on the left. And then, you know, she kind of basically just slides over, not really the angle you're looking for to hit this top of the square. So again, the ball just sitting now in her left palm of her hand, no real use of that offhand, the non-shooting hand to help support the ball. So important because, you know, the ball's leaving this hand. It just wasn't stable to begin with. So you have no control where it's going to go from this point.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Let's spread our feet here again. I love how, you know, maybe she is right-handed. Let's, you know, she's got that right arm at a 90 degree, but I'd love to see this right hand behind the basketball, that left hand possibly on the side. Here again, this left hand kind of makes its way around the basketball. You know, we got to get that. I think she's a right-handed shooter. We just got to get this left elbow in so that and then when you do that it kind of makes the hand come around. Good knee bend, good dropping of the hips. She does that very well. Here's the release, maybe a little bit too much arc here, a little too much of a rainbow here, maybe take a little bit of this off, and again that big step forward we want to jump up and come straight down. Again, ideally, let's be a ready shooter. We're a little straight up here, locked knees. I'd love to see her bend her knees more, get one foot in front of the other. She is doing a good job of reaching her hands out to catch the basketball, which is good to see. But let's go meet this pass. Let's drop our hips and step into this pass and meet it and try to, and again, it takes practice and she would really benefit from just working on some form shooting. Here's the shot. Again, really two hands shooting the basketball. Ideally, we want to shoot with one, you know, she's extended both arms out. Ideally, we want one shooting hand and arm extended, the other more at a 90 degree. She's really having to step forward to get the ball to the rim. You know, and ideally in this shooting drill, I would want my shooter to be in a more ready position to receive this pass. I'm trying to see where the ball is. It's somewhere in there, or maybe here it is. See how she's standing straight up. You know, we wanna bend our knees, get one leg foot in front of the other, drop our hips and really step in and meet this pass. That also, you know, gives you more power in the use of this lower body. Here's the ball right here. But, you know, she needs to go get this pass and step into it and shoot it. That's what this drill would be all about. She's really not what I consider a ready, aggressive shooter. So it looks like she's, you know, shooting with two hands, and you can see it right here, and in the ego view. So I don't know if she's right-handed or left-handed, to be honest with you, but ideally you want to get one, designate a shooting hand behind the ball, and the other non-shooting hand would be your guide hand, which would be on the side of the ball. Here she followed through with both arms, both hands, and you know, she's having to really, you know, shoot with two hands because she's not getting a lot of leg work here. She's kind of standing straight up. I do see a little jumping here, and her jumping, though, is taking her forward instead of straight up. So ideally we want to be more vertical on her takeoff and then on her landing. And we've got to designate one hand as our shooting hand. Again, here's our landing. A lot of weight here on that left knee. It looks like the feet kind of turn inward. We want to keep our hips square, our feet square to the basket. Hold that follow-through up. Again, here's the landing, really locks out those knees. Let's bend those knees, have a softer landing, more balance, get our feet really under our body. And she also brings both arms back. You know, let's hold this follow through. Let's keep it up there, stay with the shot. And here it looks like it's gonna hit left here. And it's cause she's shooting with two hands. It's just kind of putting some funky spin on the ball and it just throwing off the accuracy of the pathway that the ball needs to go to go in. Here's the shot. She, you know, she does drop her hips, um, spread those feet. She does bend her knees, which is really good to see. I'm not sure what this left hand is doing here. It's, it's probably moving on the ball, so you don't want any extra movement with your, when your hands are on the ball. That's why you want to catch it like you want to shoot it. I love her vision takes her over the top of the ball as she's looking at the rim. Again, I'm trying to get this view over here a little bit better so I can see the hands, but she's shooting with both hands. It's just definitely probably causing this ball to spin sideways instead of that nice backspin we like to see. And again, that big step forward is tough to do when you're being guarded in a game situation. You're not going to be able to take that step forward because there's going to be a defender there. Again, takes that big step forward, follow through goes down, let's keep it up a little bit. Here's the arc, maybe a little bit too much arc, but I'd rather have too much arc than it be shot real flat. Let's have more of a balanced landing. Again, I would really recommend her working in, possibly even do what I call partner shooting, when you just shoot across from one another. Even, let's take off the idea that the ball's got to go in the basket. Just have one person stand here, one person stand here, and you just shoot across from one another. Just working on that form and technique. Again, I love, you know, it looks like that right hand is at 90, you know, the arm is 90 degree with the hand, the ball sitting right there on the right hand. I didn't get a good look here, but that guide hand is kind of making its way around to the behind the ball as well. Again, throwing off the accuracy and the rotation spin that you look for in a shot. Again, takes a big step here with the one foot. We love to for you to jump straight up and come straight down. A lot of that weight's over that, looks like the left knee. Again, that's a lot of weight to be on, for one knee to take on the landing. We want it to be more evenly distributed here. And let's figure out here, if we're right-handed, again, let's start in tight, work on that forearm. Again, this looks good here. I just think it's the second hand or the left hand that makes its way around, causing an elbow to pop out. Again, you know, she doesn't have a lot of power here. It's hard to jump when you both your feet are together. You know, you get more leverage, more power, strength when you can spread those feet and have more of a push-off there. That's why she's got to pull that left hand around to help lift the ball up. So what would help is to get more legs involved in the shot. And you know, again, she catches it, pauses, aims. Again, in a game-like situation, you know, she would never get her shot off because she would be easily defended. But as you notice here in this ego view, see how this, and again, I don't really know if she's a right-handed or left-handed shooter. This hand's starting to kind of move on top of the basketball. So then you're gonna have this real funky spin, if you will. You could see this left hand kind of going on the top. Again, I honestly can't tell if she's a right-handed or left-handed. So that would be the first thing we would need to try to figure out here. You know, I would really recommend her moving in here really close and just shooting, working on her form. Form shooting, really in tight. No dribble, no jumping, just some stationary form shooting. And see how her feet are really apart. Not real balanced and stable here. Let's spread them apart. Let's kind of spread the weight of our body across both feet. Here's the shot. Again, kind of just really pushing the ball out with both hands. Again, stepping forward. We'd love to see her be more vertical and balanced here. But really good. She's got the right idea in terms of getting the ball up high. The ball's got to go up to be able to go in. Again, the feet are really close as she begins to go up into her shot. I like this elbow 90 degrees. She's got her eyes up. Here the shooter is shooting a 15-footer from the free throw line to the basket. Here what I would want to talk about is how her feet are really close together. You know, I don't, it looks like she's a right-hand shooter, then her right foot would need to be slightly in front, left foot behind, shoulder width apart. I love how she's bending her knees though, that's really nice, and dropping those hips. She's looking over the ball, which is where you want to look. Again, it looks really good in this, in this image. I can't really see where her hands are here in this, this stoppage, but let's continue. And here she dribbles it. In this drill you really have no time to dribble it. It's a catch-and-shoot type situation. And again see how her head you can see the eyes drop down to look at the ball. When you do that you take your eyes off the rim. Again, follow through with both hands. Let's say she's right-handed, we got to take this left hand out of the shot. See how both arms are extended. She's got good arc on it. I will give her that. And again, see the landing, a little weight forward off balance. You know, we want to land with our weight evenly distributed on both feet. Again, she starts, see she's kind of like having to heave it up there, push it up there, which is not ideal. It's just going to throw off the accuracy of the ball going to the, to the hoop. Here comes the pass. Again, you know, this is really important to note, you know, she catches it with both hands on the side of the ball. You know, ideally, if she is a right-handed shooter, she's going to catch this ball with this shooting hand behind the ball, the guide hand here on the side, and then you're ready to, your hands are where you want it to be in terms of placement on the basketball. And this is maybe why she's shooting with two hands. She's catching it with both hands on the side. Again, straight up. We need to get in a lower body position, spread our feet, be more balanced. Here's the landing. You see how both arms kind of fall back. We'd like to keep that shooting arm extended out till the ball hits something up here. Again, let's drop our knees, bend them, soft landing. It looks like even our feet are maybe turned to the right. We want to square our hips, our knees, everything to the basket. So you can see how she lands. Here's the shot. She doesn't hold a follow-through. Both arms go down. And see how she lands with one leg really in front of the other. Again, ideally you want to land, and she kind of fell forward I should say, you want to go straight up and come straight down. It's tough because you're being guarded in a game and you can't fall into that defender. But she's got really good arc on the ball. It looks like it's gonna be a little off to the right here. Eyes on target. Good to see. Again, let's get these feet apart, good knee bend, dropping of the hips. Love how she's looking up over the basketball here. Looks like that right arm is at 90 degree, which is good to get that, so that ball kind of sits back on that shooting hand, if that's her shooting hand. you", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This left leg is kind of, seems like it's losing tension, kind of flopping away from the wall, which seems to be churning out her hips. So she'll probably want to kind of flag out and keep a little bit more tension with that left foot. But overall she's kind of transitioning, moving to the right to really get below this left hand. You know, she's opposite post, she's got right foot on, left hand on. And the right hand is still keeping a lot of tension. So you can see her looking up, really observing the route where she's going. So that way when she gets there, you know, it's not really a surprise. So she's really like, it seems like she's really observing the route and trying to figure it all out while on the ground to have the best idea of how to climb through it. And for whatever reason, she decides to backtrack this move and go back down to the start, but is not able to hold the swing back down and ultimately falls off the wall. You can see she's starting, keeping her arms nice and straight, their tension, but they're not overly pulling. So that way she'll be able to kind of sink down low and really drive into her feet and toes. It looks like she's moving up and right, so I'm assuming she'll probably move her right hand up in this area. So she probably could twist a little bit more and get this right hip into the wall, just a little bit more.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

As the dancer performs a turn that locomotes her through the space, she's able to do so quickly and efficiently and with stability, particularly thanks to the spotting of her head.

Would love to see more lift here. Great job with getting the eyes and head up.

His feet are close together. Let's get a wider base here. Again, kind of moves side to side slowly, very little explosiveness or lift here, shoots over that left shoulder. We'd love to see him square this shoulder a little bit more and face the basket. He's really having to cover a lot of area here. Let's get a little closer. Again, moves to the right side, same thing here. Very little push-off, explosiveness with that point, that right hip up. He does have two hands on the ball, which offers better control, better stability, better execution for getting the ball up to be released. Again, the shooter gets the ball out of the net, lets it drop down a little bit too low. In this drill, the Mike could draw, I'd love for him to keep it up higher. So instead of having your arms down, let's get the arms up above your forehead, above your head, to catch it and keep it there as you move to the second side. He uses the correct footwork, crosses it over with his right foot, followed by his left, and I love that his eyes and head are up, looking at the target. Here, he kind of shoots it over his right shoulder. We'd love to see that shooting arm be more following that path of the ball to the basket here. It's like kind of, you could tell he went, he went like that to shoot it. Let's get it more straight onto the basket. I would love to see him maybe shoot the ball more out in front of his left chest. He kind of wraps it around his left shoulder, if you will. And again, there's no lift at all. He's flat-footed here. Legs are locked out. You know, this is what I don't consider this game speed. If we want to make it relative to a game situation, he's going to have to go a lot harder and be more aggressive. But good lift here with the shooting arm, good breaking of the wrists on the follow-through. Here's the follow-through. It kind of comes across his body a little bit. You can see here, we love to have that follow-through, that arm be straight to the basketball, like actually following the ball into the net. But you can see, and this is why I give him the score, he just doesn't explode. He doesn't really lift this left leg up, this left hip up to give him some power and aggression, aggressiveness here. He's just kind of going through the motions, if you will, and would love to see him do this, what I call it, more in a game speed. Love that he uses his left hand on the left side. Would love to keep this guide hand up a little higher and have it in the picture here in the egocentric view.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So in this position the climber is hanging on with a right hand here. And he is utilizing a low left foot. It's kind of hard to see exactly what's going on with his right foot. But what the climber is trying to do here is he is allowing his left knee to be turned over to the right. What this does is it helps to apply pressure on that left leg. While the climber also allows his right arm to be in a flexed position. So that he can keep his shoulder nice and stable and use it as a pivot point so he can rotate around it. So this does use up a lot of energy very quickly. And one thing that I can tell is as the climber grabs onto that left hand. We can kind of almost see his head kind of shoot backwards. And so that kind of tells me that the climber is relying a lot on what's going on with his upper body to complete this movement. And so as he moves up with that left hand. It's a lot of body weight for him to maintain on his right arm. So as soon as he grabs onto that left hand it's kind of the only reason why he's able to stay on the wall. So it does kind of show a little bit of a lack of control. Especially in his movement. Because it does rely so much on how much power he's generating with his right arm. And so here we can see the clamber was able to bring his right hand over onto this yellow hold so he's now matched on it. So what the clamber ended up doing is that with his right foot on this foot hold here, he did push his right foot so that his body weight transitioned over to the left. And by doing that, this does place him directly underneath his left arm so that he does not experience any weight shifting as he moves up his right arm. So this is a really good position to see, especially because both of his arms are in a very straight position. So this is a much better demonstration of how to have more control in your movement.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Well played. really nice bow use here. You can see how beautifully straight this bow is, which creates a parallel perpendicular line that has a 90-degree angle on each side of the string and bow, making a perfect box. Beautifully in tune. Good bowing, nice phrasing. You can see a really good use of the bow hand here, where every single beginning of the stroke has a tiny bit of energy increase in the finger here. That energy is necessary to create a bite in the string with the bow in the middle. And you can see that it's just the finger engagement with a little bit of wrist motion coming this direction. And that is indicative of a good player who makes a good sound. really clean shift here you can see that movement up the instrument was really smooth really clean and really efficient A little slow here could be faster compared to the tempo just played in the previous melody. Excellent shift, very in tune. Really good hand use here on the left side of the musician. You can see how the vibrato and the first finger are in sync and the open palm here shows that they know how to vibrate clean and clearly and then they move their palm further this direction to help get the fingers back on the fingerboard. Really nice slur from the D to the A string. Good posture to start. This foot is a little far back. I would have this foot also straight. It's possible they're doing this to make the E string of the violin more easily accessible with the bow and not have to bang their leg when they're using that string. Instrument placement looks really good straight off of the shoulder and head and neck and shoulders are aligned like a normal sitting position. Left hand also looks really good. Elbow is underneath the instrument. Nice curved fingers. Thumb looks to be in a good place. At the tail end here, wrist comes in, thumb pops up. Wrist needs to stay out and the thumb needs to stay down. Excellent consistency with this etude. The importance is the regularity of each type of note. All of the bumps need to have the same kind of length and the ba-da-da need to have a similar sound when they're each at the end of the bow. Really nice transition between the first melody section and this deeper melody. Tempo did slow down just slightly. Keep the tempo up here. The best part about the shift there is they're shifting on the old string and then placing their finger on the new string and then moving the bow. It's very clean and very nice to listen to. Ball hold looks really, really nice. You can see curved pinky right on top and an excellent use of the first hanger curled over the stick here.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They can try to focus on a little bit of hand weight but more finger action so that they're able to get more clarity and a more stable tempo. Again, when they're playing this repeated note, it starts to feel less consistent rhythmically. It's a lot for them just to do with one finger. They can try to alternate between fingers or even just try a different fingering from here and there so that they can give one of their fingers a break. Playing these repeated notes as the piece goes on, they're becoming less clear as we're going on. I think it's because of them playing with their flatter fingers. They could also try a different fingering with this. Instead of using just one finger, try to alternate between two so it's not so taxing on one finger. The pianist has their middle fingers raised up while playing this, which is causing some unneeded tension in the hand. You should make sure that they have them just a little bit more relaxed and they can help with the downward motion to help the other fingers. Again, throughout this piece they've been using a lot of hand motion just to get their fingers into the keyboard. If they can try to maybe have a little bit more typing motion for some of this faster stuff it would feel more efficient for them and it would be more clear. They lose a little bit of clarity here for how fast they're trying to play. They could try to keep their hands closer to the fingerboard to have more control at a tempo like this, or possibly just slow it down and prioritize accuracy. The pianist is getting a lot of weight into the keys because they're using their forearms. This is really good for the character of the piece. The pianist is using their thumb to play this note repeatedly over and over. The pianist is getting a lot of power throughout this whole piece. They're doing a really excellent job of getting a lot of weight into the keyboard with their hands. I still think they can find a balance though with the faster stuff to try to utilize some of their fingers also so that they have more variety in their playing. Piazza is able to get some really excellent articulation here in the right hand, so using a lot of weight into the keyboard. The pianist has a tendency to always rush a little bit ahead. It always feels like it's on the edge rhythmically. It'd be good for them just to slow it down, practice so they feel like they have much more control. Even taking a slightly slower tempo and playing very accurately would come across as being more impressive. The pianists could get a little bit more articulation if they brought more weight from their arm down and got a little bit closer to the key. Right now it seems like they're playing kind of superficially on the top so they're not getting as much articulation as they could.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So here when he changes to the next position where he crosses over, he does pause a bit with his feet but he does a good job keeping his arms rotating as that kind of pause happens with the cross. A really nice job stepping out and crossing fully across his body for this part. The dancer starts stepping in place. He does a good job getting his feet slightly off the floor. He's light on his feet. His knees can bend just a little bit more. But really nice rotation in the arms and back. So here when he turns, they're really smooth but not as a sharp whipping turn as one might normally do. So maybe you want to just be able to spot that head. I do notice with his dancer he's a little stiff from his head to his shoulders so you really want to loosen up the whole body not just from your really arms down to your feet. So really thinking about your full, your neck, all of that stuff has to translate with movement in the music. Same thing with the front and back. Again, I think he could go up on his toes a little bit. His feet are a little flat stepping forward and back, so really want to articulate those feet to have a little level change. So here when he steps out to the side, nice spacing in between the legs. This foot that is out to the side, the left foot, the heel could be off the floor just a bit. But his knees are slightly bent and he does give a little push to the side with his upper body as he steps out. So it's a nice change in energy from stepping in place.

You gotta jump. You gotta get off the ground here. Let's hold this follow-through. Ball's in a good position here, though, to go in. Again, you know, a lot of his weights here on the left foot, push off, love that his feet are apart, pretty good extension here, nice follow through. Again, you know, he's kind of a lot of weight on his right leg. You could see him kind of lean in here a little bit to the right. Good extension here off the pads of those fingers. I love that you could see the guide hand in the picture here. Again, right side layup, he's choosing to go off two feet, which is fine. Ideally though, the Mike and Drew, we love the one foot takeoff. Here though, the power layup, the two foot takeoff does offer good balance here and he does a nice job. Great extension here of the shooting right arm. Here he starts to pull the ball up. I like that his feet are still apart, his knees are bent, and his eyes and head are up. Here's the guide hand, you know, we'd love for it to be a little bit higher, maybe, maybe to take it up and then you keep it up there a little higher, maybe right in here. If there was like a, you know, a defender coming over, you want that arm bar to protect the ball. But great extension here at the left elbow, you see the ball come off the pads of those fingers. So, you've got really good spacing here to use that top of the back square on the backboard. Here a better takeoff here. He's got his feet spread apart, which is fine. You know, I would love to see, ideally, the footwork for this is off the right foot and pull that left knee up. But if he's going to power it up off two feet, you know, let's really get some lift and aggression here. Good lift here. He's really extended that left elbow. That's a great job. See the ball come off the pads of those fingers. He's right on target here to use the backboard. I like that he's got his feet spread apart. Would love to see him a little bit more square by bringing this left leg in a little bit more, kind of shooting over that left shoulder. Here's the follow-through. He drops it. Let's keep it up there. Keep it extended. Let's have a really nice balanced landing. I love that his eyes and head are up. Again, he does get it out of the neck quickly and gets to this left side. Again, we'd love to see more lift and power here. If he's going to go off two feet, let's really power it up. Ideally, though, just the motion, the movement of this drill is side to side, is the step through footwork, power, you know, off one leg, drive that left opposite knee up. Here the shooter is shooting a right-hand layup. He kind of shoots it underhand and kind of just tosses it up. So I would love to see him get that shooting hand behind the ball and really elevate using either a two-foot real push-off or to really drive, push off that left foot and pull that right knee up. But not bad extension here and great use of the backboard. Ideally, I would love to see him, you know, just work on his footwork without shooting the basketball. Just, you know, stepping on the right, pulling the left, stepping with the left, pulling the right up, just back and forth, back and forth. Here he just kind of shuffles over. He's leaning to his left here, dropping that left shoulder. And then, you know, that, therefore, he's beginning his shot down here. Let's use the feet and the footwork to get our body square so we can really lift that ball up quickly. Again, just kind of moving from side to side off two feet. Ideally, I would love on the left side to plant this right foot, square your body by driving the left knee up. Great extension here, though. Great. Got his arm bar up. Would love it a little bit higher, but good. Love that his eyesight is focused on that backboard. Here's the release. Great target hit right here at the top of that square. Love to see more power and lift here. I think he can jump higher. Let's hold that follow-through. Much better job here of the arm bar up higher and bent. And in this drill, ideally, you want to get the ball out of the net and keep it up high. He drops it down really low here. And the reason you want to, this is a rebounding drill as well, you want to keep it up high so the little defenders don't steal it. So when you bring it down here, you make yourself smaller and more vulnerable. He does a really good job of keeping his eyes up, his head up. He's got his feet apart. If he chooses to go off two feet, let's really use these two legs to really push ourself up off the ground. Here he moves to the left side, you know, ideally in this drill, the Mike and drill, you love to see him get that rebound and then step through with the right foot and really pull this left knee up, but he's just choosing to kind of slide from side to side. We just love to see more push off and aggression here. He does a really good job of keeping his eyes up on his target and getting to a place where he can use the backboard. Getting ready to shoot here, would love that guide hand, that right hand to stay a little bit longer on the ball, but he's doing a good job of lifting the ball up here for the shot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

In this case, the climber's arms were really crossed over and making the footwork and everything that he's center of gravity was out of his base of support. So even though the climber has made it to the top hold, it's important that the climber is able to engage the core to transfer over the weight on the feet. The climber could potentially make another attempt on this one if he was to make the hand placement, the left hand to the left grip and the right hand onto the right grip and potentially would have an easier time going out to the higher hold being the pocket. Here the climber has made the commitment to reach up to the hold, was able to place the fingers but unsure as he was able to apply the right pressure as this was a quick move. He let go of the left foot and instead is pointed out as a flag, keeping all of the pressure on the stance for the right foot that's placed the highest. It's important that the climber knows how to manage his body, which he does well by sending his shoulders out left. Now the center of gravity is mostly on the core and the hips of the climber, so it's important that he transfers that weight over to the highest foot. And he needs to send himself over to the left not only to help the reach that is already going up left while he's gaining leverage, but also for the left hand grip as it needs to be applied that sufficient pressure when going on that direction. The climber here is starting at two hand hold start. So each hand has its own hold. The left hand is positioned to the right side being crossed over the right hand that's over on the left side. Now each hand has a different grip. So for the left hand, the climber is placing it on a block that could be held like a pinch. So the climber sends the fingers over to the far side and keeps the thumb on the inside creating a clamping position. And for the right hand, since it's underneath, there is a small chip with a very small edge. So the climber is holding this as a crimp and the climber is digging in the finger digits between the wall and the hold. As we can see, the knuckles are sticking out and the thumb is being placed to support that grip. This is a very advanced hold to sustain. So it's important that the climber creates pressure by leaning on that hold. Now it's important also the direction of where the climber is leaning as he would have to keep the arm extended for the left hand and pushing away on the opposite direction of how it's been gripped. Here we can hear the thump of the foot slip onto the ground. When the climber touches the ground, then the climb is over. This is before the right hand came to release. Here, the climber has already placed the feet on the wall. And so once the feet are off the mat, then the climb will start. Since the climber was having the right hand underneath the left hand, it was not ideal for him to be positioned that way, as he will need the right hand to go up for the reach. So he repositions the right hand to be above the left hand. And as we can see, he is holding on to that crimp. At this moment, almost leaving in order to go up for the next move.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Yeah, all looks good so far. Yeah, a two. I mean, he had really no gauge to his power, so he's kind of just throwing it off the backboard and hoping for a bank. So on the catch he has no footwork into the catch like a one-two or a hop. No rhythm going into the catch but he is shoulder width apart. His feet. Yeah, he's really struggling. It's going off the backboard without even hitting the rim right now. I'd say it too On the left, the follow through though, you can see this is more of a push shot and less of like a wrist snap. So the follow through is a little funky. And on the right you can see he has no jump or really like lift up onto his toes going into his jump shot. It's all arm.

Now it looks like she's first trying to kind of get a stone in, which probably isn't the best move, but you can see if you look at her feet, she's keeping a lot of tension, almost dropping her knee in, which is shifting her weight to the left more. So if this is paired with her standing through that right foot, it should be what gets her up and left. She would just have to switch this hand around to kind of be palms up. So she's kind of grabbing on the underside of this hold. She does end up going palms up so this is the correct form on this hold. So now what she needs to do is she needs to kind of get above it and that's all going to come from her feet. So her left foot is good and planted, she's got to really extend off this right foot to stay opposite opposed and balanced.

His movements around himself are separating his legs and his feet more significantly, which is causing him to move slower and also with less clarity. He would benefit from maintaining the small and more precise movements that he had in his lower body more towards the beginning of the performance. As the dancer continues the basic salsa step now moving around himself to change facings in the room, he alternates lifting his arms over his head. However, this arm choreography is really disjointed from the rhythm of the music and his positioning of his arm overhead also could use some clarity. You can see his hand is creating kind of an awkward thumb out position where he could use some more attention to detail and shaping in the arm and the hand overall. He could also benefit from providing more clarity of his rhythmic embodiment through the choreography of this arm. As the dancer begins with a basic step touch of the feet moving side to side, he's got a lot of looseness in his upper body which is not necessarily connected to the rhythm or helping him connect to the rhythm in any way. His arm choreography appears quite loose and disjointed as well as the use of his head which is significantly floating side to side and is really disconnected from the rhythm overall. In general he could use some refinement in the upper body. While the dancer is continuing to struggle with an overall looseness in his upper body that's disconnected from the rhythm, he maintains a solid rhythm with this basic salsa step in his feet through this alternating step touch movement. You can actually audibly hear his feet performing this movement and you can hear that he is connected to the rhythm. As the dancer continues into a basic salsa step, continuing to move side to side, the disjointment that's happening in the upper body is persisting, but he also has this looseness in the hips where he's really pushing the weight in one direction or the other, which is actually quite contradictory to what's happening in his lower body where the weight is being pushed in the opposite direction. Overall, this is creating an awkward shape for him to move through, which is causing him to disconnect from the rhythm because he's not able to move as quickly and as precisely as the rhythm might demand, and also is mirroring the kind of looseness and lack of clarity that's happening in the upper body.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This is exactly where they should be playing, and we can hear that the note envelope is very consistent and that it's very controlled, and that it also allows the rhythm to be stable. So this is exactly how you should play these light, short, spiccato notes. This allows the character to be very solid, but very upbeat. We hear that the notes being played on the high string have a bit of a tinnier quality to them, a bit of a scratch to them. This is because they are not using enough weight and they're using too fast of a bow speed, so the bow is somewhat skating on top of the string instead of always having good contact with the string, and that skating on top is giving us that tinny, scratchy quality. So ideally they would slow the bow down and get a little bit more contact with the string so that they get a clear articulation and tone on each note. The left hand and the right hand are not in sync here. We would like to hear more distinct voices in this section. So when they're playing on the higher strings, bring those out a little bit more. Then when they just do the repeated notes on the C string, play those either a little bit lighter or with a little bit different vibrato. Trying to contrast these two voices instead of it just sounding like a long line of notes. That would be the best musical thing to do in this situation. This is too fast of a bow speed to be playing this melody with. They need to use a slower bow speed with a little bit more weight near the bridge instead of a fast bow speed. We can hear the bow moving quickly because of how each bow change has a little bit more bite to it. So for this to sound more vocal and more pleasing, we want a slower, more controlled bow speed, but with the appropriate amount of weight and not the right placement to where we still had a forte volume. These three notes just played as pickups, came out as not a lot of core tone and not a consistent clean articulation on the top of it. This is because the violinist is not putting enough weight through pronation into their first finger to get the appropriate amount of weight needed to play at a moderately loud dynamic at the tip. So since we're so far away from the right hand when we're at the tip, we have to adjust by putting more weight into the fingertip. This is going to make it easier to get a clean articulation on every note as well as a beautiful core tone. This open string really stands out in the texture of what has already been played. This is because it's open, there can't be vibrato on it, and then also this, that open strings have a different color than closed strings. So this note really stands out, which is not musically pleasing. So the best thing to do would be to play this, obviously same note and same pitch, on another string, a lower string where it can be closed and vibrated so that it would fit into the musical context better. We would like to hear on this last bow played a little bit more of a swell and then taper of volume. This is a suspension harmonically and it's held out for the whole measure. And so to highlight that musically and to make the most interesting moment, we would want to swell to the middle of the bow and then taper and then release the suspension into this next note very gently. And that's going to give us a really beautiful gesture. This is just kind of played flat dynamically and so it wasn't super pleasing to listen to. These top notes being played are coming out as very weak with not a lot of core tone because the player is not playing close enough to the bridge. As they move up the string, they have to also move the bow closer to the bridge in order to have a consistency of tone. We're seeing a lot of extraneous movement in the left hand, and this is contributing to the fingers of the left hand and the bow not being in sync, which is why we can hear a lack of clarity between the notes. So the player really needs to make sure they are not extraneously raising up fingers, especially fourth finger in the left hand, so they can have more control in between each note. On the repeated down bows, as well as the repeated up bows, we're not hearing a stop in the sound. We need to actually hear a little bit of silence in between each of these repeated down bows so that we know that they're separate notes. Right now we just hear a pulsing of weight and not an actual clear separation of notes. So this can be done by both releasing the weight in the first finger and stopping or greatly slowing down the bow in between these down bows so that we hear that these are actually different notes being played. This last note played on an up bow here popped out as more accented and more aggressive than the notes played in the rest of this piece. We don't want that to happen. What we want when we're ending a piece, especially a piece of a classical nature like this, is to end on a very smooth and calm released note, not jab out that note. They should be playing this on a down bow, not an up bow, so that they can get a really smooth start to it. It's a lot more difficult to do that on an up bow. On the up bow, it's an unnatural decrescendo because they're moving toward the weight of the frog. Whereas if they were on the down bow here, they could just pull the down bow to the right, not have to do anything in terms of pronation, and just let the natural taper of the bow take care of the musical taper that needs to happen. We're getting a lot of slightly too harsh articulation on the beginnings of these notes. That's because the player is too far out in the bow for this. There's no reason to not be closer to the frog right now. And if they were closer to the frog, they would be able to have a more natural articulation because they wouldn't be having to press or pronate to get the weight in. So unless we need to be out further in the bow, we should try to remain closer to the balance point, or at least in the middle third, so that we can have a more natural sounding, softer articulation, but with the required weight to put out a nice forte sound. The player is using an open string on a sustained note here and it's really popping out because it has no vibrato and a slightly tinier tone than a closed note. So they really need to find a fingering where they can play this note on a lower string but closed so that it does not pop out of the musical texture here. We're hearing an inconsistency of the length of the first note on every bow stroke. This is because the down bows are being played with more weight and the up bows are being played with more speed. So what we're hearing is kind of heavier notes on the down bow and then a more poked out, kind of slightly more aggressive note on the up bow. It would help to be a little bit further out in the bow, maybe around here just for consistency. But also just making sure that we're using the same amount of weight and speed on each one of these figures here, on each bow stroke. The player has drifted too far out towards the tip, as we can see. Now they're playing in the upper third, where ideally they want to be down here, and they are attempting to move their bow back to that location. But instead of moving it during rests, they're expending more bow on certain notes so that they can get back to where they want to be. And the negative result of this is that some notes are popping out more than others because they are using too much bow on that. So what we would have to do here is use the time during the rests to adjust a little bit if we find ourselves in the wrong part of the bow so that we don't sacrifice a consistent note envelope. We can hear a good, quick vibrato even on these short notes at the end of each little figure. And that gives a lot of energy to the piece and gives it a nice, light character. So it's a beautifully finessed way to play this line. This is what we want to see. Just a note that this is being played on viola, violin music on viola, but the commentary will be directed toward playing on the violin, which is very similar technical language as the viola. The ritardando that the player just executed was not quite slow enough, not quite drastic enough. It's really important when we add a ritardando in that we do enough of a ritardando for it to be clear to the listener that that is what's happening. In this instance, it wasn't very clear and it just made the listener question, are they losing tempo? So they need to exaggerate that more in order to have the correct musical effect. The notes played on the highest string, the E string, on the up bow sounded rushed and not as full as the other notes. This is because, as we can see, the bow is at a little bit of an angle, which isn't great, but also the bow is more over the fingerboard than it is close to the bridge. These notes are on the high string, and they're close to the bridge, therefore we have to be in a bow placement that is closer to the bridge. That will allow us to not rush through them because there will be more resistance on the string. We can more easily move the bow slowly while getting a loud sound, which is what we want because this is a musically important moment. So to get the ideal sound here, lower placement, a little bit slower speed, that'll give us correct rhythm and good resonance. This note should have immediate vibrato instead of a delayed and then quick vibrato on the end. Musically it needs immediate and vocal sounding vibrato.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Just a lot of unpredictability with these ones. If the connection is made slightly lower just because of the shape of the foot plus the lean back in the stance, this ball can literally go anywhere. So it's just not something I would recommend technique wise. Again I'd prefer to see that toe pointing up. And trying to get around the top of the ball almost to ensure that we're keeping it down. Also less of a lean back in the stance because that's going to add fuel to the fire if we do connect with the ball lower down. That lean back is going to add extra height and a higher angle in the trajectory overall. Just stance overall in this passing, lean back too often, too consistently. And just the shape of the foot upon connection. A little bit on the risky side. So one thing the player is doing well at is consistently making a connection with an appropriate part of the ball and the appropriate part of the ball here to keep the shot down is probably closer to that central line. Central kind of, if we draw a line through a circle, just hitting that central line and not hitting the bottom half of the ball, the further down the connection is made it's going to go higher, it's going to bobble. So even though the player is leaning back a lot, we're seeing very flat passes and again this is due to the player making consistent connections with the centre line and not slipping the foot under the ball causing it to bobble up and go high. Again, more of a passing stance, flat foot in, we're up, very leaned back, very leaned back here in the upper body, and then also with the head down, potentially you want to see this point brought in a little bit so we can see a more straight up head, and then less of a leaned back body, and also the hips brought slightly forward here. As we can see what the player is doing here is generating that forward spin on the pass, trying to hit the ball in an upwards motion, but also keeping it flat, so just giving it that extra bit of forward spin to get it into the target's hands with that extra bit of speed. So seeing pretty consistent Opening out of both feet when connecting with the ball Depending on the foot. So here the left foot being opened out very early and ankle is locked in this kind of position the toe is not being dragged across the body and The foot is not being dragged across the body. So kind of accurate push passes into the hands here And Yeah, just good control overall with with like the passing even though it's a moving ball however If we are trying to keep it down if we're going with longer passes, I feel like a small bit of a better technique would be to try and actually Get this foot more upwards and to try connect with the ball with more of a straight leg and That way again if we bring this Foot kind of upwards with a toe being pointed up it's going to help us actually get around the top of the ball and Push it into the ground more creating that spin and just create more of a flat rolling pass in Versus one that has bobbles and could ultimately take a little hop up into the sky if we connect with the wrong part of the ball because our foot is pointing down the way And here we see a little bit of a inaccurate connection compared to the last ones. We can see foot connecting below that centre point on the ball. So this one is going to get a lift. And we see it just kind of coming up and still kind of a comfortable catch but just a little bit of inconsistency. We can see the difference between those ones being kept down and those ones accidentally rising up a little bit. And with this lean back it gives this probably more of a lift than it should have got based on the power that was in the kick. But again just pushing off with a leg lean back. So far once it extends again it's going to give it that extra lift here. So in this video, even though it is called penalty kicks, it looks to be more of a kind of passing, stance passing type exercise where the ball is just being played to this player in the goal and kind of back and it's up and it's back and the players from time to time knocking it to the sides, different parts of the goal on entry but pretty much low. So there's no approach from the player, generally from most of these, as the ball is rolled to the player. The ball already has momentum, the player is pretty static upon connection with the ball so not bringing much momentum themselves to the ball but the ball is bringing the momentum to their kick and their connection. But we will look at, nonetheless, we will look at the technique that is used in the kicks, the connection on the kicks, the power on the kicks, the spin used if there is any and then just the overall stance and body shape. Usually we would look at the point of entry but it's not really looking like this player is trying to score shots more than kind of play passes back and forward with this player that's in the goal. Straight away also just noticing on the technique, bit of a dangerous step into the ball here. As we can see the player is bringing momentum this direction, foot pointing in this direction, weight could end up going over on that ankle if they are going to bring momentum with the upper body through. This could be considered a dangerous kind of a do not do in terms of stance when kicking a ball because again it's just not very healthy on that ankle, putting weight on it whilst it's twisted inwards. So just an interesting one here as we see this ball kind of move and take its first bounce and kind of rolls from here to when it bounces we'll see that there is Neutral spin on the ball. So no spin on the ball as the ball has come in towards the right foot Just before the connection we see it takes just a little hop up and a little bounce Which could cause the connection to be made with a lower part of the ball Which will cause the ball to in turn bobble up again but what the players doing a good job at consistently here is Making connections as mentioned in the last recording with the center of the ball and kind of pushing through the center of the ball Not making connections with the bottom of the ball despite the foot Kind of being almost angled downwards from the ankle to the toe The player again is doing well to keep the ball down despite the lean back and it's just good connection control and accurate connections on the ball when redirecting it Again, just on this connection, massive lean back here. See the leg, very exposed, nearly parallel with the ground. Shortly after the kick, the connection is made. And a big lean back and also a big twist on the shoulder. So overall, very off balance. The shot does not get affected here because the player has elected to just kind of go inside of the foot and keeping it low into this bottom corner. But if the player brings power and uses this kind of a stance, there is a big risk that this ball can go extremely high because of the angle that the player is leaning back at. There's also a little bit of a disconnect between both cameras, both points of view. We can see here a little bit of distance on the ball. Here the ball is still touching the foot. But with that being said, we see the player kind of leaning back. We've got the flat foot almost pointing downwards if pointing in any direction. So kind of a strange one for shooting or passing. The only time we'd want to see a foot angled down that way would be if they're following through in a straight forward motion to try to expose the laces to the ball and connect with the laces. But generally with a pass, you would rather see actually the opposite where the toe is pointing up if anything. And we're wrapping our foot around the ball to get that kind of upward spin and help it speed into our target a little bit faster.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I think that this might actually be the finish hold. I think the root setters might want a bat hang here, a full on bat hang, which is when you put toe hooks above your head and release your hands and hang upside down from your feet. And I think that that's what's being set up here. So, after switching the feet on the start hold, you can see the left foot is on the start hold now. The climber is able to lock down this right hand and get into this interesting hold I would call a cobble. It's just kind of a round, not so good, not so bad sloping thing. And so here we have the climber. Start hold was this yellow brick pinch here, and you see they're going up into this left descending pinch. And I've gone over the descending pinch a couple times, so I will skip over it for now. And so as the climber was trying to release the right hand and commit to the bat hang, their toe hooks just fall out and this is what happens. Um, they roll out, luckily they didn't get hurt. Uh, it's always good when they, uh, kind of front flip out of it. I did notice that this hold was on. Seems like maybe the right hand here, rather than the right hand being up here will make it easier to release the toe hooks that are chilling there and then would allow them to match what I think is the finish hold, but nevertheless, it's a pretty good attempt. So then the climber bumps off of this green hold, which you can see here, and goes into this left hand jug, which is pretty cool. You're still driving off of this low hand, which was probably much better than what the left hand was on, but they're having to lock off even deeper with the right hand, and they're able to get into this jug. When the climber was able to get up and right into this two-foot hold, you see that they are putting their right foot on the start hold here. This is also a good look at this left-hand green pinch.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

However, he is moving his shoulders quite a bit, which is adding a lot of extra movement that's throwing him off from the rhythm and the tempo of the music. He also has his gaze quite low throughout this step, which shows that he might not be as confident or makes him appear less confident. If he were to lift his gaze and appear more confident in the movement in general, as well as bring some clarity, or not clarity, but refinement to the arms and the upper body, he would really enhance this step and this would allow him to add additional movement dynamics into this phrase. As the dancer begins by performing this basic step touch, he engages his arms choreographically in a way that's clear and appropriate for the movement technique. And he has a nice range of motion in his shoulders. However, he's moving his shoulders in a way that I feel is distracting him or pulling him off from the rhythm of the music. While maintaining this movement, perhaps just taking it down a notch, moving a little bit smaller and with more precision and clarity would benefit him here. He's able to stay connected to the music, particularly through the use of his feet, and a more enhanced use or more range of motion in the pelvis would also be welcome. As the dancer performs a step touch, he appears confident in his movement, now with his gaze lifted a bit higher. He's also engaging his arms in a way that's connected to the rhythm, is clear, and is choreographically appropriate. The movement in his shoulders is small, it's adding a nice texture and dynamic to his movement, and he's staying closely connected to the rhythm through the use of his feet as well as his head. As a dancer performs this cross step, he follows off the rhythm quite a bit more than he was before. He also, while he's using his arms choreographically, would benefit from some added dynamics in his arms and his upper body in general. As he's performing this cross step, he's making fairly large movements, particularly with his lower body, which is keeping him back from what the tempo is demanding from him.

This does take away from the layout. It takes away from the drill. It takes away from the practice. So just being able to pick up the speed, pick up the pace to get a better look at this is definitely a helpful point to improve the consistency of the layout. Where this hand is at is proper. I think this is right where that follow through is going in at. Unlike a hook shot or unlike the follow through being here or here, I think this angle gives him the best chance at making the layup just based on this view. Ball placement on the layup was on the top right side, which resulted to a miss on the layup. You want to be able to hit that ball right here in the middle and also putting spin on that is going to add additional to that. So if you want to throw the ball a little bit over to the right, take some spin off. If you want to bring it over to the right, make sure you put the right amount of spin on. So understanding the dynamic of the spin and understanding the dynamic of where you hit the backboard and make sure it's a good combination. Ball placement is kind of low. You want to be able to have that ball high and tight around your chest area to explode up. Going into your layup. So just understand, you're going into the layup, you want to have it a little bit higher and a little bit tighter so you can explode up and go off the backboard for the layup. Eyes are up on the target. That's great versus being here and taking your eyes off the target. Good vision, good way to have your heads up. To get a better motion, I think he could start a little bit further out in order to give himself a more realistic approach at this versus taking one to four steps and going into the layup. Dribbling with your right hand going right, of course, is proper. So I think either way, he dribbles, but lays it up with his right hand. It's good. It's a good finish. Due to the wall being in the background and I have an excess room to run or jump stop properly after you lay up, I think the placement here is good.

As we look on the left frame on our player's release attempt on his reverse right-handed layup, the player does a solid job at directing the ball by rotating his follow-through hand towards the right, towards our targeted area, allowing the ball to be guided towards the target to have the opportunity of dropping through the net in its proper angle. As we look on the release on the player's right-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice on the right frame the player does not get enough lift off the ground to generate and help propel the ball to get above the rim to be able to hit our targeted area and create the proper angle it needs to drop through the net. As we look on the left frame we can notice that the player does a solid job of trying to rotate his follow-through hand towards the directed target, however, does not generate enough power it needs to be able to hit our targeted area, resulting in a missed attempt. A slight improvement we can make as the player is going into his right-handed reverse layup attempt on the right frame is to bring his ball placement position higher towards his shoulder area, creating more security and protection on the ball from opposing defenders in a game-like scenario being in their defensive stance, having easy access of stripping, taking, or stealing the ball. As we look at the player go into his gather attempt for his right-handed reverse layup, on the right frame we can notice that the player does a decent job of starting his body position lower in a slight athletic stance. However, the player can be even lower to create more balance, power, and explosiveness on his drive, jumping towards the rim. As we look at the release of the player's right-handed reverse layup attempt, the player does a solid job at getting enough lift off the ground to allow and generate more power so the ball can get above the rim to be able to hit our targeted area and develop the proper angle it needs to drop through the net. Thanks for watching! A slight adjustment we will want to make to improve on creating more security and protection for the offensive player. As we look on the right frame, is to bring his ball placement position a little bit higher towards his shoulder area. Creating a closer opportunity for the ball to hit our targeted area and bringing it away from opposing defenders being able to attempt to steal, take, or strip the ball. As we look at the release attempt on the player's right-handed reverse layup on the left side of the frame, again, the player does really well at having his follow-through hand rotated towards the right, directing the ball to do just that, to be able to get and have enough power and rotation it needs to get above the rim, to be able to hit our targeted area, which is the top right corner of the box on the backboard, creating the proper angle it needs to drop through the net, resulting in a completed layup attempt. As we look at the player go into his gather on the right side of the frame We want the player to initially Start his body placement position lower in the athletic stance Which will create more balance power and Efficiency going into his jump on his finish A slight adjustment we will want to make to improve on the players quickness towards his finish is to start his body placement position lowered towards the ground and the athletic stance on his drive to be able to create more power and balance and quickness getting to the rim on his finish. As we look at the player's release on his right-handed reverse layup attempt, again, on the left side of the frame, the player does really well at having his follow-through hand slightly rotated towards the right, allowing the ball to generate enough force and accuracy it needs, and also rotation, to get above the rim to create the proper angle going through the net, resulting in a completed layup attempt. As we look at the player go into his gather attempt on the right-handed reverse layup on the right frame Again, the player does really well At keeping his eyes locked in on his target to be able to create an easier finish and also incorporating the correct footwork by stepping initially with his right foot first and Jumping off his left jumping leg Guiding his body's momentum going towards the rim As we look at the release of the player's right-handed reverse layup attempt, we can look on the right frame and notice that the player's body momentum is bringing him away from the basket towards the right, not allowing the ball, as we look on the left side of the frame, to generate enough power and ease to get above the rim to be able to hit our targeted area, which is a little bit higher, hitting the top right corner on the box on the backboard. This location on the ball is slightly below our targeted area, creating a good angle for the ball to get in the rim, however not sustaining enough accuracy it needs to go through the net, causing the ball to bounce out, resulting in an incomplete layup attempt. Also, the offensive player bringing his ball placement position higher towards his shoulder area will also allow an easier finish guiding the ball closer towards our designated target area. As we look at the player go into his gather on the right-handed reverse layup attempt I'm a right frame the player does really well at Locating his target with his eyes focusing on his finish He also does really well at incorporating the proper footwork by stepping initially with his right foot and jumping off his left Leg Carrying his body's momentum towards the rim", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Executing 1, 2, 3, 4. The 4 being when the music is heightened. So now he's back on rhythm. The dancer keeps changing his head in space in which direction he is looking in, whether it's up, down, side, tilted. His head is not in line with the rest of his vertebrae. It's important that his head stays in line because it is part of his spine. And when he's moving it around like this, he's out of alignment. It's nice that he's also trying to incorporate his arms, but his arms are usually a bit far from his body, whether they're up or whether they're out. It would make more sense if his arms mimicked his legs and they were close to his body in front of him, as if they were flowing through water or beating drums instead of being extended so far out from his body and from his center. The dancer is not using his hips in the way that is important for a basic but chop the dance steps. Every time if he steps outward with his left foot his hips should be going also with him. So if he is stepping with his his left foot his hips should be moving to oppositely to his right side and then when he brings his feet back together his hips would be moving to his left. If he steps again outward, his hips should be moving to the right and then back together. When he gathers right foot his hips should be moving to the left. It would be the opposite when he steps outward with his right foot to the right side his hips should be moving towards the left shifted to the left. When he comes back together bringing his left foot into the center his hips should be moving to the right. When he brings his right foot outward toward the right side his hips should be moving to the left. When he brings his left foot back in to tap it, his hips should be moving to the right. So his hips should really have a horizontal movement right and left, which is the opposite of what his feet are doing. He just got back on rhythm here. Every time he's doing that fourth step in which he's touching his toe, as you see here, his toe is on the floor and his heel is up, which is correct. That count four should be when we hear some emphasis in the music. The music is playing boom, boom, boom, ah, and on that like different sound, that fourth sound is when his toe should be tapping here. So in this very moment, he got back onto rhythm, but most of the time before this, he was not on the rhythm of the music. The dancer is looking downward here and there's really no need for him to look downward. He really should be looking outward and focusing while he's dancing. Sometimes when the dancer turns around, he nods his head up and down as he just did. These excessive head movements aren't necessary and it's distracting from the basic step in which he's trying to execute, which should be really emphasized in his hips and in his legs. I'm not quite sure why his arm is up like this. Perhaps he's imagining dancing with a partner and twirling her, but because he does not have a partner, it doesn't really make sense for him to be moving his arm upward like this. It's as if dancing with a ghost partner, and in the sense it's just a bit awkward. The dancer missed the cue of when he should start his movement when the beat dropped, so he's already off rhythm once he begins. The dancer is still shifting his arms a lot away from his body and they're not coordinated with the rest of his body. The dancer is now back off rhythm. He did a couple of extra steps in between when he was changing direction and now he's no longer on the rhythm one two three and four with the music anymore. To draw out what I was just saying about his hip movements, here he's stepping outward with his left foot to his left and in this situation his hips should be moving to the right opposite of what his feet are or opposite of what his feet is doing. The dancer could be traveling more with each of these bachata steps he's doing, whether he's going side to side or turning, going vertical or going on a diagonal, like any direction he's doing the step in is fine, but it should be further steps. He should be taking up a lot more space, so that's more energetic. Right now he's dancing underneath himself, and there's no reason to do that because he has a whole big dance to do here in which he can travel within. The dancer is executing a set of basic bachata steps, which is stepping one, two, three, and then bringing his feet together, four. Count one, his feet are apart. Count two, his feet are together. Count three, his feet are apart. Count four, his feet are together, in which he's doing a toe tap or tapping his toe onto the ground. His rhythm in terms of what he is doing is correct most of the time. However, it's not on rhythm with the music that is playing behind him. So he is executing four steps most of the time, but not in sequence with the rhythm of the music.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You gather all your stuff, your mise en place, get all your stuff together. And that way you don't have to keep moving around and looking for things.

He should maybe put a pot there and start getting it warm so when he throws his milk and water into the pot, it can come to a...it can heat up rapidly.

He prepared stirring the tea to incorporate all the ingredients that he added to the tea. The preparer should clean up at the workstation. The execution of the tea go a lot smoother. He's got a lot of clutter around and he needs to be more organized. I would like to see the preparer maybe taste the tea, taste it for flavor, instead of like gradually adding sugar at the beginning, wait for the tea to come to the desired temperature, throw one spoon of sugar in there, spin it around, taste it. You know, it could be too sweet, it might not be sweet enough. He has way too many things in the sink. The repair needs to have a little, do a little clean up.

And that's a really inefficient thing to do on difficult holds because they're sitting on the ground, they have the ability to really position their body well before establishing on the wall. So ideally, once they're established, they can just pull into the first move and not need to pump their hands at all. So climber is struggling to figure out how to match this hold and right now they basically have their hands stacked one over the other which is a really difficult position to recover. Ideally they have the left hand slid either to the left or the right before trying to bring the right hand into match to give space to the right hand hold. Alternatively they can try to bypass and just cross over with the right hand and not bother with the match if they're strong enough.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And it just looks like she's not in the proper position to hold it. It seems like she's pulling a lot through this foot. And that's actually the foot that cuts and ends up causing her to fall off. I think the missing ingredient is that she needs to push more at this right foot for her to get this, cause her hips should be a little bit further over. So she should focus on getting this knee over this foothold so she can toe down straight down through it. But when she's in that position, she'll be able to really casually hit this hold and keep the tension. But as long as this kind of foot's towing this way against her, it's going to slip off.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And in that move we can see that they were hanging on with a right hand on the starting handhold. And they did have a right foot behind the body. And then we can see that with this movement that their left leg is now kind of kicking out into the side over there. So by using the left hand and right foot she does allow herself to really rotate her body in an appropriate way so that her right side of her body gets closer to the wall. So this is a good thing to see. The one thing that's making this move a little bit more difficult for this clamor is what's going on with that left flagging foot. So because the clamor is kind of kicking that leg out away from the wall this kind of shows to me that the clamor is not entirely comfortable of what's going on with her right foot and might be generating some power with her left leg in order to complete this move here. But by kicking her leg in this direction it's actually helping to pull her body away from the wall. So it could be harder to complete this move overall. So I would definitely recommend to the clamor that they focus on controlling what's going on with the flagging foot and making sure it's in the same position from the beginning of the move to the end of the move and to reduce the amount of kicking that they're doing. And so here we can see the clammer is having a little bit of difficulty of what to do next But she has been able to switch her feet so now her left foot is on the foothold And we can see that her right foot is kind of in this bent position So it should be the flagging foot that should be a little bit more out and direct kind of pressed up against the wall So because her right flagging foot is in this bent position It's actually not really helping her out too much to be able to trust her lower body positioning But by allowing that right foot to kind of be extended out more to the right She can then allow the left side of body to kind of rotate and pivot around that foot And then another thing that we can see the clammer is doing is she is having a hard time hanging on to that right hand Hold so we do see that she's kind of pulling or engaging with that right arm to try and make that feel better But being that this hold is kind of flat on the top By pulling into it is actually making it harder to hang on to this handhold So I would definitely encourage the clammer to train make sure that they keep their arm in a straight position So then that way they can get the best use out of this handhold", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And then your fingers will learn and memorize those spots faster, rather than practicing finding them. Good sitting posture, chairs a little low. This is a much better position. It's forced him to be in this position because of the key that they're playing in right now. It requires a black key on that first note, which brings the thumb forward, but this is kind of the position that needs to be in the whole time. The fingers tend to be pretty far away. They're really straight toward the keys here, and that makes that big gap in the thumb here. Not the best technique.

I mean, here you can see how he pulls his shooting hand back. Hold it out there until it hits rim. Again, really does a lot, pushes off the left foot. I would love for him to shoot off two feet versus one, but this is a great example of how the guide hand is not shooting the basketball. It's there, and great hand placement. This looks really, really good. Again, kind of throws the right leg out, going off the left foot. His weight needs to be a little bit more evenly distributed. This is just gorgeous. Nice, nice job there. Again, hold that follow-through. I mean, the ball has beautiful arc to the basket. Again, he's just kind of standing straight up on the landing. You want to prevent injury, too, so let's absorb that landing with bending our knees. Again, beautiful extension of the shooting arms, snapping that wrist down. You can see how a lot of his push-off is off his left foot, and he kind of raises his right leg, and he little falls back just a little bit. So he's a little bit off balance. Nothing wrong with it. Sometimes it's just a way a lot of people shoot. They kind of fall back because there's defense. But let's extend that shooting elbow maybe a little bit more, but nice shot. Again, even his takeoff, he's just kind of pushing off the left foot and the right leg just kind of goes up. He's just kind of, I don't know, like one leg in it, if you will. I'm not sure what to even call it. But you're a little off balance. You're not, you know, maybe as balanced as you need to be to finish. But, you know, he's got a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful follow through. And getting better than that. Again, let's move that guide hand in a little bit. Here again, pushes off that left foot, kind of falling back to your left a little bit. But I love how his fingers are spread on the ball as he shoots it. This is nice here. He's got that palm of that offhand facing in. But again, let's balance ourself up here a little bit. Again, a lot of movement is off this left foot. Let's evenly distribute the weight of the landing and the takeoff. Beautiful extension, nice snapping of the wrists. Let's move this elbow in of the guide hand and face that palm in. But really, really nice here. And again, Land's kind of a lot of the weight on this left foot. He's kind of locked out his knees. You know, the ball's still in the air. Let's hold that follow-through. Keep it high. You know, you don't see it in this picture. I would really recommend just holding that follow-through until the ball touches. Well, this is a 15-footer, a jump shot. Again, in this drill, I would love to see the shooter just more in a basketball position, I would say, or stance. Like you're waiting for this pass in a game or in this drill. Like have your, you know, maybe step into this pass, have your knees bent, drop your hips, really meet this pass, if you will. You can see his hands getting ready here to catch it. He's a right-hand shooter, so instead of catching it with your left, let's catch it with our right hand and let's backstop it. So we can just catch and shoot it. If you catch it with your left and you're a right-hand shooter, then you've got to move it to your right, and it just takes seconds. And seconds mean you're going to be defended. So the quicker, the better. The readiness, the better. And you know, you can see on the release, he pulls back his shooting arm. Let's hold it. Let's hold it. Extend that follow through to the back. Ball hits the rim. Again, he kind of falls back on his left foot, therefore kind of losing balance here. Want a little more stability and cushion on the landing. Again, it's kind of turned, looks like he's got his shoulders turned inward a little bit. I'm really dissecting this shot here. Love the lift here, but he's kind of turned inward a little bit. Let's face our body to the rim, kind of short arm it here. Let's really extend the shooting arm. I like how he doesn't use the guide hand to shoot it. It's there, but not using it in the rotation, the shot of the ball. Again, you can see how his weight is just not evenly distributed when he pushes off and then when he lands. Again, just would like to be more faced up and balanced in that movement. Good extension, good snapping of the wrist down, fingers are down, that's nice. And you know, and on his landing, because he's released and he's come down, let's hold that follow through. And you know, a lot of times he's just coming down a little bit straight legged. You know, let's absorb the shock of coming down by coming on our balls of our feet, bending our knees, dropping our hips a little bit. So, beautiful, pretty good touch here. Great extension of the right arm, shooting hand. See how it lifts high, snaps that wrist down. This is actually really, really good. The guide hand, I would just move that elbow in so that forearm is parallel to the floor. Let's get that guide hand, the palm of that guide hand facing inward. But, you know, I love that he's extending up and going up, but, and I'm not sure you can see it, but when he lands, a lot of his weight is landing on this left foot, and then he kind of falls back. So, let's land on both feet. Let's be more balanced.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}
