And as they go up to this jug here, they just, I think maybe lose a little bit of tension and can't quite open up. So yeah, definitely want to use the underside of the pinch, I think. Here we have the Climber 1 move in on this boulder, and you can get a pretty good look at what this hold is like. It's basically shaped like a telephone, so it's like this. You can get all the way around it. This is the wall, which is kind of cool. It's also pretty fat, so you do have to pinch it. It's an interesting hold. Kramer then tags this yellow greenish sloper rail, bumps the left hand all the way in, gets into the crease where the top side of the hold hits the wall, and pounces up and right into this jug pinch here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This is called flagging out and it transfers over the weight to the left foot being in place. However, when the climber pushes into that left foot towards the hold, not only gave him direction, but also when being pressed, it sends the climber's center of gravity away from the wall. So right now the climber is glancing down at the feet to perform a foot switch. The climber performs the next move by sending the right hand over the left hand, both with the hands on the same holder. This is called matching and places the hand not only above but mostly to try to pinch the inside of the hold, left side part of the lip. So the climber is using his thumb that's placed on the outside and the fingers on the inside to pinch onto the lip. While keeping the left foot out of space and towards the wall, not placing any footholds and instead has pressed down onto the right foot so that he can try to keep his center of gravity underneath his left hand grip to make it an easy transition out left. The climbers right foot had slipped off from the hold while adjusting the grip. This is potentially due to a lack of accuracy on the foot placement and a mix of the climber potentially not applying sufficient pressure onto the right foot when releasing some pressure of the grip to adjust it. If he was to attempt this again he needs to make sure that he keeps the flag forcefully to help with the pressure of the right foot being in place. As the climber had made the right foot placement, he is adjusting the right hand grip, jumping over the hand placement, his right foot has come out of place. This obviously will compromise the grips by overloading them and will be really hard for him to recover at this move. The climbers are starting at a two-hand hold start. For the right hand, he's applying a pinch grip as he places the fingers onto one side and the thumb onto the other. And for the application for it, he would have to squeeze onto the hold and pull it back. For the left hand and the other hand, he is sustaining to a very small hold, placing the finger pads over the hold. This is type of a knob-like that is shallow, so he is actually using the thumb onto the one side to close the grip. This type of grip is called a crimp, and in this case, this would be an open crimp because he places the finger onto the side. And in order to create pressure in sustaining it, the climber must keep the elbow close to the wall. The climbers are starting at a sit start, so he is placing right now the right foot at a higher stance, and as soon as he gets himself positioned to transfer over the weight to the feet and to the grips, he will then lift the left foot from the mat, and then the climb will start. The clamberhack lands down at the feet and applies a foot switching technique that's called the jump off jump on where he jumps off the left foot while the right foot is hovering over it and then jumps the right toe to be placed over the hold. This method of foot switching works but is also not the most accurate as it takes a fair bit of energy and if that foothold is small it would be hard to do this and this is a medium-sized hold. Before the climb we're glancing over to the next hold at reach. He has brought the left foot to be placed over the orange hold left side. He will use this to push it over to bring him over to the left side when performing the reach. The climbers first move out of the start as into this large pocket. As we can see, the climber places only a few fingers over the edge of the hold. As there is a hole inside of the hold that is sharp, the climber must place the fingers behind the edge of the hold. That's the only way that it seems to be positive. It was a good idea of the climber to keep the right hand on the hold as this one is a pinch and the climber can bring the elbow out comparatively from the crimp. That is a very limited hold to sustain. As we can see the climber's form, he had press on the right foot that gave him height. For balance, the move was done by the left foot which was out in space and brought towards the wall with the leg extended. This type of form is called flagging out. When the climber was going out for the reach, the climber sends the left foot over to the right side. This is to balance over his main areas of support and to bring the center of gravity close to the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Even if it's a lateral one that you can essentially hang underneath, it's good to control it this way. And climber's got this left foot pretty far out to the left. The climber attempts to go up to this green pinch, but as the climber grabs it, they start to accelerate to the left. So in a sense, this pinch sort of takes the climber, is how we would say it, and they're just unable to control this. You can see their left foot blows, and it just is a little too fast, a little too soon for the climber.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He's got the height which means he's probably got the power to do this. All he needs to do is pull himself up over his feet slightly more. And when his hips are the closest to the wall, then focus on jumping up and to the right. So it looks like he's got the height, jumping in properly, that if he combines the proper position with this power, he should be able to hit it. So yeah, it just looks like he's launching for the hold while his hips are still decently far from the wall. And that's kind of driving him out away from the wall. And when he lands, he's going to land back here instead of landing closer to the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They're a little too focused on the hands Which is why we see the foot kind of pop off the first move before they begin setting up Ideally they can make the first few moves static by coming underneath into this undercling and then reaching up to the hold But the way there's charging up anticipates that they just want to commit to making this a bigger move, which is Potentially doable but much higher risk. It's such a large move that if they make a mistake attempting it It's gonna invalidate the attempt. They'll just fall So you see a climber releasing way too early, their foot's almost on the ground as their hand is reaching towards the hold, so there's just no chance they're going to be able to hit it from this position. It's probably doable as a dyno to jump across that way, but for the way they're climbing it, they're just not going to hit the move this way and it causes them to fall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

As we can see when the climber went up for the reach she had kept the right knee to come inwards and that helped for the climber to keep her right side of the body towards the wall when performing the reach. The climber was able to send the left hand quickly to the next hole at reach, this one being a jug, where the climber is able to secure the hand placement. However, it's all about the body position. This one, because the left leg was out and extended as a flag, the climber only areas of support were onto the right side. So to avoid herself from doing a barn door, which is like, think of a hinge that opens up, the climber folds the left leg behind the right leg. This to add, with the left foot pointing out to the right, is to give more support to the right side and twists the body over to the left to bring her center of gravity close to the wall when performing the reach. The climber continues into a close pull up to lock the move. And this is because right now the climber is staring at the next hold at reach. This is because if the climber was to extend the arms right now, she will be dropping the weight too low, being really hard to pull in if she wanted to come back. The climber was able to recover the move by bringing the left foot to come into place over the start hold and she continues to glance down at the feet to perform a foot switch by bringing the right toe to come into place over the edge of the hold to release the left foot from its place. The climber performing this type of foot switch technique is the most accurate one. This is because it's more energy efficient and the climber can transfer the load easily from one foot to the other coming into place. The climber once securing the toe placement we can see how she has brought the knee to come inwards towards the wall so that she was able to transfer over the weight to the right foot. In doing so the climber quickly releases the right hand to bring it over to a match at the hold above. The climber was able to place the left hand grip into a solid hand grip. This one because the climber is sustaining to the lip of the hold being a rail and is able to place the fingers behind the lip of the hold. Once the climber gets to secure the grip, then the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the highest grip. The climber right now is glancing at a hold at reach. This one the climber will have to perform a dynamic move. Reason why she has lower her center of gravity and extended the arms in order to gain energy over the jump. As we can see the left leg being extended. This is called flagging out and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. Now the right foot when being pressed for going up for the dynamic move will help the climber to gain height. And the left toe tapped against the wall will help the climber to gain direction on the reach as well as bringing her center of gravity close to the wall when performing the stance. In this case, before the climber was able to perform the next move at reach, she is bringing the right toe to come out of match at the foot hold. And this is so the climber is performing a foot switch where she is placing the outer edge of the toe towards the hold. And as soon as the climber releases the left toe from its place, the climber then will roll in the toe above the hold. The climber on the lock position sends quickly the left hand out for the reach, this one being a positive grip as the climber is able to wrap the hand over the hold. The climber was able to gain a stability over the movement by sending the right leg to be extended behind the left foot. This again back flagging so the climber can gain a stability over the move and quickly once it's stabilized the climber sends the left hand over to the jug to come into a match where the right hand is. The climber at first was struggling on making a foot placement for the left toe but brings it quickly into a high foot placement to bring it behind the hold securing the toe placement. As soon as the climber applied pressure onto the foothold, the climber's right toe has come out of place from the hold. Right now the climber is sustaining onto the grips for a slight swing due to the wall being overhung. It's important the climber always glances down at the feet, especially when making a new foot placement. In this case, the climber is bringing the left toe to come into a high foot placement over the foot hold. This one sticks out and makes it possible for the climber to place a good chunk area of the toe over the hold. Once the climber gets secured the foot placement, then the climber can move on to the next hold at reach. Due to the opening of the left hand grip being slightly onto the left side, the climber must drop the weight by leaning back to the right. And now the climber is twisting the body completely at a 180 to bring the right side of the body towards the wall in order to bring the left foot to a high foot placement. The climber starts at a one hold start. As we can see, both of the hands are placed into the same hold. This is called matching. And as we can see, the climber is placing the hands as open grips where she places the fingers over the edge of the hold. However, the climber must create pressure, the reason why the climber is leaning over to the left side due to the entry being onto the right side of the hold. The climber had performed a step up start, so once the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall, then the climb will start. And had positioned the left foot onto a foot hold. And bringing the knee in, so the climber can keep the left side of the body towards the wall. Now, when the climber had stepped up, the right leg has gone extended. This is called flagging out, so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. And keeping the leg on a flag when the climber performs the move will help the climber to gain balance and stability over the move. The climber had repositioned the right hand grip, this one to hook it behind the hold as the hold is a horn so the climber can continue to have a closed grip. In this case, the climber in releasing some of the pressure on the hand to readjust the grip she has kept the left leg to be extended. This is called flagging out so the climber was able to continue to apply pressure onto the right foot being in place. As we can see, the climber is sending the right knee over to the right to keep the hips square as the climber is pressing the right toe towards the lip of the hold onto the right side. Now the climber is glancing over to the next hold at reach. Due to the dynamic move, the climber has lost pressure at the right foot placement and now both of the feet in the air, the climber must sustain tight onto the grips to control the swing. And in able to bring the foot back into place onto the wall, the climber must engage body tension to tighten up the core to pick up the feet to replace the foot back onto the wall. When the feet are out in the air, this is called cutting feet. The climber at this moment is spending a considerable amount of time to look for a foot placement on the left foot and Right now the climber is sustaining to a positive grip above which the climber can sustain over for some time however Doing this for a while it can tire the grips The climber after positioning the toe over the foothold then she quickly releases the right hand that was underneath the left hand to send it over to the next hold at reach. This type of hold that she is sustaining, she is able to place the hand over the lip of the hold being a jug and once securing the grip the climber can extend the arm to drop the weight onto the grip. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet when performing a foot placement or a foot switch. In this case, the climber has brought the right foot that was out on the flag to bring the toe to come into place at a foothold. It's important that the climber is accurate with the placement on positioning exactly on a certain spot of the foothold as well as positioning the right area of the foot to create pressure. As we can see on this view, also the right hand was sustaining into a positive hold as the climber was able to wrap around the hand behind the lip of the hold. The climber now engages into a pull-up to bring the right hand over to a match at the last hold. This, the climber must demonstrate control and stability over the match as well as her body position in order to complete the climb. The climber is about to perform the next move at reach, sending the left hand up. So the climber in this moment is tapping the right toe towards the wall, this to engage more power over the reach as the climber will send the heart over the left foot and the tap will help the climber to drive force onto the stance.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This is so that the climber is able to maintain balance as he will need to force by shifting his weight onto the highest foot. Also when climber makes the move, it will help the climber to keep the hips square and to keep himself close to the wall. Here, in order for the climber to release the right toe out of place, he has brought the left toe to be placed on top of the matching hold that he had instead. This to release the right foot out of place. The climber continually needs to pull on the grips while making this foot switch. If the climber was going to try this again, it's important that the climber uses the resource of the left pinch. There's many forms in which a climber can achieve a series of moves to attain the goal. In this case, the right foot was way too high for the climber and made it very uncomfortable for him to shift the weight over to the highest foot. The outer side of the foot was what was placed onto that edge and it seemed promising that the climber's foot was going to remain in such place. However, what drove the climber's center of gravity away from the wall was the moment that he released his right hand. This due to the left foot not being placed on any hold down below, only relying on two points of contact at that moment. So it's important to the climber if he was going to attempt this again that he scans down at other areas where he can place his feet in order to release his right hand. When the climber released the left hand carefully from going underneath the foot and as soon as he places the elbow outside the leg, you can see how the climber was losing control of keeping himself in control to make the next move. Notice followed by the right foot coming out of place. The climber starts at a two hand hold start. As we can see the right hand is placed with the fingers above and the climber in order to create pressure has to lean underneath that hold. On the other hand, you can see how the climber's hold is upside down. This is a jug and in order to create friction the climber will have to place the palm upwards and slide the fingers behind the hold. Now in order for the climber to create pressure, we'll need to pull the hold towards him. As we can see the climb will start until the feet are off the mat, which he's already doing. The left foot right now is being placed on the foot chip down below. The right foot is coming into position to match where the left hand is. As the climber have reached the left hand to the pinch, we can see the climber sending the right foot that was out on the flag to be placed to match where his right hand grip is. The type of hold that the climber is holding onto and has placed the foot on, it's a ledge that sticks out so the climber can bring the right foot and apply sufficient pressure onto that edge with the outer side of the foot. This is an unusual placement as most likely he might potentially use this as a heel hook in the future if he continues to keep the foot on place. Now the climber is a bit crunched up to the right side and needs to release the right hand. In order to add force to the foot that's placed the highest, the climber has let go of the left foot placement down below. This to apply more force onto the right foot being placed which he will use almost like a third hand since this will keep the climber to keep himself pulled into the wall. Since the right foot has come into a stance, the climber quickly releases the left hand that was on the undercling so that he gets to bring it to a match where the right hand is. This one is a big hold so the climber is able to comfortably fit both of the hands by wrapping the fingers behind it and comfortably leaning on the hold. The climber places the toe above the hold as he pulls on the hold down below. This is called matching and it's important that the climber keeps pressure at the foot against the hold in order to sustain himself when pulling on the grips above. This because the climber is placing the entire leg in front of him. Now the climber will need to think about making the next movement.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Because the climber hasn't placed any foot placements onto the wall, he is right now engaging onto a pull-up in order to move on. This is called campusing. The climber, once sustaining the positive grip above being the edge, he is able to then lean back to place the weight onto the grip. As we can see, he's pivoting over his foot because he's sending the ankle outwards in order to smear the foot against the hold as he needs to continually have contact with the hold to not lose the foot placement. So it's like dragging the sole of the shoe to be repositioned where he can't face the wall this time. The climber performing campusing doesn't only involve fully on a pull-up, it also involves body movement and swinging to gain momentum. So when the climber is having the momentum of the swing, whenever he goes out for example to the right, he will engage that right arm on a pull-up to release the left hand. Whenever the climber is ready to engage of the left hand for example, then he will swing over the body over to the left in order to release the right hand. At this view we can see how the climber is sustaining to a jug hold and the good thing about jugs is that they can be held in any direction so the climber must squeeze into the hold forcefully in order to sustain the grip as he right now is going out on the swing almost as a pendulum totally on 180 at this moment so it's important that the climber eventually tightens up the core and engages on the pull up so that he's able to slow down the swing This is the ideal closeness that should be committed on this type of jump. As a climber, as we can see, the chest was brought forward and then the core, being the center of gravity, will follow as the climber starts gaining height. The left hand is still continuing to be on the hand placement and instead of pulling himself in, he's also pushing down onto that hand placement. But at this point, it's just a placement as the climber already is launched onto the air and eventually he will push down onto the right foot to boost the move. The right hand is already pretty close at distance since he has already removed it from the start hold. It's about a matter of time for the climber to bring the right hand to come into a slap above the hold. The climber is gaining momentum right now by swinging and also when doing so, the climber was constantly adjusting the grips. This is important. The climber secures the grips before committing onto the dynamic move. As the climber brings his center of gravity low, he's aiming at the hold of distance by making eye contact. It's important that he does so while building up on the momentum of the swing. This is because the climber will have to launch himself over to the hold and needs to make sure he gets to select which area of the hold he will make the hand placement as well. When the climber is ready, he will engage into a forceful pull and push down on the feet to bring his center of gravity close to the wall by bringing the chest forward against the wall. Now the climber pushing on the left foot will help him gain direction to stay underneath the hold and over going slightly to the right side. And eventually when the climber is gaining height, he will push onto the right foot in order to boost the jump. As we can see the climber was able to stabilize himself from swinging continuing to tighten up his body and at this moment the climber is glancing over to hold that distance since it's very difficult to do when the climber is swinging and it's important that he brings his center of gravity underneath his area of support before making the next move. In this case, the climber now's center of gravity is past the area of support. He has to send the left hand to bring himself to recover the move. So it's important that the climber continues to force the core to be tightened and try to pull himself in as he will continue to swing out. The climber is able to send the left hand up for a match at the jug. He is looking away so that he is able to gain more reach over the left hand placement. The climber must demonstrate control and stability over his body positioning as well as matching the hold. If the climber is able to do this, then the climb is completed. Here the climber was able to sustain onto that underhand onto the lip of the hold and has brought his center of gravity close to the wall, this one being on the core. And underhand placements are really strong as the climber is able to place the hand above him when his center of gravity was low by pulling away on the wall and it gets stronger when the climber gains height as he's able to pull the elbow close to his core once making a solid foot placement. Now the climber is sending the right hand over to the hole that reach, placing the hand over the corner top of the hold. The climber will be going out on the swing due to the right foot being engaged, pushing his center of gravity away from the wall. However, the climber was able to secure the right hand placement by wrapping the fingers around the thick edge of the hold and must create friction to catch by closing the grip. It's good that the climber secures the hand placement before he drops the weight. Dropping the weight will come into place once the climber gets to line up his center of gravity underneath his right hand placement. As he's going onto the swing, the climber is also bringing the left hand to bring it over to match the dining hold, which will help the climber support the swing by pulling in. Once the climber's center of gravity starts being pushed away, it's important that he tries to keep a body tension, mostly on the upper body, engaging in a slight pull up to pull himself in and tightening up the core so he doesn't get to swing out completely. The climber brought the right hand over too much at the same lip where the left hand is and The climber is now making an adjustment of the left hand to come as an under hand over the top edge of the hold This is preparing himself ahead of time For when making the right foot placement too soon once the climber makes that right foot placement He will gain height and at that point having both hands onto the same edge will be difficult to sustain as When the climber is just singing to the bottom edge She will have to be below the hold but in this case if he's going to be gaining height after making the height foot position then ideally would be that the climber sustains to the top area of the hold The climbers hand placement starts at a two hole start. This one each hand has its own hold and both of them are rounded with a hole in the inside of the hold. These ones are called donuts so the climbers able to slide the fingers all the way at the inside of the hold. This one as is with a groove in that area the climber can place the fingertips and squeeze onto the hold as he's able to place the thumbs on the outside of the hold in order to secure the grip. The climber once does it he will be able to lean back trusting on the grips in order to transfer over the weight. Also the climber has brought the feet onto placement the left foot is on a small foot hold and the right foot is on a larger hold where the climber is able to surface the front area of his shoe towards the flat surface of the hold. Since the climber is no longer in the mat and the climb will start. Because the climber was able to bring both of the hands at a match, he sensed the left foot to come into place at the large hold. Now the climber is pushing away from the hold in order to keep his center of gravity below his aerial reach. As the climber needed to gain height in this instance, he has pushed away in the hold as well as pulled himself tightly trying to lock the move. In this instance to send the left hand over to the next hold. This one is a promising hold as the climber has a deep area where the climber can place the fingertips behind the edge of the hold and can sustain it also by pressing on the thumb to secure the grip. As for his body positioning, we can see how his right leg has been extended. This is called flagging out and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place as well as keeping his right side towards the wall to keep his center of gravity underneath the top area of support. For performing the canvassing movement, it's not only that the climber engages in the pull-up, but also he takes advantage of the momentum on his body moving. So in this case, when the climber's body is moving out to the right, he is able to engage in a pull so he can transfer over the left hand to come into a match. Once the climber is airborne, there is going to be a fraction of a second where he's no longer in contact with the wall. This is the moment where he jumps, all of the limbs leave the holds and his right hand is about to come into placement at the hold. In this case, the climber must force the contact of the right hand onto the Dine Hold when having this moment. This moment the climber made a right foot placement and this one being high up the climber then now needs to continue to apply force to the top left hand placement. This one not only he is pulling down on his right hand but this time he is actually pulling away from the wall with the left hand. This one pulling the hold in two different directions so that he's able to secure his movement as he gains height. The next hold is the one distance in which the climber will have to gain sufficient height by fully standing up in order to transition the right hand later on to come into a match at the hold or potentially going up for the reach. The left hand grip the one that is up over underhand this one will need to be sustained when gaining height with the elbow close to the core in order to apply gripping power. At this moment the climber is at mid-jump and we can see how he has pulled himself in, trying to bring the chest as close as he can to the wall, and already has pushed away the left foot from its foothold, sending him already at that direction to stay underneath the hold. As the climber was swinging, he kept adjusting his hand placements. It's important that the climber focuses on making those placements secure before committing onto the dino jump. In this case, the climber is already had swung and right now he's extending his arms to lower his center of gravity and keep the feet above him as he will have to spring out of the move in order to make the hold that reach. As the climber needs to make the hold that reach, it's important that he stares at the hold at distance when positioning his body and while making the swing. The swing was so that the climber is able to gain momentum for when he's ready. He will pull himself forward, bringing the chest towards the wall and he will be pushing down on the feet. The left foot will be used to spring him out over to that direction to stay underneath the hold and then eventually the right foot will be engaged to boost the jump.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Now in this case climber generated so much power and coordination from down below where once generated the power the climber had a huge swing. This is a bit difficult as the climber you know if there is a big swing then the climber will not be able to hold on to the hold above. So it's important to know how much of power the climber is generating before getting on to the hold. As this is a dynamic movement the climber needs to make an efficient movement and also make it less physical or taxing. In this case this made climber potentially not being able to grip the hold enough due to the power generated on the swing. Here we can see the climber rocking back and forth and this so that the climber can secure the feet and also generate power when making the movement up from the pull up to the next move up. Now the climber right now when rocks back and forth is transferring weight first to the right foot that is placed the highest and then when the climber is down below it uses the left foot and then once the climber gets to stand up and create a dynamic move up to the next hold the climber will be pressing down on the left foot first and then bringing his hips over the highest foot being the right then to move up their hand as they stand up on the right foot. Here's a point of the climber to visualize the wall before starting the climb. Now we can see the climber performing some hand gestures, which this will help the climber have an idea of what the sequence of his hands movements will be when on the wall. Here we can see the climber going up for a dyno. This is where the climber needs to really make a commitment on knowing exactly where the hold is going to be held. This one in this case the climber thought of the right hand going up and exactly wanting to place the hand where he has it. Now the dynamic move comes out with a lot of force as the climber was squatting transferring the weight from the foot left to right and once the climber was ready by doing a sprint up to the hold the climber once gets to stick the hand onto the hold then the body will dynamically want to pendulum out of the wall due to the force. So the climber in order to sustain the grip will must to is not only create pressure generated from the open hand grip that the climber has in this moment but it would also need to bring their chest forward and try to use your core to bring their feet back onto the wall to avoid peeling off the wall. Here we can see the climber starting at a two-hold start hold. Each hand has a donut, is a type of hold that the climber is holding on to, and to create pressure the climber is pinching it using all of their hand to create the pinch. The climber also needs to generate a lot of power while hanging on to it and does this by leaning back. Also leaning back is called the rest position and can help the climber keep power or not get so tired when having the arms extended and only engaging the grips as the climber makes the placement onto the wall for the feet. Now once the feet are on the wall and the climbers off the mat then the climber starts.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

On the right hand he's holding on to a pinch so he has to aim the elbow away to the right side since the climber is standing right underneath the grips. Simpsons the climber was struggling on the grips and reason why the climber hasn't stepped off from the wall. The climber was going to do this again. He needs to make sure that he aims where the next move will be and as the left hand is placed as a mono, the climber is keeping the left hand as an undercling which this can be a powerful grip and in order to keep it in place the climber then eventually will have to bring the elbow close to the core when making the stance up to the next move. Heel hooks are powerful and as we can see the climber was able to engage into a forceful stance. This one engaging all of the standing power onto that right heel being placed. Once the climber was able to bring his center of gravity as close as he can to his right foot being the area of support, the climber also engages in a forceful pull up. This is called a lock off. In order for the climber to keep himself in that position, his left leg is extended behind the right leg being in position. The climber is tapping the toe against the wall. This is to sustain position while making the reach. As this was a wide hand placement, we can see the climber securing the grip on the left hand on a jug, meaning that the climber is able to place the fingers inside the hold, being able to have a positive grip, pulling away from the hold to create pressure. Now, the climber glances down at the feet because he must do a foot switch. Now, because the left leg being up kept the climber too cramped over, so in order to release some pressure down at the feet, the climber must pull tight on the grips. And the climber needs to make a quick foot switch because of the crunched up position, but also needs to make sure he is applying pressure with the foot coming in before he releases the left foot out of place. The climber is starting at a one hand hold start. As we see, both hands are placed onto the same hold and this is called matching. The climber is starting on a sit start, meaning that this will add a grade to the climb, since sit starts are difficult to come up from because the climber, once places the feet on the wall, he will need to raise his hips, applying weight into the limbs. Now that the climber has secured the grip on the right hand, the climber keeps the arm extended. This creates some pressure at the grips. The climber then brings the left foot to come into place to the area of where the heel hook is placed. It's important that the climber releases the heel hook with control as they create a lot of pressure on the pull and it's acting as a third hand in this instance. So the climber once creates pressure with the toe being in place into the hold, the climber is able to release the right foot from place. The climber quickly has made the right foot to come up to a higher stance. This one by placing the heel in first against the wall. The climber places it also above the edge of the whole foothold. In this case the climber is going glancing over to the next hold. So in order to make this reached move the climber is extending the arms to bring it to a rest and it's important the climber knows how to grip and hold position before committing to the move. As the left leg is extended, fold it behind it, hold behind the right leg. This is called flagging which the climber will then tap the toe in order to keep himself in position once he is up for the stance. While the climber was sustaining the jog with the match, the climber had blindly made a foot switch. This by making a feel of the left foot coming into place next to the right toe and quickly has placed the right foot onto a higher stance. Sending the heel into the wall so that the climber is able to use it as a heel hook for the next move. As we can see, the climber is making some hand gestures. This is because the climber is visualizing the wall. And creating the hand gestures will help the climber have an idea on what to expect on sequence when making the moves before getting onto the wall. It's important that the climber continues to pull on the monohull in order to create pressure. Right now the climber needs to glance over at the feet to fix the stance, as the climber will need to continue the rest of the climb, and keeping the arms bended for a long period of time can tire the climber's grip. As we can see the climber releases the right hand to bring it over to a match at the jug. For foot placement the climber has sent the left leg to be extended and this one is used for him to flagging in and has tapped the toe against the wall so that he can keep position when making the transfer of the hand over to the next grip. Here we can see how the climber is off to a start. This is because his body is no longer on the mat. As we can see the climber is glancing over to the left side and in order for him to achieve going out left he will have to send his left hand out for the next hold. For him to get direction the climber must sustain the left foot in place being the highest one and would have to keep a wide stance when making the move out left. To support the direction of the move the climber will have to press down on the right foot against the wall and extend the leg to support the reach. The climber here is shaking his hands. This will help the climber release any tension that has been built up. Also, shaking them will help the climber to have a slight warm up and regain energy for the climber to have a better grip when on the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And in this position we can see that they're hanging on with their right hand here and they're utilizing a left foot on this yellow hold here and I think their right foot is also on the wall as well right here. So in this position they are kind of setting themselves up to do a good transition over to that left side over there. The one thing that the climber needs to really make sure they focus on is continuing to transition over that left foot just because it is guiding them in the direction that they need to go to so the more that they can transition their body weight over that left foot the better it's going to be and give them a better chance of hanging on to the hold overall. And so here we can see the climber is getting closer to that yellow hole that they're aiming for But as they're doing that we can see that their left foot has now slipped off of the foothold It almost kind of seems as if the climber was trying to make this a powerful Dynamic move or they kind of had to jump off that foot in order to reach it But by doing so they did place the rest of the body kind of hanging out away from the wall now Because their foot is no longer on that foothold So what I would encourage for the climbers to continue to transition Their left knee over that left foot and making sure that left foot stays in that foothold Which will give them the best chance of gathering on to that yellow hole they're aiming for and continue further movement after that", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

That way the climber does not lose pressure of the left foot placement and potential being able to get closer to the wall to make the reach. The climber right now is lowering her center of gravity due to having to perform a dynamic move next. As she is glancing over to the hold at reach, she lowers her center of gravity to stay underneath her grips by extending the arms as well as pushing over with the left foot against the hold so that she remains underneath her grips. Now when the climber is ready, she will then engage in a forceful pull up and press down mostly on the right foot to gain direction over to the hold at reach. The climber right now is chucking up and the pouch that she has attached to her is a chalk bag where she places each hand inside of the bag then later spreads them onto the palms. The chalk will help the climber to gain a better grip when sustaining the holds as well as absorbing any moisture that may be coming from her hands. The climber wasn't able to make the hand over to the edge of the hold when performing the reach. A couple things are because the climber must gain more momentum down below when coming off to the dynamic move when pressing to bring the left hand over to the hold at reach. However, we can see how her center of gravity is slightly away from the wall when performing the reach and this is because the climber's left foot has not been adjusted to go over the hold where the climber should have placed the foot slightly above to have the toe roll into the top of the hold. In this case when the climber was transferring over the weight to make the jump in the stance, we can see how the foot is still placed onto the right side and when performing the move the climber wasn't able to bring her hips close to the wall and instead is being slightly pushed away enabling her to make the reach. The climber starts until she is no longer standing on the mat. So she's in her first position, sustaining to a one-hold start, where both hands place into the same hold. This is called matching. The type of hold she's sustaining is called a jug, because the climber is able to wrap the hands around the lip of the hold. Now, the climber needs to transfer over the weight to her placement, the reason why she has brought her hips close to the wall, to transfer it over to press down by the feet.

They probably didn't have a ton of intention with what to do with their feet. And they were on a really good right hand, so as they were pulling, it pulled way off of that foot and it slipped. So it was not a very effective body position. Here we have the start position. Left hand on what looks to be kind of like a rounded sloping jug. So it's not a sharp jug, it's kind of bulbous. Those can be kind of difficult to grab sometimes. And this right hand is definitely on a proper sloper and a high left foot. So the climber is really pulling with this left toe and this left arm will lock off in order to kind of get into this space with the hips.

Think of it as a clamp. Now the climber must remain to keep the elbow down to create friction when sustaining the grip. Now as the climber is working on moving quickly before getting to the left hand hold, climber had placed his left foot and kept the right leg extended and pressed down and pressed with the toe against the wall to generate power for his stance as well as bringing his hips close to the wall. Here the climber has been able to release the right foot out of place after placing pressure on the left foot. As we can see, he needs to make sure that he brings his center of gravity underneath the hold that's been held above him. This in order to then, after making the right foot placement, the climber can release the left hand to the next handhold. The climber has a two-hand hold start. The top grip, the climber must create pressure by leaning on the hold and pressing it towards him as he is at the same time engaging the left-hand grip on an undercling, meaning that there is a jug that is positive and seems to be placed upside down, where the climber must slide the fingers underneath the hold. In order to sustain this hold, the climber must create a pulling position towards him the way that the climber is compressing the move when making the foot placement. This time the climber has placed the right foot on a foot chip and once the climber gets to bring the left foot out of the mat, then the climb will start. As the climber went up for the reach, you can see he was able to make the hand placement, but wasn't able to apply friction, reason why the right hand has slipped out of place. This was also due to the leg that was out on the flag. He then was struggling in making a foot placement and had send it behind him, driving the force of gravity down, not helpful for the climbers making the right hand placement up to the block. The climber has sent the left hand to come into place to match the right hand hold. This one, it's called a jug. And so since this one has a big lip, the climber is able to wrap his hands around it to sustain the grip. However, the climber has pulled into the hole engaging more pressure onto the grips and the climber has lost applying pressure on the left foot when making the placement of the left hand. This can compromise the climber from over gripping and tiring the upper body just the beginning of the climb. So in order for the climber to get back into the wall, you would need to engage his core to make a foot placement down below. You can see the climber bringing his left foot placement to place the toe above the hand hold grip. This one being an undercling. In this instance the climber right now will have to continue to create pressure by pulling on the hold while pressing down the toe against the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So they're really swinging hips right to left to right with the goal of releasing at the apex of this jump so that they can catch the hold. And again, it's just kind of reward climbing. The dino that they do at the end is straightforward, and because the climber is tall enough, this is not a very difficult move. Great use of bringing the second hand up immediately to get over the top of the hold.

If this straightens out a little bit more, the climber has plenty of ape to get between both. I think that would be something worth trying.

So I was able to back down onto that jug, recollect and gain an intention for how to do the finish move, or this finish sequence, I should say. And here they are executing that. And after that sequence, the climber is able to come into this jug off of the second hold in the sequence. So committing to that heel hook, the climber comes in and does a quick match on this hold. Mostly just to open up the hips, to bring the hips from over here to over here, and then back over to get into this right hand here. And after regaining the left hand on the finish hold, the climber is just unable to muster the energy required to get the match in and they just fall off and hopefully get to try again. And after achieving the finish hole with their left hand, the climber just didn't quite know what to do with the feet, so they're now backing down to this jug, which is a good tactic if you get overwhelmed and you do have the option to back down into a jug. So the climber takes that here. Climber then is able to roll out to the finish hold here. They are generally confused as to how to get through this sequence. They looked like they were maybe going to try and hand heel match or hand toe hook match. They decided against that. This is the left hand that they were on, which I know this hold, it's a pretty in-cut, like 20mm edge. And this hold here is an old voodoo sloper, a little half moon action. It's not the best hold in the world, but it's not terrible. And the climber is just figuring out how to get from over here to underneath it over here, which is a pretty tough transition for the climber. Here we have a sit start matched on a jug here. Left hand relatively high, at least for the size of the climber. And looking up at the first hold. After matching this hold, the climber campuses the feet out and are able to get some higher feet here, which were handholds from the previous sequence. Now the climber has a left hold on this crimp rail here, and looking down at what to do with the feet. And after matching this hold with the feet, the climber was able to match this blue hold down here and make a big stand up move to this down pulling jug here. So you can see the climber is pretty stretched out. It doesn't require a ton of core tension. I think all the holds that the climber is on are very good. And this is also just a huge foothold so the climber should be able to maintain a relaxed composure through this. Climber goes up left hand into this jug-like hold and then opts for this inside heel hook. This climber uses an unorthodox technique, just like in general, and this inside heel hook is just a little weird. Ideally the climber would probably either not use a heel hook or get it outside so that the climber can open up their hips a little bit and shoulder in to this left hand hold. But nevertheless, the climber is on two jugs so it doesn't really matter.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It is a rather small little edge. So it really is gonna encourage him to go left hand at first for this move and Pinch with the right hand and generate from that right hand because that that pinch that little crimp right here is so small And we can see that he hits the hole but just isn't able to hold it. It looks like maybe something with accuracy so he may be onto something and then just kind of getting this move down a little better but so right now he's you know he's hitting the hole but he's just not able to latch it and keep the keep the tension there. I think this one is more about accuracy. He had the right idea, moved the right way but just wasn't able to grab the hold in the right spot and I think that's what's going to kind of come down to this problem is you have this hole that's more accurate so you want to move more slow.

Here we can see how the climber continues to glance over at the hold at reach and has already swung over to the right and pushed forcefully onto the left foot as he's no longer having contact with the hold. This is once the climber has reached the chest height where the grips are, then he pulls himself into the wall. This is so that the center of gravity follows his body when performing the jump. The climbers is starting at a two hand hold start and as we can see he's applying the grip at the bottom area of the hold The type of hold he's sustaining is rounded with a hold on the inside. This type of hold is called a donut and where the climber gets to place the fingers as far in inside of the hold since there is a groove and Presses down on the fingertips as well as on the thumb placed on the outside in order to secure the grip. As we can see the climber is doing a step up start where he places the feet on to the wall and once the climbers placements are secured Then the climber starts The climber had pushed forcefully on the right hand before releasing it and immediately after the release the climber's right foot was engaged to boost the jump. He is now with flying for a quick fraction of a second and it is important that the climber knows exactly when to boost the move. For this case the climber was making himself close to the wall when pulling himself into the wall but once engaging into the right foot the climber due to rotating his right shoulder out to go out for the reach, his center of gravity was slightly thrown out away from the wall when boosting the right foot for the move. The climber is aiming is the term that we use for glancing over to the hold at reach since he will be performing a dyno and where he's right now building momentum by swinging while he had lowered his center of gravity. This is to keep the feet at a high foot placement and when the climber is ready then he will swing over to that direction at reach and we'll have to press forcefully onto the left foot in order to get that direction and push over with force to spring out of the move. When the climber gets to reach a certain height of the chest reaching by where the grips are he will pull himself towards the wall. This is so that he can drive the center of gravity close to the wall and underneath the hold at reach.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She kind of skips this undercling for this different beta. But I think the problem is she's trying to pull too hard on this foot because she's not going to be able to do this move statically. This hand is like directly over the foot. So what she's got to do is kind of shift her weight over this foot and then go up or apply that pressure downwards. So what she needs to do is use the right leg and smear it into the wall and have that push her to the left so that she can stand up to the hold. So you can see the moment that her foot kind of pops off. So she's still quite low. And it looks like most of this is being generated with the right arm. So her weight's still so far to the right. So when she toes in through here, it's just slipping off. So this is where that right foot kind of pushing her more to the left is going to come into play.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Instead of going for the high foot, they're just very focused on the lower position so they can still do the move, but it's an overly extended position and it's less efficient. So again, we see the climber kind of struggling to find the right foot position. One of the challenges we see with this is actually that they're such a tall climber, there's a tendency to keep the feet really low because they're able to keep the feet in a lower position while they keep reaching. However, for this climber, it seems that it creates kind of this tendency to have to reposition and fish for other footholds and just take more time on the wall. So even though they're able to continue climbing, it's just not very efficient. Climber is able to establish on the problem and they do the first several moves with pretty good pacing. It's a little difficult because the judge is pointing out the holds with the laser pointer as they move and that takes away some of the sequencing aspect from the climber. One of the things that we kind of intend to test in this kind of problem is their ability to memorize the sequence. So it's tough to gauge their ability on that climb for that skill when that's getting pointed out to them. Good coordination on this movement here with shake out and the kind of discus toss where the climber throws the arm as they reach up and pivot the hip to get into the next position. So there's good timing on that move. So there's a lot of foot swapping here where the climber is unable to figure out which position they want to be able to stay in to make this next move. They're coming into the right position here at the end with the right foot and right hip in, but this is looks like the climber basically needs to sequence and plan out more before beginning because they're looking just kind of lost repositioning their feet on the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Now as we can see the climber has dropped the right foot and this helps the climber to bring her center of gravity between the grips as she is glancing over to the next hold that reach. The climber is glancing down at the feet again to perform a foot switch where she brought the left toe to come into contact slightly with the foot hold before releasing the right foot from its place. There wasn't sufficient space for both of the feet to be on the hold so the climber had swiveled the right foot out to make slightly some space in the moment that she dropped the right foot. Then she swiveled hard and applied pressure onto the left toe coming into place. Now the right foot being extended and she drops it is to bring her center of gravity again between the grips. The climber was able to recover the move by making the left foot placement and in order to make the reach the climber has to turn the left side of the body towards the wall by turning the toe inwards to be pressed towards the inner edge of the toe as The climber pull onto the right hand to twist the body to bring the left shoulder up To bring the left hand up for the next hold that reach It's important the climber always glances down at the feet to secure the foot placement and this one she applies the right toe to come into place at a high foot placement. As soon as the climber applies pressure onto the foot then she will be able to release the left foot that is out in distance and in doing so she will be able to transfer the weight to the highest foot being in place. The climber quickly had repositioned her right foot by again Jumping the foot further in to place the ball of the foot towards the edge of the hold and as soon as she secured that Foot placement. She's now lowering her center of gravity And extending the left leg The leg extended is called flagging out So the climber is able to transfer the weight to the right foot being in place And at this moment the climber is leaning back on the grips so that she's able to once lowering her center of gravity Make herself move over to the left side so that she is able to Be ready to commit to the move out reach as it would be dynamic the left leg extended the climber will then use it to balance over her main areas of support and And once she will be performing the reach she will then tap the left foot towards the wall to Boost her move to that direction that reach As we can see the climber was able to make the next hold at reach and had kept the right leg extended this is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place and It helps the climber with keep balance over the move The climber is glancing down. This is so once the climber had made the right hand placement, she can readjust the grip by feel to make sure that she is able to secure the grip. Now as the climber glances down, she would be able to look over to the next move that she will have to place for her right foot coming into place. It is important how the climber gets to position her body on the wall. In this case, once the climber had brought the right foot into place, we can see how the right knee is pointing inwards and that helps the climber to keep her right side of the body towards the wall when performing the reach. The climber had brought the left foot to come into a high foot placement but glancing over to the next holder at reach the climber performs a foot switch to instead bring her right foot to come into place and the type of foot switch that she performed was a jump off jump on. The climber is right now demonstrating controlling the stability over the move while performing the match. In doing so, the climber then has completed the climb. The climber in performing the foot switch, her foot had slipped out of the hold so the climber at this moment is sustaining tightly onto the grips on a match. And the way to control the swing, the climber must continue to apply tension on the upper body by performing a pull up, engaging onto the core in order to pick up the feet to bring it back onto the placement. As the climber needed to continue to apply pressure onto that left hand grip, she continues to lay back and had made a high foot placement of the right toe over a large hold. Immediately the climber, after applying pressure, was able to release the left foot from its place. The climber was able to recover the move by pushing onto that left toe towards the hole to pull herself in. And once she gained stability, she quickly is performing a foot switch. As we can see, the climber quickly after bringing herself in, uses that momentum of the pull-in and do a foot switch to drop the weight onto the right toe coming into place. Once the climber was able to gain a civility over the move by applying pressure and adjusting the foot placement, she then pulls herself in by pushing on the toe to bring her center of gravity back onto the wall. Keeping the right leg extended is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place and it also helps when the climber gets to perform the next move. Now the climber has released the left hand from its place and she is shaking it. This will help to release any tension that may have been built up on the grip and having the right arm extended. This is called a rest position so the climber is not engaging on the arm muscle on the pull up and this helps the climber to have recovery during this time. The climber right now is starting at a one hold start where she's placing both of the hands onto the same hold. This is called matching and as we can see this is a positive hold because the climber is able to wrap the fingers around the edge of the hold which this type of hold would be called a jug. As we can see the climber is in her first position before starting the climb so because it's no longer on the mat and has the feet placed at a high foot stance where she right now is dropping the weight and extending the arms to perform the next move at reach. \ub05d A climber easily dropping the weight between the grips and dropping the right foot helped with gaining stability when making the transition of the left hand over to the next hold at reach. Because this was a dynamic move, the climber's right foot has dropped back, bringing the center of gravity away from the wall. So it's important that the climber continues to press onto that left toe placement to recover the move. The climber after resting quickly pushes down on the foot and pulls on the hand to make a rotation of the shoulders towards the wall to send the hand over to the next hold at reach. The climber is able to land the grip because she can cup the top area of the hold, being a jug, to land the weight immediately after being placed. The climber continues to glance down at the feet. This is because she's performing a foot switch and the type of technique that she uses is by bringing the left toe over the right toe right before she pulls out the right foot from its place. As soon as she does that, she will then immediately place pressure with landing the left toe over the hold. This is a technique that could easily go wrong and has to be done timely. So if the climber does not land the foot in place immediately, she could miss the hold as well as she could accidentally pull the left foot out of place when she removes the right foot. The climber has walked over the left hand over to the right side of the hold. This is because the climber eventually will be releasing the right hand from its place as the climber is glancing over to the right side. We can see that dropping the foot helps the climber to transfer the weight to the left foot being in place. So when the climber makes the move the climber can then gain the stability and balance over the move with the right leg extended.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And after getting the foot into that blocked start hold jug, the climber was able to cross over left into this hold here and then get their left foot in on that first hold in the sequence looking out right for the next hold. Here we have the Climber 1 move in on this boulder. They started matched on this hold here and this left foot that they're on now. It then busts up to a pretty similar hold with the left hand. This is an interesting blocking situation. It would be great if this yellow hold wasn't here so that you could just dunk a heel in on the above or below the hand. Because this yellow hold is here, it blocks the ability to get into it with your foot from this position. Pretty interesting. I don't dislike it, but it is a factor in this move. The climber is then able to go out right into this hold, which is a large surface area jug. So you have to have a really big hand to get into it, and most people end up just being able to grab basically the very edge of it, so it acts kind of like a sloper. And again, trying to figure out where the feet are, the climber gets their left foot in on this pink jug, and then is able to proceed up the wall. And after the climber chills on this hold for a while trying to figure out what foot is on Definitely getting pumped the climber is able to pounce up into this jug and it's a good thing. It is a jug because I think the The climber just didn't know what foot was on and this is a very natural phenomenon on a wall with this many holds on it And when you're not competing you just drop off and take a look But when you're competing you have to try and send every attempt And so yeah, you could say that the climber didn't Study what was on on the boulder. You could say that The laser pointer person wasn't doing an accurate job. Either way. The climber is probably more tired than they would be", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

They're still bunched up here in the right arm so there's a chance they could open up that right arm and shift the hips a little bit further to the left and it seems like they could probably keep the start hold and gain target hold here.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And then when she has the left hand, she should be able to spring up and extend out that left foot to pinpoint this left hand pinch. And then she'll be able to bring her feet up to the start jug. So then Emilio when she kind of goes into this position, it's so bad she's still trying to be underneath it. So she's not getting any height.

So in this position we can see that the climber is doing a good job of making sure that his arms are in a straight position while he's doing a good job of making sure that his legs are loaded up. So this does show that the climber understands that his legs are the main driving force to getting him up into this dynamic move. However, what I'm noticing is that as the climber is getting himself ready for this position, he's only made a small gesture of kind of like moving from side to side and what's more important is that the climber should be kind of swinging himself from left and right. So then that way he can get a good understanding of the shifting that's going on from his left foot over to his right foot because ultimately as he's completing this dyno, the climber should be pushing with his left leg to transition a lot of his body weight over to the right and then ultimately his right foot is going to be the main foot that's going to be driving him upwards into this dynamic move. And so because the climber is kind of only letting himself go kind of up and down, he's only doing like half the movement, so it doesn't really show that the climber has a good understanding of how to transition his body weight over onto that right foot to be able to complete this boulder properly. And so here we can see the clamber is reaching up with his right hand up into this next handhold here And so what I'm noticing in this position here is the clamber's right leg is off of the wall and it's kind of making itself slowly Rotating outwards into the right while his left foot is kind of going upwards Um, so what that's kind of telling me is a couple things is that he's mainly focusing on his left foot being the main Driving force of pushing him up on this wall However, that kind of limits him because he's he's he's only limited to how far he can he can push himself with that left foot But if you were to push and focus on pushing with that right foot, this would actually help him out greatly Because it doesn't actually place him a little bit closer to that hold he's aiming for because it is a slightly to the right So if he were to focus on pushing more with his right foot This would allow him to kind of get himself closer and into a better position of grabbing onto the screen hold for the dynamic move", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This is unfortunately pretty common with some of these cross under moves where you have to be very careful not to bump the higher arm off. One of the ways around this is to just cross over instead of under. That actually can push the dominant arm into the hold even further, but here the climber just makes the mistake of bumping their hand off of the hold that they're on. We have the climber one move in on this boulder. They're matched on what was the right hand start hold. Started in a hand foot match where their left hand was down here and they brought their left foot up. So they're into the boulder and progressing up the wall. The climber then comes up to this green pinch, kind of deliberates whether they want to go right foot or left foot on this hold. And that is essentially them deciding whether or not they want to go right hand or left hand into this purple hold. They decide to bump past the green hold and go left hand up to the purple pinch.

Her eyes are also facing towards the left side of the room. She should be twisting her body forward and this should be inclusive of her shoulders, her chest, her hips, her waist, her knees. Everything should be facing forward. The dancer takes very small steps here when she's moving horizontally to her left. She should be taking larger steps and covering more ground. The dancer's right foot also should be lifted off the ground. So her right leg should be angled further away from her body and off the ground. To be able to do that better, she could also bend her left knee more so that her body is lower to the ground and then her right leg in an oppositional force should be pulling away from the center of her body. Also, a way in which that could help her get lower to the ground is if she widened her legs more, and that would mean her bringing her left foot further away towards the left side of the room, so that her feet instead would be wider apart. By that I mean the dancer should be lower to the ground. She needs to bend her knees so that she's lowered.

Here the climber has made the move up to the next hold and has sent the hand palming over what's a look like a slight diagonal pinch. Now the climber is not holding on to this hold necessarily the right way so that is the reason why the climber is having a hard time to grabbing onto the hold and to do this the climber needs to release some pressure from the hand above to readjust it so the climber at this time is pushing down hard and sending up onto that heel hook as well as pulling and bringing into a hard pull up to release the pressure from the hand. At the same time we can see how the flagging out as a climber gains leverage the leg is being dropped with this toe pointing down. Here it's good of the climber to always be glancing over to the feet. Especially in this position, the climber feels not at a great stance, so needs to extend the stance. In this case, the climber glances down and what he's doing is doing a foot hop where he will hop the left foot out while bringing the right foot into the same foot chip. The foot chip is very small, so the climber must engage the upper body in order to release some pressure down at the feet. And without losing the feet in the slip, then the climber quickly needs to do this in control to release the left foot and let the right foot come into place. Here we can see the climber quickly moving over to the left side as soon as he places the right foot against the wall. This foot is not in any foot chips but instead is used to be extended out and the climber is pushing towards the wall to help the climber extend over to the left side. Once the climber extends the leg the climber will be able to stand up and over the foot that is being placed to gain leverage. Here the climber spent already so much time with going up to the reach on the hold before and then knowing that he couldn't make the hand adjustment he goes for the next hold on route. This one is called bumping up when the same hand has already gone up once and is going for a second time up to the next hold. Here we can see the climber fully standing on the heel hook that was in height placement. As we can see the climber has folded the leg because it will help the climber to create more pressure and stability while in the heel hook position. And the left leg when pointing out right and is extended at this moment which is performing a back flagging because it's folded behind the right leg. The leg that is extended being the left leg is right now used for balance as the climber needs to lean back on the hold that's been supported. So the right side at this moment, the right hand and the right foot is the one that is the base of support. In the back flag which is the left leg being out behind it is sent out for stability so that the climber can bring his center of gravity as close as he can to the base of support. Here we can see the climber has swept feet down below and brought the right foot into a higher stance. This one by placing the heel in on top of the hold first rather than the toe. This is called a heel hook and heel hooks are known to be really strong as it can does as it can do a motion of pulling and almost used as a third hand. Since the climber will be able to push down on the heel and pull towards the climber this is considered to be really strong as is using the thigh muscle during its use. Here we can see the climber chucking up his hands. This will help the climber to have a better grip when on the wall, as well as absorbing any sweat that may be coming from his hands. Here the body position that the climber is on is on the left leg being extended. It's called flagging out. Now the climber will be gaining reach and by stepping up on the right toe. The right toe right now is placed on a foot chip and as we can see the climber has brought the right leg to be pointing out left. This one the knee pointing out left and this will help the climber to keep the right side close to the wall since the right hand is the one going out for the reach and supported to bring his center of gravity close to the wall is the leg that's on flag where he will be using the toe to tap against the wall to support bringing the hips close to the wall when making the stance. Here we can see the climber having difficulties when reaching out left. This is due to the knee being on the way of when he's crunching up to make the reach out left being a pinch. Now this situation of having high foot placement is good for the climber to think to keep it in place when making the next move as well. Not only going for the first move out of the starting hold. But even though he's having a hard time with bringing himself close to the wall due to the leg being in front of him is due to his height. And it's something that the climber then would have to push through by making a pull up position and really engaging into a hard pull up in order to reach out left. While the right foot was being extended and tapping against the wall to bring himself over to the left side. Here we can see the climber starting with a one hold start, meaning that both hands will be placed in the same hold. In this case the climber does by positioning the hands crossed. The top one will be the one that it will be moving out next as the climber glances over to the left. He's positioned the right hand to be closer to the other hold that is at reach, which is a choice of the climber when thinking about the body movement. We can see how the climber also has brought up the left foot in a higher placement and it's already pressing on the hold. However the climber yet to start since it's touching the ground with the right foot. Once the right foot is placed on the wall then the climber starts and then the climber will be able to come off from the starting hold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It's important that the climber glances over to about like one, two, three moves ahead before performing a move. This is called reading the sequence and if the climber has sent the wrong hand over to the hold that she had sent then the climber will have to spend some time and energy to be repositioned. That's why it's important to before starting to climb to glance over and make a plan. It's important the climber always glances down when making a new foot placement. On this one the climber after pressing into the right toe and raising the hips had transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. Now the left foot is the one that is being pressed so the climber while sustaining the grips brings the right foot at a higher stance. If the climber was to perform this again, it's important that she plans from the ground before getting onto the wall the moves that she will need to perform. However, sometimes the climber might encounter themselves in the moves that they wanted to perform and it seems to not feel good. And so down climbing is an option, but the climber needs to do this with control, especially if it's a move that was dynamic, it'll be much harder to down climb. The climber is starting at a one-hold start where both hands are in the same hold. This is called matching and the type of hold she is sustaining to is a large one with a lip where the climber can wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold being a positive grip. Now the climber is placing the right foot onto a large foothold and when the climber is placing the other foot then she will no longer be standing on the mat. Then the climb will start. The climber was retracting the move that she had just performed and this is called down climbing. However the climber did not get to position the left foot towards the wall to control her detachment of the left hand that was out at reach. This one because the climber will go out in a swing and having only one foot placed onto the wall would have been very difficult to sustain her swing reason why the climber had landed onto the mat. The climber after making the right toe placement onto the foothold, we can see how she had brought the right knee to come inwards. This is so that she was able to keep her right side of the body close to the wall as the direction that the climber needs to sustain the hold above. She would need to lay back underneath the hold and towards the right side. Due to the climber wanting to stay close to the wall to manage the center of gravity, to stay close, she has released the left foot to transfer the weight to the right foot being in place. The climbers next move is at reach and sends the left hand to land the grip over to the left side of the hold. Now because the climbing is sending the left hand over the right arm this is called a crossover move and the climber was also able to extend the left side of the body by pressing down onto the right foot to raise the hips.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

In this point, the climber had brought into a very close pull up so that she can bring her center of gravity close to the wall when going out for the reach. The climber right now is staring at the next hold at reach and we can see her extending the left leg and the arms to lean back. Now the climber being able to press onto the left toe is what brings her center of gravity underneath the grips. And as the climber is staring at the hold at distance is because the climber is lowering his center of gravity in order to perform a dynamic move next since the hold is at reach. The climbers are starting at a one-hole start where she places both of the hands onto the same hold. This is called matching and the climber is placing the hand to be wrapped around the lip of the hold as this is a positive hold being a jug and when it's really large, it's also called a bucket. This type of holds is mostly seen on beginner climbs as they are do not require a lot of energy to sustain on the grip. the climber performing the reach we can see how she yet to apply the grip over the lip of the hold and in doing so the climber's left foot has popped out of place. This was due to a lack of pressure when sending her hand over to the reach. It is important that if the climber was to attempt this again that she applies pressure of the left foot and in this case potentially the climber was placing the foot over to the right side of the hold and if she places the foot next time it needs to be done over the corner of that hold so that the climber will be able to roll the toe on top of the hold to apply pressure when transitioning out left. As we can see the climber first has thrown herself over to the right and quickly has dropped her center of gravity to extend the arms. This is because the climber is going to be performing a jump up to the hold at reach where she brings the center of gravity low to apply more pressure onto the feet when she gets to stand up and pull herself into the wall. So the climber is no longer standing on the mat and has placed the feet onto the holes of the wall. That means that the climber once off the mat then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

But if you pay attention to the first person image right here, we can see that they're basically touching the good side of the hold with their fingertips right there. So they're not exactly using it quite yet. But in this position, we can see that they're hanging on with their right hand. They do have a left foot that's behind their body, it's just kind of blocked in the image right here. And they're still using the right foot right here. And so because they're shifting their body weight over to the left right there, we can kind of see that they're limited in the full reach. Because the distance that we want to look at is the distance from their right foot to the left hand, which is the greatest distance that points from each other. And so because the climber is keeping the right foot on the foothold as they're completing this movement, they're realizing that they're coming up short and they're unable to really reach the good side of the hold that they're aiming for. So what I would always recommend climbers is to not become guilty of always relying on two feet being placed on the wall at every time. Because as we can see here, as climbers relying on two feet being present on the wall, it's forcing them to be short on their movement. And as a result, they're having to pull and engage with the arm a little bit more as they're hanging in this position right here to try and figure out how to get the rest of the movement. So what I would always encourage climbers is before even really committing to the next hand movement is by placing, in this case, they would be placing their right foot off of the foothold. And it would be turning into a flagging foot that would be kind of extended out into the wall. So that way they can kind of press and rotate their body over their left foot, and then they would get the full distance that they need instantly as opposed to trying to hang in this position to get the rest of the movement going. And so here we can see the Clown was able to move their left hand over into the next hand hold here and in this position we can see that they were using a right hand here as well as a right foot and they do have a left foot that we can kind of see a little bit right here. So in the same instance from their opening move we can kind of see another triangle of position right here. Right, so between the three points of contact and now we can see that their body is shifted to the left of that position right there. So it's always making, always important to make sure that you have a really good balance of what's going on with your body right here. So because the climber is moving over to the left it's okay to shift their body weight in the direction that they need to but as soon as they grab on to that next hold because they're grabbing on with that left hand now the triangle turns over into this block right here that I'm kind of zigzagging into. So now the triangle is shifted over to the left and they need to balance their points in that triangle right there. So what this climber needs to make sure they do is they get off of that right foot and turn it into a flagging foot so then that way they can keep the majority of the body weight between their left foot and the two hands that they're utilizing and this allows them to kind of move the right foot into the next position continuing the movement. And so here we can see the Clammer is making the final move of bringing the left hand over into this finish hold here. And in this position we can see that they're hanging on with their right hand here and they're still using a right foot right here. So because again they're using two points of contact that are on the same side of the body, it does make them in an imbalanced position so we can kind of see that what they're flagging for it's kind of taking a toll on them because it's kind of getting kicked out away from the wall here. So this foot because it's flagging out away from the wall, it actually helps to further pull them away from the wall. So if this Clammer was more tired or utilizing harder holds, this could result in them falling. Luckily it does seem for this Clammer they're very usable holds to finish on. So that's probably why this Clammer is okay with doing it in this form. So I would always recommend Clammers to really have good control of their body and their flagging foot before committing to hand moves just because if they just commit to a hand move it could cause them to become imbalanced and could lead to a fall. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring their right hand over so they're now matched onto the same handhold. But one thing that I'm noticing about this position is the climber is doing a good job of making sure that their left arm is in a very straight position, but what we can see is that a lot of their body weight is kind of hanging out and away from the wall. One of the reasons why I think that is is the climber might be comfortable with the handhold that they're using, but what I'm also seeing is kind of a lack of really adjusting their body weight over their right foot, just because that's the one foot that's on a foothold on the wall. So what I would definitely recommend the climber is kind of adjusting their body all the way more to the right, so then that way they can put more body weight on top of that right foot, and then that way instead of hanging out and away from the wall, they can allow their body to hang down underneath the hold, which would make it feel better, and that way they can place more body weight on their right foot altogether. So here we can see the climber was able to make the first move of bringing her right hand up into the next handhold here and the way the climber was able to do that was by using this left hand here and then we can see that they are using both a left foot as well as a right foot on the wall right here. So one thing I want to point out right here is because where their left hand is placed it's basically right in the middle of the two of the points which is their two other feet so what this does is it causes a natural balance in the climber just because they're very stationed they're very in a controlled position right here and if we think about it they're almost kind of creating a triangle shape with their body right between the three points we have from their hand to the left foot from the foot to the opposite foot and from their hand again to the right foot. So these lines kind of create a triangle and the idea is to always try and maintain this triangle of balance between three points of contact because ideally one points will be always moving on the wall just to kind of progress them on the wall. So here in this starting position we can see that the climber is in a very balanced position because their hand is in the middle of their two feet and this really helps to allow them to get good control and availability of moving on into the next move. So as we see them move up with that right hand into the next position we can see that the body is still stationary in the same position right here which just goes to show how much control they have as opposed to if they were to move one hand into the next position sometimes you can kind of see their body transition from one side to the next and that just kind of shows that they weren't in a good triangle or a good balanced position before continuing into this movement here but for this first move we can see that this climber wasn't really moving around that much once they made that move so just goes to show how controlled they were in this position. And so here we can see in the rest of that movement of reaching over to the left that the climber is now able to fully grasp onto that left hand there. And only after the climber is able to fully grab onto that left hand there we can see that their right foot is now off the foothold in a flagging position here. So this is ideally where I would want the climber to be with their flagging foot before even committing to that hand move. So then that way they can help conserve a little bit more energy and fully trust their left foot to be able to get them over into the move that they need. Obviously this is a little bit more of something to practice for kind of every climber because it is a very valuable tool that helps especially short climbers but can even help tall climbers to make sure that they can reach and fully weight their foot so then that way they're not slipping on any foothold. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing their left hand up into the next handhold here. And in this position we can see that the climber was hanging on with a right hand here, as well as their left foot in the main position. And we can see that the right foot did turn into a flagging foot. So that flagging foot just kind of helps to really rotate the body around that left foot. So then that way they can push off that left foot and get the amount of movement that they need. And so in this position we can see that the climber made a good rotation with their lower body so that the left side of their hip gets closer to the wall. So this is a really good use of their lower body into ensuring that they're using more of the lower body as opposed to pulling so much with their upper body. But we can see that the climber is still pulling in with their right arm there. So I would just kind of encourage them to really rotate their body a little bit more so that way they can help reduce the amount of upper body pulling that they're doing right here. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing their left hand up into the next handhold here. And in this position we can see that the climber was hanging on with the right hand here as well as utilizing a right foot in this position here. Now, so because they're using two points of contact that are on the same side of the wall, again, which is the right hand and right foot, this kind of creates them in an imbalanced position. And what tends to want to happen is their body wants to rotate out and to the right, essentially around those two points. And that's because they have a lot of body weight that's to the left and naturally balance always wants to take place. And what that balance is, is their body wants to rotate over to the right around those two points. So what we can see is as the climber is reaching up with their left hand, their left foot is in a flagging position. And right now their flagging position is kind of down in this position right here. So I would actually not encourage a flagging position in this angle right here, just because it's keeping them in that narrow position as well within the right hand and right foot. So what I would actually encourage them is to flag their left leg over to the right on the right side of the two points that they're making contact with the wall. So then that way they can help distribute a little bit of their body weight over to the right. So then that way they feel less rotation going on in their body. But what we can see is because the climber is having their left foot flagging down into the middle, they are having to engage the right arm ever so slightly to try and pull them up into the next movement here. So because they're using two points on the same side of the body, they're being forced to use a little bit more energy and a little bit more tools in order to make sure that they can accomplish this movement here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

We can see how the climber's left hand was trying to go over the orange hold, the one that was for the start instead of moving over to the next hold at reach. The climber is pressing forcefully on the feet. This is to release some of the pressure at the grips. And as we can see, the climber was able to release the left hand grip. The climber was securing the left hand placement. He keeps the arm extended. This is so that the climber can have some time for recovery and transferring over the weight to the left hand grip. As we can see he only placed a few fingers inside of the hold, being the middle finger, ring and index finger. Those are the strongest fingers on the hand and is pressing onto the right toe against the hold, driving the right knee inwards. This is so the climber can then make the transition of releasing the right hand over to the next hold at reach. The climber had glanced down at the feet to make sure he made an accurate foot placement, making the placement of the left toe towards his small foot chip and his place much lower than the right foot that had come into place much higher. Once the climber is off the mat, then the climb will start. The climber releasing the left hand grip, he then has missed the pressure and position of the right hand immediately dropping the weight. It will be really hard for the climber to recover the move. However, the climber is bringing the right hand over the left hand to be placed. He needs to ensure to apply pressure mostly into the left side of the hold and not so much pressure where it traps the left hand. So that way the climber can release the left hand from its place. It is important that the climber starts moving the feet slightly higher to release some of the pressure of the grips before he performs the move at reach. The climber is readjusting the right hand grip potentially not being the best placement due to the right hand being placed above the left hand making it hard to release when commuting for the next move. The climbers is starting at a two hand hold start placing the left hand over the right hand. For the left hand the climber is sustaining to a much larger hold. As we can see he's placing the fingers onto the right side so he must pull the hold onto the left direction in order to apply pressure. As for the right hand grip the climber places it from underneath the right hand and as we can see he's using the fingertips to be placed over the edge of the hold with the thumb pressed onto the side. With the palm being placed over the hold. This type of grip is called an open hand grip so the climber will be folding the knuckles to apply force at the finger pads. The climber has little contact of the right hand once he applies pressure only at the fingertips. It is important that the climber brings the right hand's elbow close to the wall to apply pressure pulling it downwards. As we can see the climber has brought the right hand to come into a match at the hold. Matching is when both of the hands are placed in the same hold. And presses the thumb onto the outer left side of the hold to place the fingers behind where the thumb is placed. The clamber was able to make the move at reach sending the left hand behind the lip of the hold. This is a rounded hole with a sharp edge and so this type of hold could be called different things. One could be a very small hueco because huecos are known to be big or a donut hold except that it's not rounded like a donut it has a sharp edge or in this case could be a pocket if the climber can only fit a few fingers and if the lip of the hold is shallow. In this case the climber is placing the fingers at the bottom lip of the hold and as we can see when committing into the move he released the left hand that was on the smaller hold which was hard to sustain and it makes sense that the climber was pulling onto the right hand grip being a pinch in a more positive hold to sustain as the climber had pressed down onto the feet to drive the hips close to the wall. The climber chooses to switch the hands to not have them cross over. This was because the left hand was being impeded by the right hand as he will have to make the move up next potentially releasing the left hand since this one is not the best hold to sustain for a long time and the one that is more reliable is the right hand. As we can see this time the climber is applying the right hand grip with the thumb placed onto one side of the hold and the fingers onto the other. To apply pressure the climber must squeeze onto the hold to provide power and pressure at the same time by pulling it back and for the left hand grip same way as a climber will have to press the fingers against a very small edge of the hold with a thumb pressed onto the outside being in an open crimp as a climber will have to drive the palm towards the hold and fold the knuckles to drive force onto the fingertips and to pull in the direction for sustaining the grip the climber must keep the elbow close to the wall to pull it down when transferring over the weight to the grips.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He then looks down, being extended at the feet, and needs to be purposeful the way that he switches his feet. So he brings the right foot to meet where the left foot is, and once he applies pressure with the right toe on the hold, then the climber will be able to release the left foot to the next stance. Here, in order for the climber to recover out of the swing, he must hold on to the grips tight and tense the body to not allow the swing to go completely out, peeling him off the wall. So, the climber must engage the core and this will be transferred down to the legs so that the climber is able to pick up the legs and make a foot placement as soon as he gains momentum on the swing back. The climber has brought the left foot down and it's important that the climber glances over to make an accurate placement of the feet. This one because the left foot is going to be taking place instead of the right foot. As we can see the climber is pulling on the grips to release some pressure down at the feet while making the switch. It's important that the climber is still activating some sort of pressure down at the feet as if he doesn't apply any pressure it will make the climber swing out of the wall. So as the climber is making the switch we can see how the left toe is being placed above the right toe. And this so that the climber in the moment he hops over the right foot can take place above the hold while releasing the right foot out of the placement. Here the climber was able to generate power on the pole to make the reach up to the next hold. As we can see the hold that the right hand is sustaining is a jug, so this seems as a positive hold and a promising hold too. The climber secured the grip once placing the hand. The left foot wasn't used in this instance to generate power on the stance, it just was helpful for the climber to keep himself still on the wall without cutting feet. As the climber had made the reach up to the pinch, this one placing the fingers on the outside and the thumb on the inside, this will make the climber generate power by squeezing on that hold, which is mostly generated with a lot of pressure with the thumb being on the opposite side where the fingers are placed. Now the climber must create pressure not only by squeezing the hold but also leaning onto the hold to create friction and maintain that stance. As the climber was going up for the reach, we can see how his right side is towards the wall and this will help the climber when obtaining the reach as he had made the stance on the right foot to gain height. Also it's important that the climber had kept the right side towards the wall, which he has made on the forceful pull up. Here the climber has made the move of the left hand up to the next hold. Now the climber is sending the right leg extended. This is called flagging out which helps the climber to shift the weight over to be placed on the foot placed down below as he made the stance. The flagging out helps the climber to keep balance when going out for the reach as he shifted the weight over to the foot supporting him when making the stance. Here the climber quickly after resting the arm he made a pull up move to release the left foot that was a distance and made the move up to the next hold, the right hand grip. As soon as that one was positioned we can see how the jug is so secured that the climber is able to hold it down below to pull himself into the wall as he was making the stance on the right foot. Now the climber has brought the left foot into placement and is glancing over to what the next move may be as he would need to bring his left hand at a higher stance. Since this is a rest position, the climber has sent his right hand down and is shaking it. This is to release any tension that the climber potentially has built up to this point. As soon as the climber is ready resting that arm, he will then place it back onto the hold. Here the climber is starting at a two hand hold start. The right hand being placed on a sloper, this means that the climber must maintain pressure by creating friction between the fingertips and creating weight by him leaning underneath the hold. Now the left hand is placed on a jug where the climber is able to curl the fingers behind it and pull the hold out in order to keep pressure. As we can see the climber has made a foot placement, right foot down on the foot chip and the left foot much elevated where he places the middle of the foot, outer edge, towards the hold. Now that the climber is off the mat then the climb has started. The climber here has sent the right hand to match at the last hold. Once the climber has sustained the hand placement for three seconds, then the climber has completed the problem. In order for the climber to make it to the last hold, the climber had engaged into a forceful pull up from his last hand placement, the left hand going again for another move up the sequence. He was able to place the hand above the hold and the fingers to slide behind the lip of that hold. This is called a jug, so the climber is able to sustain that positive grip and curls the fingers in order to engage the grip and pulling onto the hold. Now because the climber has now shifted the weight to the highest placed hand, we can see how the climber has lost touch of the right foot placement with the hold and is out on the swing. In order for the climber to sustain his swing, he must press down on the foot, that's the left foot. But in this case, if the climber's right foot is swinging, the left foot might come out of the swing as well, so the climber must apply tight grip in order to sustain cutting feet. The climber made a quick right foot placement at a higher stance and send the left hand to match the right hand on the jug. Now that the climber is in the secure grip, meaning that it's a big lip that sticks out, the climber can rely on the force of the grips and disengage the arms, meaning he's leaning back and this is count as a rest position as he's able to rest the shoulders as well while he glances over for the next moves. Here we can see how the climber was able to make the reach up with the left hand to the next hold. And in this one, the right foot has remained with the leg extended. This one is called flagging in. And the flagging position is to keep the climber stable when making the move and keep his hips close to the wall. This is because the climber needed to transfer the weight over to the highest foot. And where the climber has placed the foot by putting the bottom of the sole towards the middle of the foot. The climber must press down on the hold to gain height when at the reach. Here the climber has engaged in a forceful pull to make the right hand positioning to the pinch. As we can see, the climber was able to gain reach due to pressing down on the foot down below. And to maintain the grip, the climber is placing the fingers onto the right side of the hold and the thumb on the other. This to generate power by pressing into the hold. The thumb will help the climber generate pressure to maintain a clamp position onto that hold. And as the climber had brought himself in, blocking the move, now the climber is going to be able to lean on that hold above.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She does a good job of straightening her right arm above her head, but she should just hold it there a bit longer. The dancer's right foot is very close to her standing leg or her left leg. She should be moving this foot further away. She also, though, in combination with bending her knees more when she lands, should be jumping higher into the air. And bending her knees also helps that purpose too, because when she bends her knees right before she jumps, or in between the jumps, it also helps her catapult herself into the air. So she should be jumping both up and horizontally. The dancer takes very small jumps here horizontally side by side and should be traveling further in space taking up more space and having more autonomy in her steps The dancer should also be bending her knees more when she lands so that the range of motion looks bigger. It would look like she's jumping higher if she bends lower when she lands. And that also helps to prevent injury and absorbs the shock or coats her knees and protects her knees. Here the dancer should widen her legs more and bend her knees more so that the step is bigger. On these jumps backwards too, she could be traveling again further backwards. She's staying in a small area of the room.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She hit a position too quickly with these arms back. And so she wasn't on the beat anymore. And that's unfortunate because she immediately, again, she doesn't hold her shapes very long. And so she was early for the music. And that does happen from time to time. But that's the even more opportunity to hold that position until you can't anymore musically. But she immediately dropped it. And so it really looks like a mistake. And again, does not look clear. So because she did not come through on the side of her leg and her hip, in this moment, she has to like take time to then bring the hip back or the knee back up and it looks really awkward and clunky. And it makes it so that she has to do like two to three to four movements as she falls rather than just like one. You can also see that she's not lined up over her hand here, and that's because I don't think she's conceptualizing this as her hand being a point of contact that she needs to put weight into. The weight needs to be right up over, the shoulder needs to be lined up right over the elbow, right over the wrist. So it looks like this was meant to be a body roll, but again she doesn't quite understand how to articulate very well through her spine yet, and so it again looks super stiff. You can see that her gaze is still forward, and so we get this sort of like breakage in the lines of her body. Let me draw that a little bit better. So we get a sort of an angle this way, we get an angle this way, and then we get this angle as well, and then these angles of these elbows. So it looks very stiff and angular, whereas a body roll is meant to look very smooth and undulating. So how she could do better with this is as she comes up, start with by gazing upwards, and then allowing that upward gaze to come forward to the position it's in now as the rest of the spine follows suit in a snake-like pattern. Another thing that's not helping is she's really jutting her pelvis forward here, and her weight is on the balls of her feet. It's really hard to do a spinal articulation from that position. It's better to have flat feet and a little bit of a soft knee, a little plie. So here she's done a great job of doing a nice deep plie and these arms are really nice, very specific energy out the fingertips. The issue is that she's kept her head in the same orientation through the previous two movements with her arm and this movement, so it detracts from the nice shape she's doing with the arms and legs. This would be much more effective if she looked up at her hands here in this moment. So this arm was up, it came down to her pubic bone and then upwards, but she never like fully finishes and follows through with this movement. You can see it just ends with this elbow upwards. It looks really, really awkward. I would love to see this fully unfold and come back up again before bringing it down to the next moment. Great footwork, good job staying in the balls of her feet. That helps her to keep the movement small, efficient, and quick and smooth, which is really nice. I wish that she wasn't bending at the wrist here so much. It's just a little too tense. It's not coming across as strong. It's coming across as tense. Unfortunately, she's again, she's kind of gotten to this sort of holding position that looks like a transition moment. It's not very strong. So I want her to continue dancing through her transitions rather than treating them as transitions. Better job with the attack of the arms coming down around and up. Pretty good energy out the fingertips and straight elbows. I love that she's way up high on the balls of her feet. It gives the whole movement an energy of upwardness which is really really nice and suited well to this style of dance and to this choreography. So again, the initiation of this movement is a little bit, is not sharp enough, but also the elbow, she's moving it out and up, and so it gives it more of a curved pathway, which is further making this movement look less sharp than it needs to be. Again, lack of clarity with the arms. She brings them down quickly, but in a sort of a flailing way, rather than a controlled way, and doesn't hold the shape. And so it doesn't read very well. It's kind of like, what was the point of that movement? It's kind of just here and then gone. So it's not very interesting to watch. So again, I wanna see more control, actually, in her case, and more dynamics. Again, lack of attack and also she's initiating this movement with her shoulders, which makes it look really amateurish. There's not enough softness through her knees and so that's partly why her movement looks very stiff. Adding a little softness, a little bit of spring can make the movement look a little bit smoother, a little bit more bouncy. This is an example of a poor transition moment. She just finished a turn and just freezes here. And sometimes it is appropriate to find a stillness, but this is not an interesting stillness to look at. There's really not much energy, again, not much energy coming out of her limbs. There's really nothing with the face or head position. The arms are in this really tense position and are still sort of moving even though she's still. And the legs are in this really weak, very close position. So from a viewer perspective, as an audience member who would be downstage, there's really nothing to see here. It's too collapsed and we're too small, too nonspecific and too tense. So here she's coming around into this twist again, lack of attack, lack of energy. So she really understands the basics of the choreography really well, understands the steps. It's that she's not adding this layer of texture, dynamic personality to it, and so it's a little bit lackluster. One reason that this movement is lackluster is because she's leading from her wrists here, so she's breaking at the wrists and leading the movement from the wrist, and that looks really weak. It's just not a weak place to start from. You can also see that she's got this really tight position here and this turned-in sort of hips, which is also making her dancing look very weak in this moment. So she did a good job arching and articulating through the lumbar spine, but did not really repeat that with the thoracic spine and has just moved basically the whole thoracic and cervical spine as one unit. And so she lost the nice spinal articulation that she set up at the beginning. So she needs to work on loosening up and articulating through her spine. This is very very weak. I don't understand why she chose to do it this way She's standing in this very non-specific shape with the feet They're just not far enough apart to be exaggerated or interesting or close enough together to be exaggerated or interesting one They're kind of slightly turned out from each other But the worst thing about this movement is that she's bringing these arms up and over in a fist and kind of making This X shape in front of her body, but she's doing it really really slowly But not in a controlled way it looks and I can tell it's not in a controlled way because She's really bending at the wrist elbow And so if it were more controlled it would just it would be even slower and a little bit more precise of a shape But the way she's doing it. It just looks super super weak So I would say either go way slower and add a lot of control or go very fast and hold each shape Because she would have extra music in that case so again she really lacks attack she lacks dynamics She lacks texture in her dancing which makes it uninteresting to watch So for some reason she brings this this leg was up in the layout and she brings it back toward her. That's really not where we how we typically end layouts because it doesn't look strong. The best way to end the layout is to step forward from where the foot just was and that just makes it look dynamic, interesting, and exaggerated. She wasn't able to do that because this knee, this the knee of the standing leg was so straight. There was no way that she was going to be able to step out further because she had such a straight knee. Her only choice was to bring it back and so that's why this is not successful in this moment. Good footwork here, nice job staying on the balls of the feet, good job balancing and counterbalancing with the arms. This looks really really strong. She's moving quickly because she's on the balls of her feet. Really nice little section here for her. The arms are really nice here because she's bringing them down and up and around in a really nice arc with straight elbows. The wrist here actually looks nice because it's kind of a graceful angle and there's energy out the fingers. Again though I would have loved to see a bit more attack as she comes down and then slowly bring it up. It's just a little bit too legato to really be strong and interesting to watch. So she did a good job with the arm, one arm behind her head, other arm behind her head very quickly in the timing here. But my issue is that she just kept looking straight forward and nothing really happened down here. It would have been much nicer if she looked one side or the, like maybe as this arm came up, looked in the opposite direction. And or as this arm came up, maybe pushing through the opposite hip, something like that to add some interest because the way that she did it, even though she was in the timing and had good attack there with those shapes, she looked very stiff because she just kept her gaze forward and her hips forward as well. Again, not enough attack. This looks really, really, really weak. I will say though that she did a good job standing up to, coming up to a standing position pretty quickly. Great attack as she brought her arms up and around. This is one of the best attacks that she's had the whole time and she's pretty much kept a nice straight elbow and nice fist here and that the fist looks intentional it looks strong and it looks symmetrical. So here she's coming down to the floor, but she hasn't even made contact fully with her hand, and that's not the correct way to do a fall. Best way is to bring the hand down first as your point of contact, and then swing the leg around through. And you want to swing the side of your leg around through so you don't smack your knee, and also it makes the fall smoother. And she's come down on the top of her knee, worried about injury over time, but also it looks quite clunky and heavy and awkward because of that. A little bit off the timing of the music here, she's actually too early for the beat, so she needed to take a little bit more time with her previous movement, slow it down a little bit. This is what I'm talking about with dynamics, finding these places of tension where a legato movement would actually be really helpful, and then finding these moments of release where a sharpness would be really helpful. So she could have added a little bit more legato to her previous movement so that she could attack this last moment right on the beat. Because she's a little bit early and it's the last movement, it really kind of detracts from her whole choreography. The ending and the beginning are like the most important parts of a choreography, and so when the ending is not strong, the piece is not strong. The shape itself is really nice, really nice angle here with the shoulders, elbows, energy out the fingertips. She's a little bit hyper flexible, so her shoulders are a bit far back and her elbows a bit hyper extended, but I'm okay with that in this moment. The shape is fine as is. I like this nice straight knee with the toes here. It looks strong. And then she just drops the shape and sort of just stands here very casually. Her arms are just at her sides as if she was just waiting for a bus or something. So, and she holds it for like an entire bar of music. So, she really just has lost the viewer's attention. It looks super unintentional and unclear. I would rather her hold the previous shape or make a new shape that looks intentional, that has some strength behind it, that has some energy behind it. This is just very weak and low energy. She came up really quickly here and in really good timing, great sharp attack. My issue is that she dropped the arms as she came up. And so again, there are moments like this where she's done something really nice, but she's detracting from the nice thing, beautiful thing that she did in some way. And in this case, it's because she dropped the arms before she was fully up. If she'd kept the arms up, it would have looked so much more impressive, but she's sort of like already moved on to the next thing. So this is an example where she didn't fully follow through with her movement. So again, that detracts from the movement because we don't get to see the whole movement before she moves on to the next thing. So this is a pretty good layout moment here for her. This would be even better though, if she, well, let me tell you why it's good. It's good because her elbows are really straight. She's in a 45 degree angle here, which is really nice because that's a very specific angle. Graceful bend through the wrist here and looking up at the ceiling, keeping the spine straight. This leg is nice and high, also very kind of specific angle, kind of pretty much 90 degrees. There's energy out her toes. So that's really, really nice. What I would say is that a layout really ideally would be a straight line from the toes to the head. She's not doing that. It's kind of broken here. And so it makes it look a tiny bit stiff. One way that she could get there better is if she had more of a plie, lower of a softer knee here so that she has a little bit more flexibility in terms of freedom of choice to move this upper part of her body more. Also probably a little bit of core strength would be helpful and really thinking of it as being flat and just make it that much more effective. This is such a great shape here and she does a really good job achieving it because as her arms are coming up she does a sort of a roll with her wrists to get them into this shape and it looks really strong especially because she keeps her feet close together here with a straight knee it kind of looks almost like an Egyptian sculpture or something. It's such a nice straight beautiful moment. Unfortunately again she does not hold it long enough for it to read very well. This would be so, I mean she really loses all the beauty of these shapes that she's making occasionally because she doesn't hold them for long enough so a little bit more attack so that she has time musically to hold it for just a millisecond so we can really see this beautiful shape she made. Again, lack of clarity here with the arms. She punched them downwards, but then immediately pulled the elbows up. So, we don't get to see any shape. So, it looks really awkward. Again, lack of attack bringing these arms forward. She doesn't straighten them for long enough for it to read as a shape. The fist looks good. Both fists are very strong and the position of the arms is great. It's just again, she lacks attack. I think she just needs to work generally on her muscle strength so that she can get good attack with things. I do like that she's moving into the hip here. It really adds a lot of interest to the shapes that she's making with her body in this movement. She does achieve a great tabletop position here, pretty great, because there's a 90 degree angle of the knee and of the ankle and so that helps this to look flat. Unfortunately she's still at too wide of an angle with the arm here, but pretty, pretty good job there. Also this arm looks pretty strong coming up which helps to further accentuate the tabletop position. So here she started the choreography. Great job getting onto the balls of her feet here. That will help to keep her movement nice and light. Pretty good shape here with a straight elbow, energy out the fingertips, and sort of 90 degree angle with the shoulder. Unfortunately she lacks the attitude and dynamics and personality that this movement could really have. So she's got the shape but how she got into it a little bit too slow, a little bit too smooth, kind of gazing in this non-specific angle here. Just yeah it just lacks interest. It just really doesn't grab the viewer's interest. So I'd love to see a little bit more of her personality coming through and a little bit more sharpness and getting to this shape. She's doing a pretty good job here of using the balls of her feet as her pivot point rather than her hips and I can tell because she's pretty much keeping her feet parallel and she's just transferring her weight from the ball of one ball of one foot to the ball of the other foot, which is nice. And her arm shape looks really strong. This is a great shape with the arm but again she lacks sharpness in her initiation of the movement and so she loses, we can't really see this shape for long enough, so she loses the nice shape. She's got such beautiful long limbs and sometimes really good extension like in this case but because she doesn't attack it, it gets lost. This is a really weak moment for her again I think she just needs to like go to the gym and do some other things to work on her arm strength and thinking about Really the initiation. Where is the initiation of this movement coming from? She's initiating it by bending and straightening her elbows slightly And so she gets this like really weak looking little bounce to the arms I think that it would be better if she was initiating it more from her center from her core or even from the shoulders Rather than the elbows because it just looks yeah, it just looks weak It looks like she doesn't have a lot of experience with this particular movement Great start to this movement. She's got a great plie. Her weight is a bit forward. I'd love to see just a little bit more weight back here, but regardless, the initiation of the movement of the spine here is really nice because she's creating this sort of backward C shape. And then the idea with this type, with this particular movement, is to then articulate the spine downward, kind of vertebrae by vertebra, and end up in the opposite C position down. So we'll see if she continues that trajectory. The arms look really strong. The elbows nice and, not straight, the elbows nice and bent and at a great angle away from her body so they're not collapsed inward. So it's a really strong shape here with the arms as well. So now she's running backwards here again. There's not enough energy There's just not enough energy the run the steps are way too small to be of any interest The arms are just again non-specific. They're just a little bit reacting to the step rather than being Helping her or making an image and so it just looks like a transition moment and it just looks like somebody walking backwards rather than someone doing a dance performance and also Whatever she's about to do next will not be as successful because she didn't really go for it I would actually recommend instead of thinking about running backwards Most people have a are nervous like they're your our brains don't want us to go backwards because we can't see backwards And so we have to fight that when we're going backwards in order to make it look very dancey and exaggerated So what I would say is instead of telling her, okay, I want you to run backwards here I would tell her I want you to do a few leaps backwards because if she thinks about it more like leaping she's not It will just make the movement bigger and more exaggerated and also prepare her better for whatever she's going to do next Here she's just frankly behind the music because she's not attacking this movement enough. She came up here way too slowly and so she's actually late. And also the lack of dynamics further makes this an ineffective moment. And again, it's unfortunate because look, she's way up high on the balls of her feet. That takes a lot of strength. That takes a lot of power. The arms look really strong. Her chin is jutted a bit forward. I'd love to see it just a little bit further in. But regardless, the arms are strong. Great angle with the shoulder. Nice straight elbow. Great energy out the fingertips. And again, being way high up on her toes, it's very impressive. But she gets there so slowly that number one, the lack of dynamic makes it less interesting. But also the fact that it makes her late for the music is not okay. Great attack here. She brought this arm, this right arm in front of her body and around and is leading with her elbow here. It looks really, really strong. Nice sharpness. This is something I want her to recreate throughout her dancing. Great attack and great arm movements here. So finally I'm seeing more attack with her movement. This arm looks really strong, straight elbow, nice fists here. This is the second repetition of this and both times she did a great attack. The leg looks really nice because she's brought this knee nice and high but without tilting her pelvis and while keeping a great posture. So really great little moments for her here. Here she's doing this crossover turn. She didn't quite cross over far enough with her legs in order to make this turn effective. And also she's trying to do the turn on the balls of her feet. This crossover turn is much better when the pivot point is with one heel and the other ball of the foot. So she's really not going to, she's just not executing this correctly. Her weight's also a little bit further back than it needs to be and her plie is a bit too deep and so it looks quite awkward, as well as her head looking, her gaze upward doesn't really help her and also again, makes it look quite stiff and awkward. Again, really nice footwork. Actually, in this moment, she's back onto a flat foot, but as she's moving through this basic step, she's pretty much staying on the ball of her foot, which is making the movement a little bit lighter. She just brought this toe out and back behind her very quickly. Great attack, great movement with the feet. Good musicality, she hit her arms up really quickly right on the music, but again, didn't hold it long. If you can see, she's already coming down at the end of that beat. And so, just really working on taking up all of the music, and if you're going to attack something, really give it a moment to sink in for your viewer. It just makes the dancing more impressive. Pretty good arc here with this arm. She brought it really, did a good job bringing it all the way to her front and now around to her back. Unfortunately, she kind of breaks it here. So I just want to see more strength in her arm shape here. More of a kind of a curve would be really, really nice as long as she could keep that curve. She's really got more of a bend here. This arm looks really good, nice and strong and clear. The gaze is not working for her. Again, there's like a lack of personality coming through and that's partly because she's just sort of still gazing off in this direction, even though the arm is doing something really interesting. So I would suggest just doing a little bit of something different with the gaze, a little something different with the facial expression. There's just not a lot of energy coming out of her, which is not grabbing the viewer's attention very well. Unfortunately, she lost that really nice shape. I would like to see if she brought, so she had both arms in the air with fists, really nice shape, and held it for long enough for it to read. But as she brought this one down, she allowed this one to bend. And so again, it compromises the nice shapes that she's making. Also here, she's quite straight through this knee, and she's really like pushing the pelvis forward and keeping it as one unit with the rest of her spine. So this also looks quite awkward and stiff.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Her feet are able to find more clarity again, and she uses her pelvis to sway side to side in a way that feels natural and connected to the music. However, now that her and her partner are disconnected, she starts to use her arms in this kind of floating manner above her head, which feels a little bit disconnected from what's happening in her lower body. Overall, she could just use some more clarity in the choreography of her arms in particular. As the dancer transitions, unfolding and turning out from her partner while staying connected with one singular hand, she struggles a little bit through this transition, which perhaps could be the fault of the leading partner that's guiding her. Nevertheless, she falls off the rhythm here quite significantly and appears a little bit confused in what movement she's expected to perform next. Overall, she's kind of got this very pedestrian stance. You can see her shoulders are a little bit more curved than they were before, indicating she might be less confident. And she's kind of lost that movement that she had in her pelvis prior, which showed that she was confident in embodying the rhythm. As the dancer performs what appears to be a take on the Charleston, she performs a series of kicks with her right leg while her left leg remains supporting. As she's performing this step, she would really benefit from making her movements a bit smaller here. Because she's kicking her leg so wide out from underneath her pelvis, she's disconnecting from the rhythm and not able to move as quickly and efficiently as she would want to in order to keep the embodiment of the rhythm here. As the dancer begins to freestyle a bit more, incorporating some jumps, some kicks, and some more non-traditional movement into her freestyle, she goes in and out of connecting with the rhythm, she would just really benefit from some additional rehearsal and added clarity here of the choreography. However, overall, she really has a nice energy about her, and she's able to move quickly and efficiently through the steps, not getting too caught up in the transitions, particularly now as she's dancing disconnected from her partner. Thank you. As the primary dancer begins this movement phrase by performing a series of step touches, moving side to side and swaying her hips side to side, she's able to effectively engage her pelvis, her torso, and down through her lower body, her legs, and her feet. However, she's got a lot of movement happening in her arms, and while it's great that she's utilizing her arms, it feels a bit distracting from the movement and tends to throw her off the rhythm a little bit. Her arms are just kind of floating above her head, moving in this very light and kind of indirect sustained pattern, which feels like there is a bit too much movement happening in the upper body that's really disconnected from the movement that's happening in the torso and below. As the dancer performs this one-legged turnaround herself, she's able to do so quickly and efficiently, particularly thanks to the use of her head as she's spotting her head through this movement, which keeps her stable and able to move quickly and with a lot of clarity here. She also has a nice shaping of her left arm, which is neatly connected to her hip with her elbow out, and she's lifting her right leg in a way that might be throwing her off balance slightly, but feels appropriate for the movement overall. In general, she executes the turn with a lot of fluency and understanding of the movement vocabulary. After performing a series of turns, the dancer again appears a little bit unconfident or unsure of what performance or what piece of the performance comes next. Again, I'm not sure if this is to her fault or the fault of her leading partner who is audibly saying that he's not very good at the performance or he doesn't quite know what he's doing or similar sentiments. So I can't fully blame her for falling off the rhythm here, but overall she really does disconnect from the rhythm and she demonstrates that she struggles to transition from one step to another. As the dancer is performing a series of rock steps and triple steps with her partner, she is not engaging her arms in a significant way, but that's very appropriate as she's using them to connect physically with her partner. She's also able to maintain her embodiment of the rhythm, particularly in the lower body in the feet. In this instance, she's able to stay on rhythm and perform the movement with clarity and efficiency.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Because I think the next hole is one of these guys. So he is actually set up really nicely to kind of go bigger. But instead he kind of tries to force the hand match and just is not able to do so. So starting, he looks really nice. His arms are nice and engaged. These holes do not look to be that amazing. He looks really confident. His arms are nice and tense, but not overly pulling in. He seems to have a nice foot spacing. He's got this higher right foot, and this left foot's a little bit lower. And so actually that final right foot would actually be really good before he just slipped off right there because then he'd be opposite posed. You could do a little back leg, right foot up, you know, and then he's got right foot on, left foot on, right foot on, left hand on. And you should be able to tension and kind of just push up and grab this big kind of side pull, pinchy, slopey, juggy thing.

As you can hear the sizzling sound, the pan for an omelette, depending on the style of your liking, it's a bit too hot so it creates that sound for a crispier bottom and not necessarily like a quicker cooking. If you want a smoother omelette, it would be a little bit less on the heat and not as hot when you add your egg mixture. So we're making an omelette. This gentleman is collecting all the tools and ingredients. We call it maize and plaz, which is a great effective way to have everything ready for prepping and when you start to cook. Nice that he's swirling the oil around the pan to make it coat the bottom of the pan evenly It is a great idea to create a little pile on the counter on the discard from the vegetables.

In either scenario, they need to shift their left hand to make space for the right for the move to work. So this is good even though the climber opts to come back to this position, they actually feel out the start a few different ways to see if there's a better way to begin the problem. So it's a really good technique from the ground because it's a few spots where you can actually feel body position without actually waiting the hold and using an attempt. So they were eventually able to switch hands and almost had the right hand in the hold, but rather than going forward, they tried to bring the left hand back to the starting position, which was just going to trap them, so they fall as a result. Climber pulls on but it looked a little bit desperate. Their body was falling away from the wall as they reached the hold.

She has one arm higher than the other and this is alternating with every step that she takes so that's really good that she's also using her arms in these basic salsa dance steps and it's not solely concentrated on her feet. The dancer should widen her stance. On these jumps, her feet are close together and should be further apart. The dancer's left arm that is extended could have more energy. She should straighten her arm at her elbow joint so that it's not bent and also lift it so that it's aligned with her shoulder. Here the dancer is high on her toes with her heels lifted off the ground when she's twisting which allows her more more space to twist. And this is good this foot, the way in which she's balancing her weight on her feet right now is what I was saying before what she should have done when she was doing the basic salsa step forward and backwards. Also, the dancer's arms are at the same angle. She's making a V here, but the angle of her arms are exactly the same. So that's really good. The dancer's arms are really good here. They're extended completely, both her right and her left arm, with energy radiating outwards. The dancer is taking very little steps on these basic salsa steps. She's taking up only a small space on the floor. She should instead be taking bigger steps, traveling further forwards and backwards. The dancer should also bend her knees more when she's landing so that the jump could have a greater range of motion. So it would look like she jumped higher if she bends her knees more when she lands so that the level changes easier to see. The dancer should shimmy her shoulders to a greater extent so that there's more movement. She just requires more energy overall. She is shimming her shoulders, but this could be much bigger. The dancer is also stepping on flat feet. She's dancing flat-footed. She should be instead putting her weight on her toes, stepping on her toes first with her heels lifted off the ground.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And in this movement we can see that the climber is doing a dynamic movement. But one thing I want to definitely point out is what we can see is with her left arm here, we can kind of see how much she's pulling in with her body right here, or with her upper body. So that kind of shows to me that the climber is really relying on her upper body to be the main force or the main power to get her up into this next position. But what I would actually encourage for the climber is if she kind of strained out her arms a little bit more. So then that way she can kind of focus on transitioning her body weight more over this left foot here. Just because it does seem like that left foot is a pretty big foot to utilize. So she should be able to use it in a better way. And trying to avoid how much her upper body is doing right now because it does take away from how much her lower body can work right now. And so here we can see that as the climber is getting closer to reaching that left hand that they're aiming for We can see that the left foot has now slipped off of the foothold here And one of the main reasons why I think that is is because the climber is focusing so much on Getting their upper body closer to the wall And by producing the power with their upper body it helps to take away some of their body weight from their feet And as a result, that's why their left foot is coming off this foothold right here But because that foothold is now off the wall and we can see the rest of the body Is starting to fall away from the wall as well So it does mean that the climber has a harder time of actually grabbing on to that left and hold that they're aiming for", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Instead of keeping the arms straight and swaying the hips back and forth, the climber tries to maybe get a little more punchy with it with their arms and lock them down. It's really important to tweak the beta. I do think that this is not going to allow the climber to get much higher on the wall and thus come even shorter up on the hold. And the climber comes up pretty short going for the target hold. Um, it's very common for climbers to think about what to do with their arms. Um, and it takes a little bit more experience to really understand that most moves, especially like jumps like this are actually about recruiting more from the legs and you can see that. This is the start foot, but here's the climbers foot. So their foot's actually lower than the foot that they're driving off of. If they were to maintain driving through that foot, their hips would be closer to where their head is. Um, and getting into this target hold would be much easier.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So they are hanging on with a right hand behind the arm here, and then they were able to bring their left foot back on the wall right here. So again we see opposite points of contact, and this does allow the climber to kind of rotate and pivot around that left foot. So in this case they are rotating the left side of their hip closer to the wall to kind of help reinforce the movement that they're going for. And then the trick here is to make sure that they try and keep their right arm in a straight position, and also keep a tight shoulder where they can kind of turn around on that right shoulder. And this gets the entire body kind of rotating all the way from the foot all the way up to the arm. However another thing that we can kind of see from the beginning of the boulder is that this climber's flagging foot continues to kind of hang out and away from the wall. So this pulls the climber further and further away from the wall every time, so it's forcing them to have to pull on their arms much more. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing the right hand over into the next handhold. So in that position they are again in opposite points, so that's gonna be a left hand with a right foot. So this does encourage the climber to kind of rotate their body so the right side of the body is getting closer to the wall and this encourages the movement that they're trying to go for. So again, this is kind of a similar position where they're sitting down on their right leg, left arm is in a straight position. And this is a good thing to kind of conserve the energy in the upper body and utilize the strength that they have in their lower body. So here we can see the clown was able to make the next move of bringing their right hand over into the next handhold here. So in this position we can see that they are hanging on with a left hand here. And they did place a right foot down in this position right here. So this position is a much more controlled position and this is actually what we call a backstep move. In where they're using opposite points of contact from each other. And the main point is to encourage the use of their legs in order to push them up into the next move. So here we see exactly that. That the clamber is kind of sitting on their right leg because it's in a bent position here. And when they're ready they're going to be pushing off of that right leg with the help of this left flagging foot. And that would encourage them to kind of use their legs to push them up into the next movement here. And then here we can see in this left arm it's a straight position and this encourages them to kind of conserve the energy on that arm. So this is a much better position that I wish the clamber did in their first opening move. Because this would have been a nice way of conserving their energy and relying on their legs to move them up into their next hold. Without relying so much on their arms to pull them up. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the final move I'll bring in the right hand over to the final hold here. I mean in this position We can see that they are in opposite points of contact So it's going to be a left hand as well as a right foot in this position here and then in this case the climbers focusing on rotating the right side of Their hip closer to the wall and this helps to guide them in the direction that they want to go to This is a better position because we can kind of see how much the leg is in the bent position here While their left arm is in a straight position So this again shows that they're reinforcing how much they're using their lower body, which is always a good thing I'm in the conserving the energy on the upper body Especially because they're getting tired from being at the top of the boulder And so here we can see an example of by allowing themselves to be in an extended position because they were originally hanging on or putting that foot on the yellow hold right there and now in this position we do see that they had to kind of release that foot from that position in order to kind of reset themselves where they needed to be. So I would never really encourage climbers to do this because it does force 100% of their body weight on their upper body and then here in particular we can see that the arms are in a very bent position here so this does use up a lot of energy very quickly on their upper body as well as their core tension just because they have to engage their cores to swing their feet back into the wall and get into a position that they need. So I'd always encourage climbers to make sure they have at least one foot on the wall at all times to prevent this from happening. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring their right hand up and so they're now in a match position on this yellow hold here. So in this position the climber quickly did this move by hanging on with their left hand and then placing a right foot on this yellow holder here. So again this does kind of allow the climber to kind of transfer the body weight over to the right so they're going to be underneath their right arm. And then by doing that this helps them to bring up their other arm into that position. One thing I'm noticing though again in this position the climber is allowing their flagging foot to kind of hang out and away from the wall. So this kind of pulls away from the fact that they're trying to keep their body close to the wall and with this constant flagging foot kind of swinging out and away from the wall. It's kind of pulling the climber away from the wall forcing them to have to squeeze harder on their hands. So here we can see the climber was able to make the first move of bringing the right hand over to the next handhold. So in the starting position the climber is hanging on with the left hand here, as well as the left foot in this position here. And so because the climber is using two points of contact that are on the same side of their body, which is their left hand and left foot, what this does is it doesn't actually force the body to go down to the left side of those two points. And so what's ending up to happen is the climber has to compensate for that balance in a certain way as they move over for that right hand. So one thing that we can see happening is that right leg kicking down and away from the wall. And that's just a result of this rotation that's taking place around those two points. So normally I would not encourage climbers to be in a position like this, because on top of that, the climber is also forced to have to pull and hang with their left arm here to kind of fight off that rotation as well. So this is forcing the climber to use a lot of upper body strength straight off the bat, which doesn't do a good thing about conserving their energy. So I would always kind of encourage climbers to make sure in a balanced position where they're not having to rely on pulling strength in order to complete a move. So what I would have encouraged for this climber is instead of putting a left foot on the starting foot hold, I would encourage them to place a right foot on the starting foot hold. And this would allow them to kind of hang straight down with their left arm and push off that right foot in the direction that they need to over with this right hand. And so here we can see the Clamor was able to make the next move of bringing that left hand over into the next handhold here. So in this position they are hanging on with a right hand here and they did decide to keep a low left foot here. So one thing that's good about this position is they are utilizing points of contact with each other again and then what we can see happening here is they are rotating the left side of their body closer to the wall here to kind of encourage the move that they're doing with the left hand here. However with their right flagging foot we can kind of see that it's just hanging out into space and actually pulling away from the wall. So this actually helps to pull the rest of the Clamor's body away from the wall making it harder for them to kind of really place a lot of body weight on that left leg. And then on top of that we can see the distance that the Clamor is putting themselves in from their left foot all the way to the left hand and this is kind of what I would call an extended position and where their leg is basically fully straight and the arm is completely straight over the body and what this does is it does force a lot of extra tension on their core in order to stay on the wall because what's most likely to happen at this point is that left foot will slide off that foothold because it's hard to maintain that tension which causes them to swing out and away from the wall and then forcing them to hang harder on their hands which uses up a lot of energy. So I would always encourage Clamor's to make sure they avoid getting themselves into an extended position if they can and this would mean placing a higher foot before committing to this hand sequence because right now this just makes it a little bit harder for the Clamor to continue climbing throughout the boulder. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring in their left hand over into the next handhold here So both hands are really close to each other now in this position But before bringing in that left hand the climber was hanging on with the right hand And then did also use a left foot out here So again, these are opposite points of contact and they are separated from each other So this does place the climbers body in between the two points. So this does naturally place them in a very controlled position The trick here is to make sure that they transfer the body weight over to the right side So then that way they can hang straight down directly underneath Their right arm, which is exactly what we see happening here So as a result both arms go in a very straight position Directly underneath the handhold as opposed to away from the handhold So this is a much more controlled position because we can see that with this leg It's still in a bent position. So that means that there's a lot of body weight being placed on it And because her arms are directly underneath her This does encourage her to kind of conserve the energy in her arms And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing the left hand up into the next handhold So in this position they are hanging on with the right hand here and they did utilize a left foot down low over here So because you're using opposite points of contact and these points of contact are kind of separated from each other This does allow the climber to kind of get in a coordinated position in between those two points, which is a good thing to see So this is a much more balanced position However, one thing that I noticed is that as the climber moves up with that left hand Instantly the climbers bodyweight kind of falls back and away from the wall One of the main reasons why I think this is the case is the use of their flagging foot a lot of the time So far I've seen that their flagging foot is kind of hanging out and away from the wall And with this flagging foot hanging away from the wall and actually pulls the rest of the body from the wall So this could be one of the main reasons why the climbers kind of extending out after grabbing onto that left hand So I would always encourage climbers to really make sure they are aware of the body tension that they need To maximize the amount of use in their lower body Because right now being forced that they're hanging out away from the wall This is forcing the climber to have to pull and pinch harder on their hands more than they probably need to And especially for the second move of the climb. I would encourage the climber to kind of conserve the energy a little bit better", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He keeps the pull-up position but what's important here is that in order for the climber to make the reach he needed to propel himself with much force. The reason why the left leg is extended and the climber has made a kick for this to come off a strong squat but since there is no foot placement for that extended leg the climber just had crunched up the leg and has done a quick kick to help with the motion when going up for the move. Here we can see the climber performing a foot hop, foot swap. So the climber relies on the grips of both, both being pinches. Then the climber is able to create pressure to pull himself in and hold on to that weight while he does that foot switch, releasing the left foot to take the right foot in place. He places the right foot with the sole of the toe box area to be pressed. This is a big enough hole where the climber was able to do a quick jump to make that swap. Here we can see the climber moving the left hand prematurely out of the start hold. The climber first must lift up the right foot to be potentially on a flag, meaning extended out and off the mat. But this would need to be first stable and controlled by keeping the arms extended and fully having the grips and the foot that's in place hanging on to the climber's stability before starting the climb. Here we can see the climber has completely swung out and has dropped the feet down below. This means that the climb is over for him as he already touched the ground. Due to the motion of the swing being so powerful and out, the climber no longer was able to pinch onto the hold and potentially he has stepped off from the climb due to losing pressure on the grips. Here we can see the climber starting at a one-hold start. Both hands are going to be placed in the same hold. As we can see, the climber has made the placement with the thumbs underneath and the fingers above. This is called a pinch. The climber looks and secures it just as a clamp, where the pressure is a lot generated by placing the thumbs underneath. It helps the pinch also if the climber can apply pressure from above. This being the fingers. To do the pressure on the fingers, the climber must lean back in order to apply pressure onto the grip. The climber is also bringing the left toe into placement. This one is a big hold. The climber is on, so it's able to apply a lot of the surface from the toe box. Once the climber gets to bring the left foot onto the wall, then the climb will start. because the reach was dynamic, the climber then has placed all of the force onto that hold above, keeping that palm open and creating friction by leaning on that hold is important. So the climber, while committing into that grip, has let the feet automatically have come off due to losing pressure down below at the feet when making the move. To keep himself closed, the climber is still engaging on the pinch while the feet are off the wall. This is called feet just cut off. So in order for the climber to get back into the wall, he will have to hold on to those grips tight and engage the core to bring the feet at a higher stance onto the next placement. Here we can see the climber be ready for getting into an explosive position aiming for the hold up above. Now in order to do this, body position is important. So the climber had swapped his feet and had left the leg, the left leg to be hanging. This to help the climber with balancing when going up for the throw. So the body positioning in this one, he's keeping his right side fleshed with the wall and this is important because the climber will need to have the reach going out with the right hand. Now as we can see to help with the climber keeping that side close to the wall, he has bended his right leg to have the knee pointing out to the left and he brings himself with chest forward first, this being helped by the pull that he's holding on to that pinch in this moment and dropping the left leg helps the climber to keep the hips to be pointed to the right side towards the wall. And as we can see his leg is bended creating an imaginary squat even though he is doing most of the precision for from the right toe. Now the climber will be using the leg bended so that he can propel himself for the next move. Here, the climber is quickly making the move to the next hold. In order to do that, the climber needed to leave the right foot off the mat, which is the one sustaining all of the climber's weight. And has done this quickly by stepping up on the highest foot to transfer the weight over. As soon as the climber made the pressure of the highest foot, the climber is just leaving the mat and quickly has moved the left hand to go out left.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The dancer is leading with his left foot forward, using his heel first. He should never be stepping with his heel first. He should always be stepping, leading with his toes. The dancer is not standing completely tall in his verticality. We see his spine is a bit condensed in total His entire body is a bit condensed especially since he is a tall man. He can't stand up tall just needs to extend through his head that happens as a Consequence of the bottom of his spine or his coccyx bone straight up. He should be extending So he's standing tall right now. He's a bit hunched over The dancer isn't dancing in tandem with the music. He is dancing pretty independent of the music. He's not on rhythm most of the time. His pacing doesn't match the tempo of the music. The dancer is moving flat-footed with his standing foot to foot on the ground, flat on the ground. Instead, he should have his weight anchored towards his toes with his heels slightly off the ground so that he can maneuver around the space with much more ease and be lighter on his feet. The dancer's leg movement isn't exactly clear here. His right leg should be straight behind him right now. It's a bit on a diagonal instead of straight behind him, and his knee isn't fully stretched and straightened. So the movement is a bit unclear here. When the dancer does these triple steps, these steps of three, one, two, three steps, on the second step his feet should meet together. He doesn't really emphasize the step, doesn't make it apparent, his footwork's not articulate here. It should be three distinct steps and on the second step his feet should be meeting together. Again, the dancer is hunching over and not extending completely tall in his verticality here. Even if he was to bend a knee, which is fine, his upper body shouldn't be curved the way it is here. It should be in a straight line. The dancer is using his arm as if he is dancing with a partner, which is common in this swing dance style. However, there's no partner there, so his movements with his arms are a bit awkward. Especially it's kind of adding to him condensing his spine because he's bending as if he's dancing with a partner that's shorter than him. But even if the partner was shorter than him, he should be extending his arm further, not bending at his spine. So for him, practicing his arm movements aren't necessarily helping his full body here. He'd be better off dancing as if he is dancing as a solo, which he is dancing as a solo. So his arm movements should reflect that instead of an invisible partner. The dancer is looking downward at times. He sees a lot of the floor in the frame. Instead, he should be looking straight out so that his spine is in a straight line. Right now, his neck is tilted a bit forward, so it's not in line with his spine. His spine should actually be one vertical line.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So just being careful about where the weight should be on the foot is important for safety. I would encourage the dancer to lift their gaze. Right now it looks like they're looking at the floor, but if they lift their gaze, it would open up their chest and torso and create more presence throughout the movement. I would encourage the dancer to incorporate their shoulders and their torso into this arm movement so it doesn't look like the arm is just kind of flapping. It creates fluidity of the movement. The dancer has really great energy. I think they should think about the details and their shoulder placement in this movement. So the flexion of their hands, what part of the feet are they tapping on, where should their abs, abdominals be engaged. Those details take it to the next level of this basic choreography. I would encourage a dancer to think about their foot placement. It kind of seems like their feet are kind of rotated in a bit. So really think about where they should place their foot and making sure when they step side to side they're equal distance apart to create symmetry within the movement.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I think it could be a positioning thing.

So when we're placing the ball here we need a slight or no side spin at all. He does an excellent job of making sure that he puts a slight amount of side spin on the ball so once it hit this portion of the top right corner of the square it went into the basket. When we place it in the top right corner of the square we have to be careful not to put too much side spin on the ball because if we put too much side spin on the ball it will come off too quickly and too hard off of the backboard and now that's where we hit the left side of the rim and that's when we have the opportunity for it to bounce off of the rim and we miss the layup. On this attempt he did an excellent job of putting just a slight amount of side spin so it bounced off the backboard and went into the basket relatively easily. Here the player does an excellent job of keeping two hands on the ball as he's taking his steps and taking the strides to jump off the ground. He makes sure he keeps two hands on the ball and then once the ball passes his shoulder level that's when he begins to extend the ball out and transfers the ball from two hands to his right hand and extend the ball out in his right hand and finish the layup at the apex of his jump. Here the player shows the correct footwork and jumping technique and jumping mechanics for doing a right hand reverse layup when we're jumping off of one foot. As you see he jumps off of his left foot and he does a good job of lifting his knee up to his waist level as he's exploding off of the ground and going up into the air. By lifting this knee up as he jumps that assists, that helps him to explode off of the ground and up into the air and reach the highest capabilities of his one legged jump. On this last layup attempt, he showed off his jumping ability and he made sure that he jumped as high as he can and he was so high above the rim that he didn't need to use the backboard. He just dropped the ball in over the front of the rim. Throughout all of his layup attempts, they all looked the exact same except for this last attempt where he showed off a bit and really demonstrated how high he can get. And when we're able to reach this level of our jump, we can just easily drop the ball over the front of the rim and into the basket. taking a look at the placement of the ball on the backboard you see it slightly hits outside this portion of the square so due to the placement on the backboard a good amount of sidespin is needed for the spin off of the backboard and into the basket and he did an excellent job of putting the correct amount of sidespin on the ball so it would spin off of the backboard and go into the basket Here you see the ball is extended out in his right hand and he's releasing the ball from his right hand off of his fingertips at the apex of his jump. This is really good technique as far as him extending the ball out in his right hand by him extending the ball out that high and away from his body with his right hand that makes it harder for the defense to contest his shot. You take a look at his left hand you see how it's down low. Ideally we would like the hand to be up a little bit higher to protect the shot so if the defense tries to contest the shot from his left side that arm, they would have to come across his arm which would be a foul or they will by them making contact with his arm and the referee doesn't call the foul. His arm will slow the defender down long enough for him to release this ball off his fingertips before the defense has an opportunity to block or", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Right here as you can see outside of the box is slightly outside of the box but only a little bit so we only don't really need that much side spin in order for us to make the ball go into the basket and the player used just a little bit of side spin due to the placement of the ball off of the backboard and was able to spin right into the basket. On this shot you can see the placement of the ball here is on that top line which is good. It has good height but as you can see here here's the line right here so it's on the inside of the outside of that box. As the ball hits there, if we place the ball there we can't have any side spin. Otherwise the ball is going to spin off the backboard and we're going to miss it off the left side of the rim. On this particular attempt he put a little bit too much side spin and it spinned off the backboard and we missed the shot. Now if you would put that same amount of side spin but hit slightly outside of the box or even a little bit on the line of the box it would have been okay and he would have made the shot but since it was inside of that line and he put that side spin on the ball we end up missing the layup. On this reverse layup attempt, he put side spin on the ball when he released it and had good placement as far as height because the ball hit the top of the white box on the backboard. But as you can see, the ball hit the backboard inside the outside of the white line on the white box on the backboard. So because of the placement of where the ball hit the backboard and the side spin that it created, it forced the ball to miss long on the left side of the basket. on this reverse layup attempt you see that he once again had a good height and placement of the ball at the top of the line on the top of the white box on the backboard. However on this one you see that the ball is placed inside of the outside of the white box on the backboard. So when it's inside of the backboard inside this line right here on this box we don't want any side spin. As you can see with this example he had too much side spin on the ball so the ball was spinning too much this way for the placement of the ball on this spot on the backboard so it ended up coming off and we miss it to the left side of the basket. The player shows really good footwork here for the reverse lip. As he takes the dribble, he makes sure that he steps with that left foot as he takes that dribble. Because he takes the dribble and steps with that left foot, when he picks up the ball, that left foot, even though it's still on the ground, he picks up the ball with two hands, it does not count as a step. This is what's known as a gather step. So when he picks up the ball, that first step will be with his right foot, when he puts the right foot down here in this area for step one. And then he'll take his left foot for step two, put it down in here for the layup. So right here is a good example of when you want to take your final dribble. You take your dribble with your right hand, step with that left foot, and you'll pick it up. So you take those steps, one, two, and you end up jumping off of that left foot. On this layup attempt, you can see that on the side of the box, he was able to place the ball slightly inside the line of the box there. But however, it's below this top line of the box. But it's still a good shot because it's above the bottom line of this box. So as long as we place the ball above the bottom line of the top of the box, we have a really good chance of making the shot. Now when we're playing against less athletic players, it's okay for us just to raise the ball, hit the ball, place the ball off the backboard. Just slightly above the bottom of the box, as shown as an example with this layup. But when we're playing against higher level, more athletic players who can jump really high and block a lot of shots, it's important for us to place the ball at the top of the box or above. So that we're not worried about our shot being blocked or disrupted by athletic defender. On this attempt right here you can see on the plane of the top of the box it has really good height. So the height that we placed the ball off of the backboard was really good. But as you can see it's on the outside of the box. So since it's here on the outside of the box and it's that far outside of the box we need to put a lot of side spin on this ball to make the ball spin a lot in this direction so it can go right into the basket. Unfortunately on this attempt he didn't have enough side spin and so it spent a little bit but it ended up coming up short and hitting the front of the rim and we missed the shot. The player here shows really good ball placement off the backboard by hitting the top corner of this box here. We hit the top of that box right there and also the side of the box here so right there at that intersection of the top of the box and the side of that box perfectly places the ball off that spot and it goes right into the basket.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He needs to place this ball, stop, dead still, stationary, and then kick it or initiate a kicking action. That would actually be a true penalty kick. So that would be the recommendation that he do in this sequence. So one thing that he's also doing in this picture specifically is that he's not going into a place where he's having a back lift in this direction here, slight back lift and then a forward motion with his foot. And that's because he's not taking a run up into the ball, right? So he's eliminating that and that helps create some of that power as it goes, as he like he transfers force through the ball. Here what he's doing is he's planted one foot here and he plants one foot here and he's simply lifting this foot now off the ground here and then initiating the swing as soon as he lifts his foot to here. So there's zero momentum being created here. There's no power, no force being created as he goes into this because there's no leg swing. There's zero leg swing. He's just lifting his foot and then bringing it through to this position. So this is incorrect. So my recommendation is that he start from further behind the ball, that he take two, three steps into the ball to get to this position. But as he arrives there, he can lift and then come back through and swing through the ball. That would help a lot with this because right now he's not generating any power and not giving good direction to the ball with his kick. So here, what you notice is that he placed the ball right here as opposed to the beginning of the exercise where he placed the ball right here. Again, if it's a penalty kick, this should be taken from the exact same spot every single time in order to create repetition of a technique that will transfer to an actual gameplay. Right now, this is just him placing the ball wherever he wants to and it's not a, not, it's not nothing that he would actually use or repeat into a game. So that's number one. Number two is the passing technique. You can see with that plant foot, it's consistently going this way. He's overcompensating with this by hitting the ball more towards the inside of his foot. And so it's coming off here towards this direction, his intended target. I mean, it shouldn't be that hard to miss because he's shooting only from, you know, a few, a few meters or a few yards away. So it's all about just giving the ball direction. He's a bit more bent over with his upper body here, which is better than what we've seen before, where he was leaning more backwards. So I like that. I like that his support leg is bent here. So you can tell he's got some balance with his arms out to the side. That's better there. And he's following through towards his intended target. That kicking foot is following through towards that action, but he's not generating any power. It's because he's not taking a run up into the ball. He's taking one step into the ball and then kind of lightly passing the ball on purpose without any speed. This is another illegal one that I want to point out where the ball is bouncing actually up and down in this current position and the ball is not stationary and on the ground and he's actively looking to strike this ball. You can tell by the movement with his back foot. Again, not a legal kick. Recommendation here that he gets the ball and he places it down stationary and then initiates the kicking sequence. This is probably the best that I've seen so far with that support foot in terms of the like the how where it's placed in Relation to the ball, so it's next to the ball and in this sense That's not in front of the ball. So the toes just like even with the front side of it. That's great. I like that a lot His knee is soft and bed With from the support side of things his arms are slightly out to the side. I think that's good What I don't like about this picture is that he's leaning backwards again If he was just leaning forward head over the ball More torso over the ball and brought a little speed a little power into the ball and then went through and followed through landed on That kicking foot. I think he would do a lot better at giving the ball direction creating power Etc. Right now. This is just he's it's not there's not a lot being brought through into the ball It's the same repeated mistakes that he's making over and over again But at least what I like in this clip is just the Like a good picture of where that foot should be planted where that toe should be pointed Because it naturally helps align his hips to his target So as you can see just on the follow through portion of this, this is a very minimal follow through as he kicked it with his left foot. He's doing the same thing again where he's putting one foot staggered in front of the other and then just lifting that back foot and swinging it in a forward direction. So no power, no momentum being brought through into the ball to create power and direction for the ball. So here this is just showing the follow through. It's a very soft, not quick or not fast follow through where he's just kind of landing now on this kicking foot and sort of transferring weight from this foot to this foot here. Again, he's really not trying to shoot the ball hard. It looks like he's actively trying to just pass the ball and hit the ball soft without power. The subject here is taking a penalty kick where he's placed the ball stationary down on the ground. That's correct, the ball is not moving. It's towards the center of the goal, so it should be at a fixed position. Typically there would be a dot here and the ball would have to be placed somewhere inside that dot. That dot essentially. So this is where he needs to place it, needs to be touching that. And then he can initiate or go back as far as he wants away from the ball and move into the ball and create a shooting action to then strike it at the goal. There is no direct opponent here, so no goalkeeper in the goal. This is also not 12 yards away from the goal, so that's another thing that we just got to consider as you think about what actually is a penalty kick versus what is not. But he's initiating an actual penalty kick sequence. What I think he could improve on immediately from what I'm seeing in this picture is just the distance of how far he's running up into the ball. He's taking one step back and then he's going one step into the ball. So there's no forward momentum, no power going into his strike. He's going to be hitting basically a one step inside the foot pass more than likely into the goal. So really just a passing technique into the goal at that point and versus a real opponent, that wouldn't be enough to get past an opponent. So my recommendation is that he puts his ball down, he steps back two to three, maybe even four steps back and get into a consistent rhythm each repetition. That's what we would want to see. On this kick, this is just again with the support foot constant mistake. This guy's making is Support foot here is way too close to the ball It's pointing in this direction here directly there He's over compensating here with over rotating his hips to try to get this one This leg to then strike the ball towards this direction as his planter foot points to the other direction here So his balance is not really is all really messed up here and the balls kind of underneath them a little bit I think again just get this plant foot a little bit to a better space over here, but take a run-up from here Move into the ball plant that foot then strike that's gonna be just like just get that routine down I think if he did that at the bare minimum This would help a lot with the actual shot that he's taking from close range The other thing with that kicking foot is that heel again is higher than the toe and his toes pointed down So what he's not doing is creating a flat hard surface if he locks his ankle toe up heel down That's gonna help and get these arms out a little bit more to the side to help for balance He's gonna have a lot better a lot better of a chance of hitting the ball with power Here, he's moved the ball again to a totally new position. Again, incorrect. We want this ball to go be placed back where it was originally started from the first repetition. Second thing is that he's changed his kicking foot in this picture, so he's now kicking with the left foot. You can see the first error that he's making completely is that that plant foot is well behind the ball. I think in order to just fix this, I would just make a stop him and make a recommendation that that plant foot be here next to the ball and that that toe is pointed towards the direction that he wants to go to help align his hips. I think that as a starting point would help him be a lot more effective in striking the ball. So from that one step setup, here's his actual kicking technique and there's a there's a lot of errors that are occurring here Let's start with his plant foot so the one thing that you see right away is that the plant foot is facing in this direction and It's a full it's fully behind the ball. So there's two issues there Number one is that because it's facing this way his hips will also naturally face that direction So where he's making contact and kicking the ball is actually wide of the goal So to correct that he needs to get this foot to face the goal or his intended target Which will naturally align his hips better towards that direction as opposed to right now where they are currently Okay, so that's number one. Number two is that because this plant foot is behind the ball He's kicking the ball and leaning backwards. You can see that in his upper body completely He's leaning backwards as he's hitting the ball His heel is higher than his toe So his toes slightly pointed down and so all that means is as he kicks that ball that ball is more than likely gonna roll Off the toe of it the toe of his foot and go in this direction So we will we want to correct is be more over the ball with his upper body So he's leaning towards lean forward head over the ball toe would be pointed higher than the heel So it'd be a locked ankle essentially created an L shape as he contacts the ball and That he get that support foot next to the ball so that he can contact the ball more in the center", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He's alternating his arms when he does this, switching between one arm and the other. And while this is a greater incorporation of arm choreography, it still appears quite significantly disconnected from the rhythm. He doesn't seem to be making any sort of specific shape. You can see over here on the EcoCam that his hand is just kind of loosely above his head, not shaped in any sort of particular way. And his arm is quite crunched to his head where he would benefit from really extending the arm upwards more significantly, lengthening that line and connecting that movement more to the rhythm. It appears to happen quite sporadically and at times that are a bit awkward in contrast with what's happening with the music and the rest of his body. As the dancer performs a transitional step to change his facing from the back of the room now towards the front of the room, while he is still struggling with the movement, particularly in his upper body and even through his head, he shows he has a solid command or at least a solid understanding, perhaps he's not to the embodied stage yet, but he has a solid understanding over the rhythm, particularly through his footwork. He's able to keep this transition step on rhythm with the music, including a step touch of the other foot, that shows that he has a connection to the rhythm and an understanding of what he should be doing rhythmically that's happening in his lower body but not quite translating to his upper body. As the dancer begins his performance with a basic salsa step moving side to side, he's lacking a specific attention to an embodiment of the rhythm. He's got a lot of movement, particularly in his pelvis, his arms, and his shoulders. However, the rhythm is really disconnected from this movement, and he overall appears quite awkward and off rhythm, particularly through the use of the upper body, even if that lower body is maintaining connection to the rhythm. It would benefit him here to really clarify that movement, particularly in the shoulders, the pelvis, and the arms. As the dancer is continuing to repeat this basic salsa step, his upper body gets looser and more disjointed with the rhythm and the music, which shows that he might be fatigued or might be really losing that connection to the rhythm that he started out having, particularly in his feet. His loosening up shows that he's feeling maybe a little bit more natural, however he's still lacking that connection to the music. He also is now starting to fall off the rhythm in his feet as well, where before he was able to maintain an embodiment of the rhythm in his feet. He's starting to fatigue and lose that connection quite significantly, which is throwing his dance overall off from the rhythm and really disconnecting him from both the technique of the movement as well as the rhythm of the music. As the dancer continues to perform this basic salsa step, now moving around himself a bit more freely, he's still struggling with refinement in his upper body. His head is really kind of wandering around the space, not necessarily tied to the rhythm of the music or the rhythm that's being enacted in his body. He's also got a fairly free-form arm choreography happening, where his arms are kind of gently floating at his sides and making some sporadic larger movements that don't necessarily make sense with what's happening in the music or in the rest of his body. He also needs to continue to work on refining the pelvis and the shoulders. As the dancer continues with this basic salsa step moving side to side, he still has a lot of movement in his upper body, particularly in his shoulders and in his pelvis, which are moving in a way that really is contradicting one another rhythmically. If he were to connect his movement of his shoulder and all the way down through his torso to his pelvis and refine the movement and choreographies of his arms more specifically, he would appear more on rhythm. He's also performing a really basic step with his feet, which is quite repetitive. If he were to embellish this repetition more with perhaps a changing of his facing or shifting of his weight more deeply, he would show a greater command over the movement technique.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The climber was able to secure the left hand placement and when the palm is facing up towards the hole this is called an undercling and in order to sustain it the climber must pull it towards her and when she does the elbow must stay close to the core. The climber starts when she's no longer standing on the mat and has brought the feet up onto the wall to press down so that she's able to raise the hips towards the wall and is able to transfer her weight to the grips by leaning back. The climber was able to send the left hand but unable to apply the grip to the lip of the hold. As we can see the right foot has also come out of place. This will be inevitable for the climber to sustain the move. The climber we can see has engaged into slow pull-ups. This to bring momentum on swinging so when the climber is ready she will lower her center of gravity, extending the arms and engaging forcefully into a pull-up to perform a dynamic move, sending the left hand over to the next hold at reach. The climber retracted the left hand from the next hold and has come into a match at the initial hold and quickly extends the arms. This is good that the climber leans back and relies on the grips in this moment so that she has some time to recover from her arms being engaged. The climber brings the hands inside of the chalk bag, which is attached to her, to spread the chalk on the surface of the palms. The chalk helps the climber to gain a better grip when sustaining the holds as well as absorbing any moisture that may be coming from her hands. The climber in trying to make the next transition of the right hand over either to the same hole to come into a match or the next hold. We can see how her elbow is not coming close to her core. This is due to her stance being spread out where she will eventually need to transition over to the left. The climber is able to make the left hand placement to the next hold and where she places the hand facing up towards the lip of the hold, sliding the fingers behind the hold as this one is a jug and sends the thumb on the outside, this so that the climber is able to engage into a pinch onto the hold. The climbers is starting at a one-hold start where she places both of the hands into the same hold. This is called matching and the type of hold is called the jug as a climber is able to wrap the hand on the lip of the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

However, overall, this is a moment where she really starts to disconnect from the rhythm, where prior to this she had been very consistently connected.

She's able to incorporate her arms choreographically in a way that's clear and appropriate, maintains a nice soft bend in her knees as she moves through the movements, which is keeping her grounded and stable, and has a lot of clarity in her footwork as well as in the use of her pelvis. As the dancer moves through a couple of different basic salsa steps, as well as some more creative or freestyle moments, she really struggles to what appears to be remember the choreography. So this could be resolved with just some additional rehearsal so that she has a deeper understanding of the choreography, as well as how to transition from one phrase to the next. Here the dancer struggles to transition from this stationary step-touch movement into a box step which will locomote her through the space a bit more.

Overall, some additional rehearsal to find this clarity in the transition would be beneficial. As the dancer transitions into this step that's starting to locomote her through the space a little bit more, she could use a bit of additional rehearsal through the transition.

Again, his follow-through is really high. You know, we want that follow-through to be in this, in the ego view here. We should be able to see this arm laid out here. Better going up on the balls of the feet. I still love to see him jump and use more legs. Here's the shot. Again, this looks really nice. See that guide hand? It's kind of almost... It's not on top of the ball. It was on the side, but then he pulls it back toward him and up. We just need it to stay down and to stay in place. It doesn't really move. Good extension. Love to see him jump. I love his... He's square to the basket. This looks really nice. Here's again, the shooting arm is not so bad. It looks, actually looks pretty good here. Maybe elbow in a tad. I like the snapping of the wrist. Again, get this guide arm down. We don't want it coming across the body. Good extension. We'd love to see him get off the ground here. A lot of his shots are hitting the front of the rim. That tells me he needs more lower body, more legs, more power. Again, his follow-through does bend the knees a little bit, a lot better. But see, his follow-through is straight up. It needs to be more arced, like following this basketball to the rim. See his follow-through, it's way up high. Could throw off the spin of the ball as it makes its way to the basket. Here, he's got a follow through that's really high, because you can't even see his follow through. You should be able to see his follow through in this picture. His follow through is really high. He probably has way too much arc on the ball. And then he kind of locks it out, flat-footed. My suggestion is follow the, that your arm should be bent, or you know, following the ball to the basket. Drop, being real light on the hips and knees and feet. Go to Beadaholique.com for all of your beading supply needs! Here again, then he pauses. I mean, he's going to be defended. In a game, you don't have time to do all that. If it is a free throw, I like how his feet are set, one foot in front of the other. That right foot's in front because he's a right-hand shooter. He drops his hips a little. He takes a deep breath, I'm sure, looks at the target. Again, if this is a free throw, it looks really nice. You know, knees are bent, staggered stance. He's dropping his hips, eyeing his target. That ball's out in front. His vision takes his eyes over on top of the ball, across to the rim. But in a game, if this is a jump shooting drill, like a jump shot, you don't have time to do all this. You've got to catch and shoot before this defender guards you. Here's his shot. Pretty good. Maybe right elbow in a little bit. I love how it comes off the pads of these fingers. Again, let's drop that left elbow and get that hand should be more over here facing in. He goes up on the balls of his feet. We'd love to see him get off the ground and lift his body up. Here's the shot. Again, good extension of the elbow. Maybe just get that right elbow in a little bit. I love the follow-through, snapping of the wrist, fingers are down. This guide arm needs to come in. It's just really high and across the body. You know, we just want to keep that elbow bent. It really doesn't do anything. All its work is helping get the ball up to where you want to release it. Good extension of the hips. Free throw would be great going up on the balls of the feet, but overall I think he really needs to use a lot more of his legs. Here the shooter is shooting a 15-foot jump shot. It looks like he's shooting a free throw, so, because he's not jumping, he took two dribbles. Yeah, I don't know if it's a, if it is a free throw, that's okay. You don't need to jump. You don't need, you could take one or two dribbles because you have 10 seconds to shoot the basketball. But in the jump shooting drill, we need to jump, and I would love to see him use his legs more to lift this ball to the basket. You know, the ball coming off his shooting arm and hand, not too bad. I get this right elbow in a tad. I love this, how it comes off these pads of the fingers. The left arm maybe coming across the body a little bit too much. You see that hand. We'd love that elbow to be bent, that forearm parallel, that palm of that left non-shooting hand facing the other arm. I can't tell if he's using it in his shot, but it does come across his body here. Again, here's a shooting hand behind the ball that looks good. I just think this guide arm, we need some work with the guide arm. We need to drop this elbow, but the hand comes off. It just comes off. He pulls it back, it looks like, instead of just letting the hand be, and the ball just kind of shoots through that hand. But I love the 90 degree, good body control. Again, I love to see him step into a pass one time and jump. Not bad snapping of the wrist, maybe point those fingers, maybe the right elbow comes in a tad. Again, let's get this left shooting, non-shooting arm down. Good extension here. Goes up on the balls of his feet. Again, if this is a free throw, this technique looks good. But if it's a game like, you've got to get off the ground and shoot over this defender. Again, he begins his shot. He does have his left hand here on the side, maybe a little looser grip here. You don't want your left non-shooting guide hand to grip the basketball. Just real light, soft pressure. But I like that. I like bending the knees, dropping the hips. He's got that ball sitting on that right hand, that elbow's 90 degree, and he's looking over the rim, over the ball at the rim. Again, here's the shot on a free throw, going up on the balls of the feet is nice, but again, if it's a jump shooting drill, we need to use more legs and get more power and lift, jump, but not bad here. Again, that left hand comes across. We need to keep it down in here. Your guide arm really is not in the shot. It just stays there, the elbow bent, balancing the ball in this hand. Again, you know, if this is a free throw, this is fine, but if it's a jump shooting drill, it needs to be more like game-like, catch and shoot. You don't have time to dribble it and look down at it. See how he's looking down? When you look down, you take your eyes off your target. It's so important to maintain eye contact with your target instead of staring at the basketball. My suggestion is don't dribble, catch and shoot as quick as possible before you're defended.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This is really useful because the more the climber understands the intention and sequence of the climb before they pull off the ground, the more efficient they'll be able to be on the wall and more likely they'll be successful. Yeah, we see the climber attempt to recover this by coming back to the start hold, but that downward motion takes a lot of momentum and it just pulls them off the wall. So we see a climber established with both feet on the wall. Because they want to be able to put more pressure into the left foot, they almost immediately take the right foot off and end up moving it into a slightly flagged position. This is helpful but not super necessary. It's only a matter of a couple of inches and they're moving their foot, so if they kept it pressed and keep pressure on it in the other foot position, they would be fine there as well. So something a little strange as we see the climber just kind of directly pointing with one finger Generally what we would want to see here is the climber pantomiming the hold Position with their hand and how they expect to hold it And it gives them a better idea of what to do with each hold and it helps them keep To the intended left right left sequence finish then how each hand is supposed to be positioned on each hold", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The interesting thing to me is that Clemmer isn't pinching it. You have both thumbs wrapped over the top of it here. I believe there is a left foot for the start as well. And the climber attempts to pull into this tufa hold here and gets around it but just is not able to actually utilize the usable surface of the hold. That's probably because they're feeling uncomfortable on this left hand pinch. I don't know this climber, maybe they're not, maybe pinches are not part of their repertoire, but nevertheless they get the reach but not quite the usable surface here and then they fall off the boulder.

That enables the piano player to have more control. As she was playing this last thing, she sort of skipped over the note right there, and so there wasn't a very clear attack to each of those notes, so she didn't push down hard enough into the keys to get a clearer sound. So she could have gotten a more clear sound by pushing in a little bit more, giving a little bit more weight, and starting each note with a more precise attack or a precise start to the note. Now what she just did is that she played both hands together. So she demonstrated that the right hand has a different fingering than the left hand. And so she played it very slowly to make sure that she did it accurately. And she did it accurately with the right fingerings, but the notes could have been more even and more connected. Right here she's demonstrating playing the scale with her left hand and normally your left hand is supposed to go one two three four five and then your third finger your middle finger but for some reason she used her ring finger right here for this note and that is not the correct fingering for the scale. She still played the correct note but the fingering was the incorrect finger. She kept a pretty curved hand shape with her left hand as she went up and down the fingerboard right or the keyboard right here and she did it with a pretty smooth and connected sound thanks to her curved hand shape and she was able to find the different positions on the keyboard very accurately so that sounded pretty clear. As she is demonstrating playing octaves with her right hand, her thumb is right here and then her pinky is supposed to be pressing down this note, but she accidentally pressed down two notes at a time. As you can see, her right pinky is pressing down that note and then it's pressing down this note as well. So that is a little bit of her hand just reaching a little bit too far. So that precision could be a little bit better with her hand shape. As she's going down the scale with both hands, she accidentally played the incorrect fingering with her right hand. Right here, her pointer finger is playing that C, but she should have her thumb there if she's playing it with the correct fingering. She just played a C major scale with her right hand using all of these white keys, and she did it with the correct fingering, meaning she used the right fingers for each note. So for the C major scale on the right hand, she uses her first, second, third finger, and then her hand moves over, and then she plays her first, second, third, fourth, and fifth fingers, and she did that with the accurate fingering. She demonstrated that she could practice the skill of putting both hands together with the correct fingerings by playing it slower, which is a good strategy for practicing. Now the second time that she played it, she used her middle finger to play that note, that finger to play that note, and that finger to play that note, and that is the correct fingering, and so she corrected herself, and so that is what fingers that are traditionally used for that scale with that hand. As for the left hand, she used the correct fingering, but when she shifted over to play from G to the A, she accidentally overshot and she accidentally played the B and kind of skipped a note as her hand moved positions. So that was something that she played inaccurately because her hand wasn't in the right spot.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

However, this is difficult for her because her right foot being in place keeps her right side close to the wall so it makes it a lot more lengthy to send the left hand up for the reach. Reason why she is not able to wrap her fingers above the edge of the hold. Now the left leg is not positioned into any foot chips and instead is extended. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. We can see the climber bringing her right knee in and doing a twist of her body to send her center of gravity over to the right as she was planning to release the right hand to go up to the next hold. The climber making hand gestures is so that she's able to visualize the holds on the route as performing hand placements and how the body will need to move when at that section of the wall. The climber keeping her right side being the right hand and the right foot being in place towards the wall was applying a lot of force to send the left hand out for the reach. This is because the climber is forcing her center of gravity over to the opposite direction making it impossible to make the holder reach and she has done this dynamically where she had engaged onto the right foot bringing her center of gravity close to the wall on the opposite direction where her left hand was going to and has engaged onto forcefully twisting her left shoulder so that she was able to bring her hand up for the reach. This actually can apply a lot of force onto the right shoulder making it tired so the climber has come off the wall and sit on the mat and didn't climb. The climber chooses to retract from almost performing the move, sending the right hand up while bringing the hip over to the right side and retracts the move to perform a foot switch. It's important that the climber always glances down when performing a new foot placement or doing a foot switch. Where she has brought the right toe to come close to where her left foot is And she's performing a common technique of foot switching where she jumps off the left toe out of place to bring the right toe to jump where the left toe was, being placed above the foothold. This is a method or technique of foot switching that is the most commonly used and it works but at times it's really hard to make the placement accurate, especially in a small foothold. At the same time, this takes a fair bit of energy when being performed. The climber is starting at a one-hold start where she places both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching. And now we can see how she is ascending to the lip of the hold. With a slight indent into the hold, the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold. And to apply extra pressure, the climber secures the grip by placing the thumbs at the bottom of it to squeeze the hold. After she has secured the grip, we can see how the climber was able to transfer over the weight, keeping the arms extended and pulling onto the hold. As she brings her feet onto a rise, where she places the left foot slightly lower on the wall and brings the right foot over a distance to be pushed away. Now the climber, in pushing down the feet, she is able to raise the hips and is glancing over at the next hold at reach.

So in this position he is hanging on with the right hand here as well as utilizing a left foot in this position. It's a little bit hard to say exactly what's going on with his right foot because I can't clearly see it in this image, but what we can focus on is that the climber is doing his best to stand up with that left foot. The only thing I wish to see is a little bit more transitioning of his body weight over onto that left side because what I ended up seeing in this image right here is that as the climber reached up to that left hand we can kind of see that his head almost kind of shot back showing that there was a lot of body weight kind of being shifted backwards. So this does completely rely on the climber being able to hang on to that left hand in order to complete this movement. So that kind of shows to me that the climber is relying a little bit on his right arm and what it's doing. So that kind of shows to me that he is pulling quite a bit with it, but as he moved up with his left hand there was a lot of body weight for him to control just solely on his right arm because he's not entirely incorporating his lower body into this movement. So again he's continuing to use his upper body, but because he's been doing that this could lead to him being extremely tired and making it much harder to complete this movement which is why his head kind of shot back showing his fatigue through this continuing of the powerful movement. So here we can see the climber is able to reach over to the first hold with his left hand in this position. So what the climber was able to do is hang on with his right hand on the starting handhold here. And he was able to utilize a left foot on this starting foothold here. So because the climber is using opposite points of contact, he is able to kind of get a good balance of his posture, which is going to be centered between those two points. So what the climber is able to do is he's able to transition a lot of his body weight over that left foot to try and guide his body in the direction that he needs to. But what we see going on is the climber is focusing a lot on how much he's pulling with that right arm in order to complete this movement. So this is using up quite a bit of energy on his upper body. And I would encourage the climber to kind of straighten out his arm, so then that way he can focus a lot more on his legs doing the majority of the work, as opposed to his arms. And so here we can see from that position the clamber tried to bump his left hand up into this next handhold position And the way he did that was He kept his body in the same exact position as the previous move and being that the previous move was already pretty difficult on the clamber to begin with Demonstrating that he was using a lot of power on his right arm Doing this move in this fashion Probably is not the most recommended for the clamber Also, because it did lead to his fall So what I would recommend for the climbers in the previous position I would encourage him to try and figure out a new foot position Try and adjust his body weight to where it needs to be So then that way he has a better opportunity of reaching up to this pink hold a little bit better Because by allowing yourself as a climber to just kind of extend yourself and reach up to the next better handhold Could make it possible for you to continue climbing But typically makes you lead into a fall or puts you in a really bad position Even more difficult to continue moving So I would always encourage climbers to find a better foot position kind of in a higher position So then that way you set yourself up for the next move and can continue climbing afterwards And so here we can see the clamber was able to move his right hand up into this next handhold So in this position he is hanging on with the left hand here as well as utilizing a right foot in this position Um, so because he's using opposite points of contact that are lined up with each other This does allow the clamber to get into a move called a back step in where he's able to rotate the right side of his Body closer to the wall so he's able to reach over with this right hand a little bit easier I'm in the main purpose of the back step is to utilize his legs much more in throughout the movement And so we can see that the clamber is sitting down on his right leg Making sure that his right knee is pointed over to the left and this helps to kind of get that rotation that he is Trying to get with the right side of getting closer to the wall And then on top of that you also need to make sure you utilize a really good a flagging foot So this clamber's flag foot is pretty good But straight intentional kind of being placed up against the wall so as this helps to create tension throughout the entire body And but again, we can see that the clamber is focusing a lot on his pulling power with his left arm in this instance Um, so again, he's using quite a bit of energy And so I would recommend that he strains out his arm a little bit more so he can allow his legs to do the majority of the work", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Here the player is stood too upright, very little bend in his knees. This makes changing direction difficult when we get to higher speeds. Players should be sitting a little bit lower in these sequences as they practice getting faster and faster. Players push the ball too far forwards with their left foot, so instead of the ball travelling between the cones as it should, it's gone forward towards the cone. player is trying to change direction and go into there, but they're not in control of the ball. They're just reaching for it and reacting to it. A better choice we'd want the player to do here is after his touch that moves the ball across, that he takes two steps as he would just as he's walking. And then this puts his body behind the ball and allows him in a better moment to actually move it across into the direction that he's going to go.

Players use the sole of their right foot to roll the ball across and away from their body here. This is not necessarily that effective. We would much prefer this right foot to be planted and then use the left leg to roll over the ball, which allows them to stay in balance, have their feet appropriately planted and allow their body to move with the ball as it travels. The player has shown good instinct by reaching out with the right foot, sole of the foot stops the ball, then you can now drag the ball back and put it back on the course in which it was supposed to go. This is a good piece of instinctive action by the player. The player is keeping the ball too close to their body. It's under their feet at all times. We'd want the ball to be at least a foot outside of their body so they can move their feet around and actually change direction with the ball and slalom in and out of the cones as desired.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This hand is on the far outside edge of the hold, so they're losing already like, you know, eight inches of space that they could get closer to. They can really turn the left hip in as they reach through. This is a much more distant way of doing the move.

The climber is then able to get this hold right here underneath this big orange rail and then surf the right foot out. This is a good foot so the climber can pull really hard this direction on it. I like this move because the climber has to get up and over this tufa rail so it makes the move pretty spicy is what we would call it. You kind of have to slam into this right hand because you're falling away so you have to over accentuate a little bit and it's a nice move. A lot of people don't like this instance on spray walls. That's why you don't see a ton of big holds on a traditional spray wall but I do like this aspect of it. Here we have the climber matched on this down pulling. It's not quite a jug, but it is in-cut, kind of a rounded in-cut rail hold. And then right foot's pasted on this hold, foothold just above the kicker. The climber then switches feet from right to left in order to flag the right foot really far out, get all their weight underneath this right hand, and that's what allows the climber to come in and match just above the hold that they're on. I say match, it's not technically a match, but when you have two holds really close like this, you sometimes describe it as a match. Anyway, the climber then switches their feet again to the right foot, and here they are pulling again really hard in this direction with this foot, dropping this knee in, and anticipating a right move out. Their laser pointer was hovering over this hold. And after the start, the climber just punches up into this right hand. Pretty small move, kind of a setup move for this next sequence. The climber just campuses the left foot into a foot to the right of the plane of the body and then posts the flag out with the right foot, which is a back step. That allows the climber to kind of turn the shoulders over, turn the hips over, and even avoid a deeper lock off and is able to get up into this hold, which is a sideways hold, but it is a jug, so you can pretty much just down pull it.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I would encourage them to also include their rib cage in that movement so it feels more salsa-esque. I think the dancer could incorporate more shoulder and chest here as well as more hip articulation to make it more exciting to watch. For this step step, I would like to see the dancer really think about accentuating from staccato to this melting action and really circulating these hips that I've talked about in a couple of other videos. Here's a moment where they could definitely be more grounded and they'll be able to articulate those hips even further. The dancer turns and they do a good job of spotting, but they're not always in control of their turns. And it kind of sways a little bit. So to be in more control of not just where they land, but having the ability to stop themselves from turning, they need to engage their core. I would like to see the dancer work on the balls of their feet so they're not slipping and sliding, but they're really in control of their step pivot.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

His feet are still in the same position which are kind of spread out from his left side and over to his right side. So this is just showing a good demonstration that he's able to distribute his body weight between those two feet. But what we're noticing that as soon as he grabs onto that left hand hold, we can see that it's kind of in a U-shape hold and it's flat and rounded on top of it. So this is what we call a sloper and where typically a climber wants to increase the amount of friction that they're placing on that hold and this gives them the best chance of hanging on to that hand hold. But as a climber pulls up into a sloper, it typically actually makes it worse. So we can see with this climber he's naturally pulling in with that left hand just because he wants to try and reinforce how much he's hanging on to that hold. But this does naturally make it a little bit harder for him to be able to complete. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing his right hand into the next handhold here. So in this position he is having to pull in with this undercling pocket hold that he's holding on to. And that's kind of typical with an undercling hold, just because you are having to pull up into it to make the best use of it. And so for this climber, it does seem like he's pretty comfortable getting himself in a somewhat extended position, just probably because he is a pretty tall climber. But for shorter climbers, I would definitely say that by placing his right foot in this low position here, might be a little bit too low. So I would always encourage climbers to find a higher right foot that would help promote them in their movement. Because not only do you want to think about the movement that they're completing, but you also want to think about the following moves. So if a shorter climber attempted to do this move with the same right foot that this climber is using, that kind of naturally places them in a very extended position and could make it hard for them to continue to move from any further movement. So that's why I would always encourage climbers to find a higher foot, so then that way they can continue keeping control of their body. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing his right hand over into the next handhold here. So he is demonstrating a proper lock off with his left arm. So lock off is when your elbow is kind of in a 90 degree angle or closer to the wall. So here we see that the climber is doing a really good demonstration of that. And the trick with that is helping to transfer his body weight over his right foot so that he can continue to reinforce the direction that he wants to go to. So this is a really good demonstration to see from the climber. So here I believe is where the climber has the best opportunity to be able to finish the boulder. So he does have a high right heel hook and he's still hanging on with that left arm. So we can see that his left arm is still slightly extended, or slightly flexed rather, and I would actually encourage the climber to make sure that he actually extends his arm as much as possible. So then that way he's no longer having to pull on that left hand hold and it actually helps to encourage to hang on to the hold in the best way possible by keeping his arm in an extended position. So I would definitely encourage the climber to also flag his left foot directly underneath him and this would kind of help him to encourage his heel hook and the use of it because by using that heel hook a little bit more properly he should be able to kind of adjust his body weight between his left hand and that right heel which will then allow him the opportunity of bringing his right hand over into that final hand hold. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring in his right hand into the next handhold here. So in this position the climber was able to still keep his high right foot, but he also was able to place a low left foot as well. So by getting himself in this position here, this does allow him to kind of distribute his bodyweight evenly between those two feet he's utilizing. And then he's also doing a good job of making sure there's arms in a straight position so that he's having to relax his arms and not having to pull and engage them, which uses up a lot of energy quickly. And so here we can see the Clamor was able to make the next small move of bringing his left hand over into the screen hold here. So in this position he is hanging on with the right hand here and he was able to get a high right foot as well. So because he's using two points of contact that are on the same side of each other, this does kind of naturally place him in an imbalanced position. Just because his body kind of runs to rotate around those two points. So what the Clamor is doing is with his left foot he is flagging it down into the right. And so this helps to encourage placing a lot of his body weight on that high right foot. And then the trick with doing all this is making sure that his body weight is directly underneath his right arm. So then that way he's not having to pull or engage it and this also helps to reduce the natural rotation that his body is experiencing right here. But what we can see is that as the Clamor is reaching in with the left hand, he's kind of pulling in a little bit with that right arm. But because the move is pretty small, he's not having to pull on it too much. So here we can see the clamber was able to make the first move of bringing his left hand over to the first holder right over here. And in this position we can see that the clamber was having to pull in with both of his arms and that could be just because his left foot is in a starting position that's very high. So what that does is it naturally kind of forces his hip to sit out and away from the wall and so because he's so close to the ground he doesn't really want to touch the ground because of it in his attempt so that's kind of forcing him to have to engage his arms. That could be the main reason why he's having to pull with them to be able to complete this first move here. And so here we can see the climber was able to move his left hand up into the next handhold here So in this position he is hanging on with the right hand here as well as using a left foot on the wall right here So because he's using opposite points of contact with the wall and they're a little spread out from each other This does allow him to get really good control of his movements so that he's able to transfer his body We comfortably over his left foot But what we see happening is the climber is allowing his left knee to kind of be pointed towards the wall And what this does is it pulls the rest of his body away from the wall and kind of naturally forces him to have to Engage with his right arm a little bit Um, so it's kind of hard to say if he's doing that exactly but I would kind of argue that he is being forced to Pull in with his right arm, but it could be fairly comfortable for this climber to do that And then here we can see the clamor was able to bring his left hand up into the next held here. So this seems to be like an undercling pocket hold. A pocket is typically where you can only put like one, two, or three fingers inside of a hold. And it can be a little bit of a dangerous hold to hang on to just because there's so much pressure being applied to the tendons and ligaments inside your fingers. So if a foot slips while hanging onto a pocket, it could lead to injuries. But here in this case, we can see that the clamor is doing a really good job of making sure that he's allowing his body weight to hang back away from those holds with a straight arm position. And this helps to encourage his arms to be in a more relaxed state while his legs are in a bent position. And this kind of reinforces that a lot of his body weight is being placed on his legs. And that's kind of always an important thing to have. And so here we can see the climber was able to come over for matching his hold. And so one of the important things that in this position the climber was able to demonstrate was that he was able to demonstrate that he can transfer his body weight over to the left. And the main trick to that is making sure that majority of his body weight is placed underneath his left arm. And that's always an important thing to do is making sure that you transition your body weight appropriately before committing to a hand move. So that way you get really good control of what's going on with your body weight and then your hands aren't having to try and compensate with any extra swinging that could happen.
