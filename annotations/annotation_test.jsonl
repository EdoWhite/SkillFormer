Now, what should be done here, it could be one of two things. One, sharpen the blade on the anjali, or two, to use a chef's knife and a cutting board. Either way, the blades need to be very, very sharp, especially when cutting tomatoes. Here the anjali works very well for cutting the cucumber. However, it's always recommended when you are cutting any round vegetables that you generally cut them in half, in this case lengthwise for the cucumber, and put the flat side down on the cutting board. That way you eliminate any potential for rolling of the vegetable and also the potential for cutting yourself if that happens. So oil and seasonings were added to the tomatoes and cucumbers, which is fabulous. You want to do seasonings. However, the individual did not taste the finished product to see if seasonings were adjusted correctly. So always at the end of making any dish, the dish should be tasted and seasonings adjusted accordingly. What I notice here is that the blade of the Anjali might be a bit dull because you can see him having to pull the cucumber away from the blade after the cut is made.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

The dancer is also looking down here, which is not he does this quite a bit through the routine And he sees the floor in his view Which should not be the case. He should be looking straight ahead, especially as an ending position It's not very strong to be looking downward This is another example of the dancer's arms being bent right now. It's only slightly bent. It's better but not completely straight. But we see that his arm is in a bit of a curve so he really needs to work on straightening those elbows completely. The dancer continues to look downward. He really should be looking straight ahead. He's changing his spinal alignment because his vertebrae is aligned from his waist to his shoulders but then his neck is tilted forward so it's misaligned here. The dancer is turning on flat feet. He needs to be turning on his toes with his heel instead lifted off the ground The dancer is starting the routine right before the actual choreography begins with great energy. He's shimmying his shoulders to a great extent. He's stepping down with a lot of authority in his movement, so that's really good that he's starting on this energy level so long as he sustains it throughout. The dancer does not extend his left arm here fully. It should be in a straight line. Also, in looking downward like this, he blocks his face with his right arm. His right arm is right in front of him and his eyes are at the same level as his arms. So from an audience perspective and watching, it would be hard to see his face because his arm is basically blocking his face. The dancer exits his ending pose very quickly. He had his arms out to the side. Towards his left, he brings them down quickly. So it's not really clear that the routine is over, especially because it's the last step of the dance. He really wants to end strongly and should be holding that pose. Again, the dancer's arms are bent and not extended all the way.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She also uses it to square her body up, pulls that right knee, everything's in line with the basket. Here you get, here's a good look of the guide hand coming off that left hand, shooting hand behind the ball. Really working hard here again, good footwork here to get this really nice angle. She's not too far out, not too far under. Nice, nice look here. Again, good footwork, push off that left foot. I really wish she could drive this right knee up. It's nothing wrong with what she's doing. Let's drive that right knee up to lift us even further. Again, she's a little, you know, a little close here to the rim. Maybe a little bit too close, but good extension here. I love she's got that shooting hand behind the basketball. She may be a little too close to the rim here to finish off the glass. Again, nice footwork, left foot take off, pull that right knee up. Good extension of the right arm, the shooting arm, elbows extended, shooting hand behind the basketball, balls out in front of that hand, eyes are up. Good angle here to finish. Here's that lift and extension. Nice. Let's snap that wrist down. The ball's in a pretty good position here to go in. Extends those hips and legs. Nice job. But does finish strong here. Good extension here. A little better snapping follow-through. That ball is out in front of that hand, which is what you want to see. She's got that arm bar out here to help balance her body. Maybe bend it a little bit, kind of at 90 degree, potentially hold off a defender there. uses a big dribble here to push off, right leg going up, maybe a little off balance here, maybe went off a little bit too soon here, that's something I was thinking about in her scoring. Sometimes her takeoff's a little too soon, doesn't allow her to have the angle to finish, so she's really having to put the ball in the palm of her hand and kinda lift the ball up just because of the footwork spacing is a little off here. Yeah, much better take off here. She can really pull that right hip up. Does a good job of really squaring up her body. Gets that shooting hand behind the basketball. Very well done. Again, here she took off a little bit too soon, maybe in front of the rim a little bit too much, but does a great job of planning the correct foot. It's just the spacing here, you know, what the angle we're trying to achieve here. Again, takes it up with two hands, much more a strong basketball player here, better control, better stability here. I love she's looking up, keeping her eye on the target. Here's that shot. Again, love how she's got her hand behind the ball. You see the fingers nice and spread, balls out in front of her. She's got some ups here too. She can really get up off the ground and very well done. Beautiful look here. Really does a great job of extending and reaching balls out in front. Very nice. Beautiful footwork. Here's that bent right knee lifting. Good power and up. She's going hard. I like that. Nice job. Here the shooter is moving left to right, shooting a right hand reverse layup. Pretty good timing and spacing here, going off the correct foot, the left foot, and raising that right knee. I like how she's also pivoting on the left foot, and it kind of gets her square to the baseline or to the basket. She's got that guide hand on the left side of the ball with that right hand. It's hard to see the right hand, but it looks like it might be a little under the ball. Would love it to be more behind the ball, but I love how she takes it up with two hands. She's strong, aggressive here, really doing a good job of stabilizing that ball for the shot. Uh, it looks like that ball slipped out of her hand here. You can tell it's going to hit rim. So again, you know, I don't know why sometimes it slips. Keeping that left hand on there a little bit longer, spreading the fingers on the basketball, keeping your eye on this target. It looks like her footwork looks really good here. It's just she's off target here. And, you know, her momentum, I mean, she's hitting that square. It's nice, but look where she is. Because she's coming full speed here. Again, it's all about, you know, being explosive, going game speed, but at the same time, you know, you don't want to land way under the basket. You know, the reason why is that ball could be missed. You're out of position, if you will. She's a little off balance. Might take her a little time more to recover. So not an easy thing to do. I mean, as she goes up, she's got to be able to come down and not let that momentum really take her out of bounds. Again, it's working hard to get this angle. Much better angle spacing here. See where that, instead of planning here, she planned it here. I love the guide hand, help take it up and then it comes off. See that? She had two hands lifting. Left hand is there, comes off softly. Good lift here. Good angle, good spacing. See how she's lifting it, that hand's under the ball. Again, it's gonna throw off some of the accuracy here. And then you can see how her feet are kind of, she's pushing off, but that right leg's really pulled out to the right. We want to square our hips, our torso to the basket. Here's the finish. Does got some up here. I love how she's getting up. Good extension of the shooting elbow. We'd like that her to snap that wrist down though and follow through. Put the balls in a good position here to hit the rim and go in. She is leaning here a little bit. Okay though, she's got, she had a lot of momentum coming in here. Just continue to balance yourself. Have good body control. You got to be able to be go, be able to go hard and fast but at the same time have some poise and body control.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So in this position the climber is hanging on with the right hand here, as well as utilizing a right foot in this position. So because the climber is using two points of contact and on the same side of his body, this naturally places his body in an imbalanced position, where his body kind of wants to rotate around those two points. So what the climber has to do is a couple things in order to compensate for that. One of the things is utilizing a flagging foot, so his left foot is flagging out to the right. And what this does is it helps to bring a little bit of his body weight over into the right side of those two points of contact. So in that way there's a little bit less of an imbalance going on. And then on top of that the climber is forced to have to pull in with his right arms, because we do see his right arm is in a very flexed position. And this is mainly to try and keep his body forward and central to the wall, so that way again he's not rotating outwards and to the right. So this does require a lot of power and a lot of energy to be able to accomplish a move like this. So this can make it a little bit more difficult to complete his boulder if he continues climbing into moves like this. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring his right hand over into this next handhold. So he's now matched on it. And in this position, what we can see the climber doing is he's making sure that a lot of his body weight is directly underneath his left arm before bringing in his right hand, which is always a good thing to see. So what the climber is able to do is kind of push out with his right foot in order to transition his body weight over to the left. And again, that's to prevent any further swinging from occurring as he brings his right hand up into this next handhold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

But you can see how, how like the strength of that turn, not really efficient. Like he's over, over hitting the ball with too much pace, which causes him to now overextend. And you have this really stretched position here where he has limited contact with the, with the ground. He has no force going into the ground because his feet are so wide. So like he's not moving anywhere essentially at this point. He's just trying to overcorrect and catch the ball at this point, which is slowing down the entire action and his ability to control the ball. So consistent theme with him, slow down, keep the ball in front of your body, use a consistent surface to touch the ball out in front of your body and try to move with the ball. And then gradually as he becomes more comfortable, he can gain speed. So for a dribbling activity, him popping the ball up into the air right here and trying to juggle it is actually not part of it. I just wanted to point that out that if it were evaluating dribbling, this wouldn't be a technique that we would use. We want that ball down on the ground and him dribbling the ball and moving with it in a forward direction. So this is a move that he's constantly using or a skill as he gets into this stance here. You see this leg knee bent Loaded and he keeps the ball far away from his body and the outside of it as opposed to close to him and he's doing that by putting his foot on top of the ball and then rolling this foot off the ball and Now that puts them on the inside of his foot This would be actually like a useful skill if it were a shielding activity If you imagine a player being right here That would protect the ball a lot by giving a lot of space between where the ball is and the opponent and he's in a Good balanced position to make contact with that opponent and fend that opponent off So that's what this skill would be really useful for in terms of like just dribbling efficiently through a space and turning I it's not really one that we would practice or recommend But again, just pointing out what this skill is and critiquing the skill from what that looks like He's quite comfortable and in the shielding almost like a shielding skill To keep the ball away from an opponent Yeah, this is a good picture for a sole roll. You can see that his body is leaning in this direction, hips moving that way, upper body is moving that way. But I like that his head's down, it's tracking the ball and he's got his arms out to the side on both sides here. That helps for balance. And he's contacting the ball at the top and rolling it over with his sole, the bottom of his foot across the front of his body. And that's good. And you see that back foot is pivoted already in the direction that he wants to go. So I like that. And this is a good picture then for a sole roll of what it should look like, nice and clean. And this is kind of what's happening again continuously throughout the activity because he's trying to move faster with his feet and his body than he's actually manipulating the ball. He gets caught ahead of the ball at this point and now the ball is underneath him and he's very off balance. Everything in his body is going this way and he has no control of the ball at this point because he's not contacting the ball. So slowing down would help him and also keeping the ball in front of him and using a consistent technique to do that, whether that be the instep or the laces that just push the ball every step forward. I think that would really help him to be able to move more efficiently and with more control. A little useful skill here in changing direction as he's going this way here and then trying to go this way here next. Just using a top of the foot or bottom of the foot sole pull or a turn. He's dragging the ball backwards here this direction by placing his foot directly on top of the ball in the center part of it and just pulling it backwards towards his body. So a really effective way to do that. I like his upper body here. Got a nice forward lean. See the knees bent nice and soft there. So he can turn and pivot on that plant foot pretty quickly then from this position. Yeah, here, I mean, he's just doing turns with the ball here. In terms of like dribbling, this is just a technique to keep the ball away from a direct opponent if somebody was trying to get him. He's actually showing okay balance as he's doing this. I don't mind it. It's not really related to what we've seen so far from him. This is sort of a one-off, but a nice technique where he's just catching it with the inside of his foot and dragging it around his body here and almost doing a 360 with the ball. He's keeping that ball nice and tight to him. It's a little bit underneath him at this point. He would likely need to start pivoting on this foot a little bit more, a little more this way actually and start turning that heel this way to bring his body in that direction. The subject's performing a close control, freestyle dribbling activity where just in the space pretty much he can sort of dribble anywhere he wants to go using any skill that he wants to. The four cones that are laid out don't necessarily have any indication of like an exercise or what he should be doing. It's just he can kind of go wherever he wants to go and use whatever surface of the foot that he wants to. So we'll evaluate his control, his ability to run with the ball, his ability to turn, his balance, his coordination with the ball. These are the things that we'll try to look at as we go through this video. Yeah, I mean, this is what you don't want to have happen in this, in a dribbling exercise like this, as that ball gets away from you, it's very far off because he took a very strong touch as he tried to soul roll and catch the ball there. Now the ball's going outside of the cones, coned area, or so he's lost control of it. And so this is just, again, slowing his actions down a little bit. His feet are trying to move a lot faster than how he's manipulating the ball and what he's actually capable of considering his skill level and ability. So I would just recommend that he slow down and try to be a little bit more calmer, keep the ball out in front of him, keep it close to his body, and perhaps simplify some of the touches that he's taking. He could do that by just giving himself some direction. If he started here and dribbled to here and then turned and then restarted and went back the other direction, perhaps that could be a lot easier way for him to get some good repetition at a skill and keep it in front of him, more like running in a game. He gets stuck in these moments at times by just trying to take too many touches with his inside or sole of the foot. And here, this is an off balance moment where he's trying to contact the ball with his right foot. That right foot is basically on top of his left foot. As you can see, and that left knee is like inward, it's caving in this direction here, actually. So he's very off balance. Upper body is leaning this way as he's trying to push the ball and go that way as opposed to leaning in the direction that he wants to go, which would be preferred. So sometimes these moments, if he just slows down and what he's trying to do and not do it at such a fast speed, I think it would benefit a lot to keep that ball out in front of him. And if the ball is going to come across his body like this, it's okay to just use that left foot to control it, keep better balance with that right foot, keep his hips more aligned in the direction that he's trying to go. So right away, he's using an inside the foot technique where he's going across his body, across his body with the inside of the foot as he's just dribbling throughout the space. And one thing that just happened as you're doing that, you can see that he hit it across his body to his right foot and he wants to do the same thing to keep moving to bring it back to his left foot. But where he's striking the ball is very high on the ball. You can see like this is the center line of the ball. He's striking it very high in the ball, which will end up being more of a sole roll across his body, which he's not intentionally trying to do because if it was a sole roll, he would lean much more in that direction and roll the ball with him as he moves in that direction. But you can see in the picture that he's very upright. So this is just, this is going to lead to an error. And so what I would just recommend that if he's going to dribble with the inside of his feet only, that he tried to contact the ball very consistently in the center part of the ball to get it to come across his body.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This will help the climber to drive the force of direction and closeness to the hold when going up for the leap to the next hold. The climb will start until the feet are placed onto the wall. At this point, none of the limbs and his body is touching the mat. That means that the climb will start. As we can see, both of the feet are positioned at a high stance, and as we can see also, the climber is bringing his center of gravity low by keeping the arms extended and not engaging on the shoulders. The next hold, seeming to be a hold that is far away, will make the climber have to engage into a dynamic, powerful stance. This is called a dyno. If the climber was going to do this again, it's important that he focuses on the right application when at the grips down below and also on the foot placement. This one because when the climber gets to make a full stance and keeps his chest forward as he once did, it's important that he lets his center of gravity be lined on top of the right foot. Because the climber has reached a certain height when taking up the flight, he needs to press down on the right foot and continue to engage his core to stay close to the wall following the movement of the chest. In this case, the climber had pressed down on the right foot, but the right foot had slipped off. It was crucial that the climber keeps the pressure on it and stays as close as he can to the wall to avoid from bringing his center of gravity away from the wall and having to land on the mat before reaching the hold. The climber is shaking his hands. This is potentially because the climber had already attempted to climb and so is shaking the hands to release any tension that might have been built up as well as warming up the grip. The climber has pressed down on the right foot and it slipped out of the hold. Due to pressing down on the foot prematurely, we can see how the climber's center of gravity is being forced away from the wall. This will not help the climber to engage on a forceful, dynamic move to reach up to the hold. In this case, the climber might be able to just touch the hold without being able to engage any gripping power. The climber sustaining the grips will need to lower his center of gravity as far as he can, this applying pressure at the feet that are placed on the wall. A dyno is when the climber makes a dynamic move that uses momentum, which he is creating by swinging left to right or engaging into small pull-ups until he is ready to come out and uses that movement to go up to the next hold. He needs to make sure that he places exactly where his right hand that's going up will be aiming and the edge of the hold. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start. As we can see, each hold being a donut, the climber is able to wrap the fingers around the hold, at least in the bottom area of the holds. Now to create pressure on the fingers that are placed in the inside of the hold, the climber must lean down in order to create pressure with his body weight and to sustain the grip, he engages the thumbs that are placed on the outside of the holds to create more gripping power.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The violist obviously missed their entrance and the first violin waited for them very professionally Really nice change in dynamic structure here in the main violin while the viola took over briefly for that moment The spectacular octaves in the violin, very in tune and very intense, sounded great. Very obvious moment where there's an ostinato pattern happening in the viola while there's another type of pattern happening in the violin But I don't understand how they're connected They just sound like two separate musicians playing at the same time as opposed to a unified group The held out notes here in the viola I think are just a little stagnant, maybe even a little stale. You can see that they're keeping that bow pretty much right in the middle of their contact point, which gets a really strong solid sound, but they're trying to play underneath this higher melody and they could afford to move this bow closer to the fingerboard and have a little bit more control over the types of sounds that they're gonna create with this harmony section. The ensemble here fell apart just slightly, but they seem to have noticed and gotten back on track pretty well. A viola musician here tends to have a wrist that's a little too far up for my taste. You can see a lot of palm. You can see in comparison to the violinist here, the palm is a little bit more hidden. I would allow, I would tell the student to move this palm down and out so that the thumb could be less visible here as well. You would see just the tip of the thumb like you see here on the other musician. Notice how this musician here uses the bow at an up bow and actually decreases in dynamic here even though they're traveling to the frog. That implies that they're aware of the other musician and creating more phrasal structure. That's really pleasing to focus on. On simple struggles here for a sec. Trills tend to have a tough time being phrased. No difference here. They just kind of sounded like flutter notes that didn't really go anywhere in relation to the violin. I would advise practicing just the notes without the trill and see if you can follow the phrase with the first violin before adding the trills. Excellent group diminuendo and relaxing of energy here. energies in the two musicians are matched pretty well here. A good suggestion for this section would be to find the notes in the lower musician that matches or harmonizes well with the upper musician and emphasize those with him. Um, Ensemble feels a little weird here. Great start so far. Musicians look like they're seated properly, front of the chair, leaning forward, not in the back of the chairs. Both hands look like they're well set up as well. Violas here tends to have a little bit of a pop in that first finger when they're playing the third finger. This is indicative of extra weight or energy happening in a part of the finger or hand that's not needed. I would advise trying to keep this finger closer to the fingerboard to be ready at a moment's notice. Viola intonation here is wrong. There's some really nice phrasing going on with this musician here, but the accompanimental part here just seems to be staying pretty Steady and Monotone I would like to hear this musician match what's happening with the phrase with the other musician a little more here Really nice transfer from musician to musician here when they have that descending structure passing back and forth between each other Really nice ball hold in this musician. Solid fingers on this on the stick with a nice curve around the first finger part of the stick and then the pinky you can tell is right on top. Another really great curve of this finger on the other musician. However, you can tell that that thumb underneath this is buckled in and should be curved out instead. Really good conversation between these two musicians.

Also allow the balls to be closer towards the designated target, which is going to be the rim. As we look at the player's release on the right side of the frame, again, we will want the player to jump, giving the ball more lift and power it needs to get above the defense, and also to endure potential contact in the game-like scenario. The player does do a good job of getting the ball above his shoulders in the high release, and a great job of scoring his shoulders towards our designated target, which is the rim. The player does a good job as we look on the left side of the frame on his release having his follow through directed towards our targeted area which guides the ball to be able to hit our target which is going to be the top right corner of the box on the backboard allowing the ball to be able to hit the ball.

The player also does a solid job, as we look on the right frame again, of having his ball placement position leveled by his chest area. A slight improvement we can make is bringing the ball placement position even higher to create more ball control on the finish and also develop more ball security and protection. As we look on the left side of the frame on our player's release, we can notice that the player does really well at having his follow through rotated towards our targeted area, which allows and guides the ball towards our designated target. We will be able to drop through the net, resulting in a completed layup attempt. As we look on the right frame, as the player is going into his gather for his left-handed reverse layup attempt, again, we will want the player to bring his ball placement security higher towards his shoulder area to allow more ball security and to bring the ball closer towards our targeted area, creating a much easier finish. As we look on the right frame on our player's release, again, what will help the player be able to get a quicker release is to have the player jump with maximum effort, guiding his body's momentum towards the right side of the rim. As we look at the player go into his right-handed reverse layup attempt, again, the player does a good job at incorporating the proper footwork by jumping off his left leg, and also does a good job, as we can look on the left side of the frame, having his follow-through hand directing the ball towards our targeted area, which is going to be around the top right corner on the backboard, allowing the ball to create an easier angle of dropping inside the rim.

As we look on the release of the player's right-handed reverse layup, a slight improvement we will want to make is having the player jump with maximum effort, carrying his body's momentum towards the right side of the rim. This will help improve the player's quickness on his release and also help the player avoid being blocked and contested from opposing defenders in the game-light scenario. And as we look on the left side of the rim on our player's release, the player does a good job of having his follow-through hand rotated towards our target, allowing the ball to be directed with the right amount of touch, force, and rotation to be able to create a proper angle of going through the net.

You want it to be more of a flick up the wrist and powering up straight up, which is going in a circular motion. Right here we want to make sure we're not jumping off too far in the miking drill. This drill is designed to go off on foot. I think it's a pretty good location on the backboard, entering the white box, but just not elevating high enough nor doing the fundamentals of the drill correctly. Right here we want to make sure we're coming off our right leg, shooting ball with the left hand.

The ball hits outside the side of the square. It also has a good height. It's near the top of the square. But since it's outside of the square, we need good side spin on the ball in order for it to spin into the basket. And on this attempt, the player, he put good side spin on this one and it was able to spin off the backboard and into the basket. The player here shows the correct footwork by making sure that he jumps off of his left foot for the right hand reverse layup. As you can see here, he has his hand underneath the ball and his arm is extended out away from his frame. Again, the player shows good footwork by jumping off of the correct foot, the left foot, his left foot, which is the correct foot. You can't see his right knee because he's not lifting up his right knee. So the fact that he's not lifting up his right knee, that lets you know that he is not going full speed and he's not giving maximum effort on his jump in order to explode up high to the basket. So even though everything is technically correct, if we're not going full speed, we're not in a position to improve ourselves and improve our game. So it's really important that when we do the reverse layup and we're practicing that we really drive that right knee up to our waist level on the jump. That way it simulates a game-like situation. The player does a good job of placing the ball nicely at the top right corner of the box. Excuse me, the top right corner of the square on the backboard. So if we were to hit this spot and we will have little to no side spin it will go nice and easy into the basket. However, on this attempt the shooter, he put a lot of side spin on the ball so when it hit the backboard it's spent and we end up missing it long to the left side of the rim.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So that way everything is not square to the front, as well as moving up on her toes a little bit more as she crosses over. So overall, really nice job with this one. Everything was really smooth. I think the energy could have definitely went up a little bit just to elevate for the full performance, but overall, really nice job and good example. So here the dancer starts stepping in place with the basic choreography. She gets her feet slightly off the floor, keeping the energy nice and light. The knees are bent slightly, and as well as a really nice rotation in her arms and shoulders. So for her turns, really nice job on all four turns spotting, so keeping that head facing forward until she gets all the way around. She doesn't whip as hard, but it's a really clean, smooth whip around, and she's able to control her balance in her steps as she turns. And again, when she steps forward, try not to shift that whole foot on the floor, but push more on her toe. And then making sure both knees are bent as she's stepping forward and back, so keeping a nice groundedness to her floor, to the feet and the floor. So here when she steps out to the side, again, she keeps this light. Try to get that heel off the floor when she steps out, I would suggest. And also kind of pushing the hips out a little bit more. I think she can give a little bit more movement in her hips. But again, nice job keeping the knees nice and bent, and then good rotation in the arms.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So you just want to make sure, you either shift it over to the left if you're lefty, or shift it over to the right if you're righty, or just bring it up either side for a consistent jump shot of the tilt. Right here, look as if she's potentially shooting with two hands. Both follow throughs are going down with this thumb sticking up, which indicates it could be a very high possibility of her using two hands for the jump shot. And that's not how you typically shoot a jump shot. Right here, landing like this is definitely not recommended. It's almost like she's walking. So as you jump, you want to land on two, not on one or the other. The first thing that stands out is foot separation. Bounce feet too close together. Either for a jump shot or a free throw. Right here, this kind of confirms that the attempt is with two hands, whereas these two fingers are going to be bumping heads with these other two fingers, which you would call a lack of rotation. So it would be a very stiff ball, probably hard being that close and shooting with two hands, but you kind of want to figure that out and have a strong hand and an off hand. Right here, one foot is in front of the other, so we'll potentially come down off balance. You want to make sure you come down wherever you began or slightly, you know, forward. Right here, the ball is in a good position where it's not blocking her view, so that's a pretty good job there.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This arm that's stretched above head has a really clear shape as well as the one that's kind of crossing above his neck or lower face. He also very effectively crosses this left leg behind the right leg, though he could bend the knee and the right leg a bit more to stay more grounded. Overall he's got a nice clear shape here where he's able to move through it quickly and efficiently. As the dancer performs his turn around himself, he swipes his right arm through the air in front of him. However, he could really use a little bit more refinement here, which would help him move through the turn more quickly and efficiently. He would benefit from a more refined spot of the head, which would help him stay on balance and move through the turn quickly, as well as straightening this arm that's swiping out in front of him or slicing out in front of him, so that it's straighter and holds a bit more energy and power. He would also benefit from bending his knees and dropping his pelvis back, so he's a bit more grounded in this movement, which would help him move through the turn quickly while maintaining on rhythm and tempo. As the dancer begins with kind of a basic walking pattern moving to the side He is engaging his full body in the movement. However, he's doing so in a way That's really disconnecting him from the rhythm of the music and is lacking a lot of clarity His arms are moving a lot, which is welcome. However, they're kind of lacking choreographic clarity and refinement here He's also got a lot of extraneous movement happening in his shoulders his torso and a little bit into his pelvis Which is throwing him off the rhythm and again needs a bit more refinement and he needs to focus on Staying connected to the rhythm as well through the use of the feet As the dancer performs this body roll, he has a lot of nice range of motion in his pelvis and a nice deep bend in his knees. However, his arms don't have a lot of clarity choreographically, and he really doesn't engage his upper body, his shoulders, and his head in the way that he needs to to more effectively perform this step. Particularly the head stays really disengaged with this movement, and he doesn't effectively roll through the pelvis up through all parts of the spine, the neck, and to the head. As the dancer performs a box step around himself while maintaining a shimmy in his shoulders, he keeps some real nice clear shapes in his arms choreographically, and is able to connect to the rhythm and embody the rhythm, particularly through the refined use of the shimmying of the shoulders, as well as maintains a nice steady tempo with his feet, which shows that he is able to embody polyrhythm, which is a little bit more advanced here.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So there's a non-kicking foot making contact with the ball while in front. So as we're making that impact with the ball we're already on a kind of forward follow through action with the ball. You can see the contact with the ball is very low so that's going to impact the trajectory of the ball. Within the low half of the ball is going to make the ball want to naturally travel on an upwards trajectory. And it's also, you can see the body is already starting to lean a little bit back but is not really utilising his upper body for any additional balance, control, power or momentum through the strike. Again, limited approach for the player, more of static ball, one step, so coming very square behind the line. We'll say here that the foot is in a much better position, heel, sorry, toe level with the front of the ball, good distance between the ball and the non-kicking foot, which is going to help in terms of the player getting his body moving through the line of the shot, also improves our ability to get this back lift through the line of the ball. You can see the striking leg, the right leg, has come from a very straight position, very far back, so we're not utilising our body to help with our balance to get our back lift up and really generate additional power, control and outcome in the shot. Again, just looking at impact, so the player, because of the non-kicking foot, it's going to impact what the player is able to do with the right foot. You can see again the toe is really pointing down to the ground on contact, so we're going to be impacting the part of the ball we want to make contact with. For the maximum control, we want to try and hit through the middle of the ball, the inside curvature of the foot. You see again, because the player is reaching forward to make contact with the ball, the body is leaning back behind the line of the ball, so as we're leaning back, that takes our head behind the line of the ball, that's going to naturally, alongside the part of the ball we want to make contact with, get the ball travelling on an upwards trajectory, so we lose elements of control and power through the strike. Again, player very limited in his approach. He's approaching the ball at a slight angle. Again, we can see the non-kicking foot well behind the line of the ball in terms of the front of the ball. And again, this is dictated a little bit by the position of the non-kicking foot pointing well outside the line of the goal. So now our follow-through action and our contact is gonna really be based on the angle of the foot and the part of the ball we're gonna make contact with and the follow-through action, which is controlled a little bit by that non-kicking foot is gonna have its impact also. So I wanna make sure we get our non-kicking foot alongside the ball, toe level with the front of the ball so we can get our follow-through action coming through the line of the shot. And you can see, so player keeps his foot in a locked position, straight leg on that follow through, following through in that direction. So that's helping control both on the contact with the ball and that immediate follow through action is helping direct the ball. But again, the body is not really being utilized for any element of the shot, more just the follow through action, the right leg and the contact with the ball. Again, the follow-through action, so you can see again the player keeps his foot in a locked position, looks like a straight leg coming through the ball in the general direction the ball is going. Again, you can see the leg curling slightly away to the left, but the body is more being utilised this time you can see for the position of the arms, maintaining balance, getting his body moving forward, more in line with that standing foot so we can generate more elements of power by utilising our body in that way. Here again the player maybe a little bit more of a preparation here, kind of a little jump, not very far, a couple of inches, but he is approaching the ball from a slight angle which is going to help in just terms of opening up his body to rotate through the ball. Again we can see the non-kicking foot is not in a great position, we want that non-kicking foot to be alongside the ball, toes level with that front of the ball so we create this number 10 shape between the non-kicking foot and where the position of the ball is. The distance between the foot and the ball is going to really affect the player's ability to make contact with the ball. Again you can see from the upright position of the player, he's not really utilising his upper body to open up his body, open his hips, back lift is very shallow, so although that doesn't necessarily guarantee power, the power comes from the technical action of contact with the ball, follow through with the back lift can help really generate that momentum through the ball and get the balance of the body moving through the ball. I do like that the player maintains visual contact on the ball throughout the strike, so regardless of the approach, the player is really focused on a specific part of the ball, hopefully that can help him control the direction of the pass. very little preparation for the player non-kicking foot again in a position that doesn't necessarily help the player with his technical actions, toe well behind the line of the ball we want the foot alongside the ball the toe level with the front of the ball if not slightly in front and we want a three-quarters to full balls width between the foot and the ball to allow for good range of motion through the line of the ball with the right foot again we'd like to see the player stepping and approaching the ball from an angle so we can really generate additional momentum control and power by utilizing the whole of the body here the player because of the way they step into the ball you see the body is very upright we're really reliant on everything coming from the leg that's striking the ball Again, just looking at the contact with the ball so we can see the non-kicking foot pointing towards the right, the left foot toe pointing down and really hitting more closer to the ankle heel part of the foot with the ball which is a harder surface, an outer rounded surface so that's going to impact the direction of the ball. We don't necessarily have full control over where that ball is going, we want to hit through the inside curvature of the foot through the middle of the ball to maximise the surface area that we make contact with to maximise the control that we have. Obviously we're also reaching forwards in front of our body so we're making contact as we're on that upwards follow through motion so the amount of power and control we generate through that follow through motion is going to be limited and we can also see that we're not really utilising our upper body, our arms are really down by our side so we're not maintaining additional balance or momentum by opening up our hips and rotating our body through the ball. Again here, player doesn't approach the ball, doesn't step into the ball, more stops the ball and comes from a static position. So again, we can see the non-kicking foot not in a great position. We want that non-kicking foot beside the ball, create the number 10 shape, get the toe level with the front of the ball, three quarter to a full ball's width between the ball and the non-kicking foot to give ourselves options and momentum. And with the foot so close to the ball, is going to restrict what we can do with the right leg. So we always want to encourage players to approach the ball from a side angle, step into that ball to really open up their body, be able to generate some power and control. Looking at the contact with the ball and the foot so we can see again the player because of the non-kicking foot well behind the line of the ball when they're reaching in front the foot is obviously angling to redirect the direction of the ball and see the toe is pointing downwards so we're going to be hitting the lower half of the ball so it's going to affect both the trajectory the quality of the strike and we're also making contact with the ball on our way up so it's not a problem we're striking the ball with a straighter leg that's actually going to help with the power and control but we're going to try and hit the ball as our leg is vertically straight and down from the lower leg to really maximize the action of the follow-through in the backswing again because the ball is in front of the standing leg makes it difficult for the players body momentum to be moving forward so we want to try and get our body leaning slightly forward through the strike get our head over the ball get our body moving forwards in the line that the ball is traveling We can look on the contact with the ball again the heel is up, toe is down that's going to impact the part of the ball that we make contact with so we want the toe to be pointing slightly up to lock our ankle. Again part of the issue here is how close the ball is to the non kicking foot so we really don't want the lower leg pointing inwards towards that non kicking foot because that's naturally going to get the foot in that position even if the ankle is locked, toes still going to be pointing down it's going to impact the contact point with the ball so the distance between the non kicking foot and the ball is important so we get the lower part of the leg going directly down from the knee not coming inside because now obviously we're angling our foot towards the ball and our foot's in a position it's not going to help us with the genuine contact. Again body position very upright very tall so there's no element of follow through and movement through the line of the ball to help control the power and accuracy of the shot. Player looking to strike with the left foot, again no real approach or preparation for the ball, kind of just a little stutter step to get the right foot in position as he prepares to strike with the left. See the non-kicking foot pointing well outside the line of the goal and this is going to affect our balance, our control, our final position, our hip placement, body position in the follow-through. We can also see obviously it's not in a position alongside the ball, Colm's obviously also in a position in the way so we haven't prepared the ball correctly, get our toe alongside the front of the ball, create that number 10 shape between the non-kicking foot and the ball and get the distance right so now we're going to be reaching in front of our body to make contact, it's going to affect all elements of our balance and control through the strike. Again, no real approach for the player, just kind of turning and stepping alongside the ball without actually stepping in. So there's no angle of approach per se, just more putting the left foot in a position. So you see that the toe is in line with the front of the ball, but there's a way too big of a gap between the non-kicking foot and the ball. And especially with no run up or approach to really get. You see there's no back lift, the player's leg is just coming from a very static position, straight position coming through the ball. The upper body is not being utilised at all, the arms aren't anywhere other than by his side, back up straight. So the player is really going to be relying on just the contact between the foot and the ball. Again, just looking at the contact point with the ball, so the player's heel pointing up, toe down. Based on the position between the ball and the non-kicking foot, it's going to change the angle of contact. So you can see because of the ball, the foot is coming through and the ball is in front of the non-kicking foot, so the foot is now angled on the side. So now we're hitting the right side of the back of the ball, which is going to control the angle and direction of the ball, not necessarily controlled by the help of the body position. So we want our non-kicking foot to be pointing in the direction we want the ball to go, our hips and our chest to be pointing in the direction we want to go, so we can really maximise the follow-through and contact with the ball. And you see the follow through action. So based on the contact point between the ball, the angle of the foot, that generally is controlling the outcome. You see the follow through here, the foot changes its position from being pointing out, heel locked, toe down, to very quickly turning and coming across his body. So the follow through action is not helping in terms of controlling the intended outcome and direction of the shot. We can see there's a slight follow through action, which brings the body slightly further forward, but the control actually shows more determined by the angle of the foot and the contact point on the ball. And just looking at the contact, we can see again the toe is pointing down towards the ground on contact and we're also making contact with the ball on the follow through again because the non-kicking foot is behind the line of the ball. As we're stepping and approaching to the ball it's going to affect the timing and the contact point between the right foot and the ball. And again the body's not being utilised so any power or control is really being generated from the right foot and the right leg. The body's not being utilised in the motion. Again, making contact with the ball inside of the right foot, toe pointing down, which is going to affect the exact point of the ball when the toe is pointing down and not slightly up. We're not going to be hitting genuinely through the middle of the ball. It's always going to be the lower half of the ball. So we lose elements of control and power. You can see again, the angle of the foot is going to really control because there's no angle of approach. There's no body momentum moving through. So it's all going to be based on this contact point. So hitting the ball, right side of the ball, angled foot is going to veer the ball back towards the left through the center. So the body position really doesn't affect the control of the shot. You can see the body is upright. Arms are really just down by his side, not really being utilized for any momentum control or balance. And so no real power in this shot or control over the actual point of contact with the ball. So you see the player in a very upright body position. No follow through, just landing on the left foot that makes contact with the ball. Kind of just half, half kind of steps through the line of the shot. Here you see the player in his follow-through action steps through the line of the ball. Again because he's hitting the ball in front of his standing leg, this foot has to quickly come down to the ground just to re-establish the balance. You can see the player's body momentum is still moving forward through the line of the shot which is good. But it's more just with his feet than his body. You can see his body is leaning back. So ideally as our feet are moving forward, we'll be moving our body forward, keeping our hips and our chest aligned with the trajectory and the direction that we want the pass to go. We can see on the follow through, just because of the position of the non-kicking foot and the balance of the body, not really utilising the upper body throughout the approach and preparation, the initial follow through is there in the line of the ball but then quickly has to tail away to the left for balance and control of his body. But you can see obviously the ball is travelling forward but the body is still leaning back and away and then the follow through action is going to be disconnected from the strike itself so we lose elements of control and power so we're really reliant now on the exact contact point between the foot and the ball to direct the outcome of where the ball is going to travel to. Looking at the point of contact again, so we can see because of how close the non-kicking foot is to the ball, you can see it's very difficult for the player to really open up his hips and utilise the surface of the foot the player is choosing. So that lower leg is bending in, that's going to naturally, regardless of whether he locks his ankle, lead to the toe pointing down. So that's going to make an impact on the part of the ball that we strike as we go through the ball, so the toe is pointing down, we're going to naturally hit a lower part of the ball and maybe more with the heel than the inside of the foot. So that non-kicking foot really impacts a lot of the different action and obviously we're also behind the line of the ball so now as we make contact the lower leg is already on its way up, which is going to again impact the quality of the strike. We can see again the body not really being utilised, it's actually leaning back because we're reaching slightly forward for the ball, not utilising our arms and our body to generate additional momentum, control and power. Looking again on contact with the ball, we can see the player utilising the inside of the foot, but really reaching out with an extended leg with the position of the ball with a non-kicking foot. So the quality of the contact is going to be limited as we're reaching out for the ball and the ball is obviously well in front of the line of the body. So any power that we are generating is going to be limited because there's going to be a limited follow-through so the player is going to have to reach forward and through the line of the shot. Again, no real approach for the player. I mean, again, see where the standing foot goes, really far behind the line of the ball. So we want this non-kicking foot to be alongside the ball, create this number 10 shape, toe level with the front of the ball as much as we can. So as we're stepping into the ball, that allows us to get our body in a better position and our body momentum to move through to generate additional control and power. So looking at the contact point of the ball, so again we can see toe still pointing slightly down to the ground, so utilising the inside of the foot. You can see the angle of the foot is still really pointing forward, so we're hitting the side of the ball or hitting the ball closer to the heel, as opposed to really punching through the middle of the ball with the inside of the foot for the maximum control and power. So we're really reliant here on the contact point between the ball and the foot as to the direction and the power and control that we generate. Again you can see the body very upright, no body momentum moving through the strike, so really just reliant on the right leg and the right foot striking through the ball. Just looking at the contact, again the non-kicking foot really dictates elements throughout the action we can see now. The player is reaching out from his body, toe is pointing downwards towards the ground, we're making contact closer to the heel, the inside of the foot obviously is angled away to the left as well so with the toe position down, hitting the ball close to the heel and the side of the ball we're really lacking some elements of control and power through the strike and again we can see on contact with the ball we're reaching out in front of our body on the follow through upwards action so there's limited power and control that we generate through the strike. and we see here the player controlling elements of the power of the shot through keeping his foot in his locked position and following through the line of the ball and we can see again that follow through is a little bit limited ideally if we're in a good position we can get through to a 90 degree angle to follow through here you can see the initial follow through with that straight leg is in the direction the ball goes but then tail is away to the left so it's going to impact the quality of the strike and we can also again see the body position player is fighting to get his body moving forward by bending this left knee forward but his body is still leaning back and away so he's very much reliant on his right leg right foot to make contact and follow through the direction of the shot Just looking at contact again, player is very consistent where he has his toe pointing down towards the ground so we're not necessarily making genuine contact through the middle of the foot and you can see a lot of the lower half of the ball is showing so we're hitting closer to the heel and that's going to affect the quality and the part of the ball that we're making contact with. Because the foot is slightly behind the line of the ball we end up reaching forward for it and we also end up with our lower leg turning inside which in turn obviously controls the direction that the toe is pointing, it's harder to point that toe slightly up and come through the ball. We can also see the body position, player not really utilising his upper body for additional range, balance and momentum through the ball so now the body is leaning back and away from the intended direction that we want the ball to go. Again, limited preparation for the player here is more of a one-step approach. Again, coming very square behind the ball. I always recommend players come at the ball from a slight angle so we can step in, utilise our body to rotate through the ball. Non-kicking foot, we want to be alongside the ball where the toe is level or slightly in front of the front of the ball. That allows us to really step into the pass, stroke, shot, get our body momentum through the ball. So you can see here the foot is behind the line of the ball so it ends up we're going to be reaching slightly in front of the body as we make contact. Distance between the ball and the non-kicking foot, we recommend three quarters to a full ball's width. So here, distance is okay in terms of the horizontal but we want the foot to be moving much further forward to help with the player's balance and control. You can also see the player not really utilising his upper body and his body well behind the line of the ball which is going to impact the player's balance as he strikes through the line of the shot. Again, limited approach from the player. He does step towards the ball here, relatively square behind the ball based on where his non-kicking foot is planted and pointing. So we can see the toe pointing towards the right side of the goal as we look at it. So based on that, player is coming very square to the ball. Again, we want the non-kicking foot alongside the ball. So based on where the toe is pointing, we'd probably expect the foot to be further forward, toe level with the front of the ball. Distance between the foot and the ball is okay. That allows us more room to bring this right leg back and through. And by stepping towards the ball, you can see allows for a slightly greater back lift and more use of the body to strike through the line of the shot. Again, player not really preparing the ball or approaching the ball to help him with the technical actions. We can see it's a kind of a small, kind of few inches step to the left to prepare. We see again the position of the non-kicking foot in terms of the toe is really back from the ball. We can see the direction of the non-kicking foot is pointing well outside the line of the goal. So that's going to impact the player's action, his follow through, his contact with the ball. So we want to get this foot alongside the ball, create this number 10 shape between the non-kicking foot and the ball itself. That's going to help in the following actions. We can see there's a slight back lift for the player preparing to strike through, but the player is utilizing none of his upper body to open up his body, open up his hips to strike through the line of the shot. see here the players follow through generates more of the power and control so the straight leg keeps his foot locked in this position so that's better from the player but again very limited in terms of the approach to the ball so he's really focused on using that inside of the foot with the right foot and the the motion of the leg through the ball to get the control and power that the player is generating not really much generated from the body throughout the motion of the approach and the strike The player utilising his left foot, so here the ball is rolling a little bit, doesn't actually move his left foot in preparation to striking the ball. So it's always important in preparation for a strike that we're stepping into the shot from a side angle to really provide us with the opportunity to get our back lift and our follow through action coming through the ball. So, player here not really approaching the ball or stepping to the ball. You see his body is very upright. So there's no preparation in terms of the strike. On contact with the ball again, you can see the angle of the foot is going to make contact. So regardless of the non-kicking foot, because it's not really been placed to prepare for the shot, the direction of this ball is really going to be controlled by the angle of the foot, the part of the ball we're making contact with, and then a little bit of the follow through action. Player utilising the inside of the foot, we can see on contact the player again because of the non-kicking foot is planted behind the line of the ball, just naturally the player if he's using the inside of his foot is going to be now already extending his leg on the upwards follow through action with the ball. So it's going to limit the power that we can generate. We can also see the foot is making contact again with the lower half of the ball which is going to affect the trajectory of the ball coming off the ground and up. So again depending on the player's intention that could be purposeful or not. And then you see the body again very upright, not really utilising, you see from his arms there's no body momentum moving through the ball so all the power and control is really coming from the contact point with the foot and the ball and the general momentum of the striking leg. Again, player very limited in his approach, non-kicking foot, planting well behind the line of the ball. We want that non-kicking foot alongside the ball to create that number 10 shape, toe level with the front of the ball, slightly in front. Distance is not too bad, but again, really behind the line of the ball, which is gonna lead to the right foot now having to extend in front of the body, reaching for the ball, which is gonna affect the outcome of the quality of the strike. You can also see the toe pointing towards the outer part of the goal. So in terms of the position of the ball, the position of the non-kicking foot is gonna impact the complete action and the follow-through motion with the hips and the body. Again, player kind of slow approach to the ball, no real preparation. Just take a slight step with the left foot, but we can see again the non-kicking foot well behind the line of the ball. So we want that toe to be level with the front of the ball, create this number 10 shape between the non-kicking foot and the ball, and really step alongside the ball to be able to generate maximum amount of control, power, get our body moving in unison with the strike. So here, obviously with the non-kicking foot being so far behind the ball and away, it's going to affect the quality of the strike and contact with the ball. You know the players contact with the ball, again toe looks like it's pointing down so it's going to impact the contact with the ball if our toes pointing down. It's always naturally going to hit more of the underside of the ball which is going to mean the ball is going to naturally raise up. We can see the player is now making contact with the ball more with a straight leg down from the knee and we're not bending our lower leg inside. Because of where the position of the non-kicking foot is really helps us in terms of the contact point with the ball and the technique so we can get our body more in line with the ball although the player is still slightly leaning back. We want to try and get our chest leaning slightly forward, head over the ball so we can really maximise our body momentum moving through the strike. One thing I say for the player is he consistently is looking at the ball through the technical actions that's going to help him in terms of his contact point with the ball and really giving himself the best possible chance for success. ac yn gyflawni'r gweithgaredd ar gyfer y gweithgaredd, fel y gwelwch chi, mae'r chwaraewr yn gweithio yn seiliedig yn y lle gyda'i phwyto, y lle ar y strwyth, drwy'r rhan o'r sioe.

Players not really approaching the ball and just kind of half stepping into a position to try and strike the ball. So you can see a non-kicking foot pointing really wide to the right of the goal, well behind the line of the ball. So we want our non-kicking foot to be positioned alongside the ball with our toe level with the front of the ball and stepping into the shot to allow for the back through and the follow-through action and to strike through the line of the shot. So you can see the player is going to be well behind the line of ball as he's attempting to shoot the ball. Again, the follow-through action, we can see the player is maintaining a relatively locked position with his foot, but there's a limited follow-through coming across his body slightly, so we're not really in full sync between the motion of the technique and the direction and accuracy of the pass. So the player's body is facing the direction he wants the ball to go, the non-kicking foot is pointing that way, the follow-through is coming across his body, so the player in terms of using his body momentum and balancing him through the shot is limited and more related to the contact point between the ball and the right foot striking the ball. Again, there's no real preparation for the ball. Player kind of hops over to his left to get his foot in a position prior to striking the ball with the right. We can see the non-kicking foot again well behind the line of the ball. Toe is not really helping control the direction of the body or the ball. The distance between the ball and the foot is really close. So that's going to limit the player's ability to choose the correct surface or get any form of momentum striking through the ball. We can see there's a slight back lift with the player as he prepares for the ball. But depending on the surface selection of the foot he's looking to use, it's going to be limited based on the position of the ball with a non-kicking foot. Once again, we can see the upper body is not really being utilised for any element of control or power. So we're not opening up our hips, opening up our body to get this back lift higher and to strike through the ball with a follow through. Point of contact, again, we can see a result of the feet being very close together and the ball being in front of the non-kicking foot. It's going to impact the striking leg. You can see the toe position pointing down. Lower leg is turning inside, so that's going to impact what part of the ball we can genuinely make contact with. So it's going to be the lower half of the ball, maybe towards the right of the ball or hitting the ball closer to the heel. We're also seeing that the player, because the ball is in front of the standing foot, the contact with the ball is going to be as the striking leg is on its way up and through. So we lose elements of the follow through in terms of control and power. We also have our body now leaning back, which is going to lead to the ball either going further up because we're reaching for the ball, and we lose that element of body momentum moving through the strike. player striking the ball with the right foot so there is a slight preparation step here so taking a half step towards the ball still quite square behind the ball want to try and come at the ball at an angle want the non-kicking foot to be alongside the ball with the toe level with the front of the ball 3 quarters to a full balls width between the non-kicking foot and the ball so the non-kicking foot here is in a better position than some of the prior actions but again the player is not really stepping into the pass stroke shot to generate any real momentum with his body control, you can see his body is very upright there is no motion to step into the strike to follow through the shot Yn y ddifrif yma, mae'r chwaraewr yn gadael mewn leoedd gwych gyda'i ffyrdd. Mae'n dilyn ymlaen gyda chweithredaeth cyflawniol yn y dyfodol y bydd y ball eisiau mynd. Ond eto, oherwydd y bydd y ball yn ymwneud \u00e2'r ddifrif ychydig, nid yw'r chwaraewr yn defnyddio'r ymdrechion arall neu'r pwerau, yn sefydliad cyflym ac yn ymddangos yn fawr ar ei leoedd gwael a chysylltu ag y ball i gynhwys y pwerau a'r cyd-destun. see a very little follow through the positive is as the player steps into the strike with the left foot or the pass with the left foot he does land on his left foot which gets the body moving forward in the line of the shot although we obviously want that follow through to help generate additional power as well as control so now the control of the ball is really just focused on the contact point between the ball the angle of the foot and the part of the ball we're making contact with rather than utilizing the body so we can obviously see here the hips the chest pointing to the left non-kicking foot is moving forward pointing forwards the striking leg is still angled out to the left as he lands so the the unison of the action is not consistent And looking at contact again, so again, toe pointing down towards the ground. We want the toe more to be pointing up so we can strike more through the middle of the ball. The toe pointing down is naturally gonna make contact with the lower half of the ball or generate more contact with the heel, which is gonna be a different surface of the foot. So it's gonna really impact our quality of strike. Again, we can see on contact, the player obviously is reaching in front because of where the non-kicking foot was planted. So we're already on a kind of upwards follow-through motion as we strike the ball, which now leads to the player's body naturally leaning further back where we want our chest and our head to be in a more forwards leaning position so we can get our full body momentum moving through the ball. Now looking at the contact point with the ball, again the non-kicking foot has a huge impact on the other actions. So we can see the heel up, toe down, that's going to mean we're hitting the ball in a different place to where we'd like the ball, maybe through the middle of the ball to generate the maximum control and power. You can see the angle of the foot is hitting the right side of the ball, which is going to affect the direction of the shot and we can see because again we step behind the line of the ball, player is now reaching so he's actually making contact with the ball on part of the follow through action and his body is leaning back and away from where he wants to go, which is forwards, so we're going to have elements of control and power missing because our body is not going to be moving through the line of the shot. Player switching to his left foot which looks like his weaker foot. So again, very no real genuine approach to the ball, just kind of a half step with the right foot. And again, we can see where the non-kicking foot is in relation to the ball. We want this non-kicking foot to be alongside the ball, toe level with the front of the ball, create this number 10 shape between the non-kicking foot and where the position of the ball is. This allows us now to step into the shot, into the pass, get our body and our strike moving in relation to the ball. Here we're going to end up reaching forwards in front of our body which is going to affect the quality and control of the shot. So again, player, there's no real approach to the ball. So it's a static ball and kind of a, an inch or two to shuffle towards the ball. So we want the foot, the non-kicking foot to be alongside the ball, toe level with the front of the ball, you can see the foot is well far back behind the line of the ball, which is going to affect the player's backswing, follow through, contact point with the ball, and the general control and accuracy of the shot. Once again, there's no real approach for the player, just kind of from a standing position. So you can see on contact, the position of the non-kicking foot well behind the line of the ball. The distance between the non-kicking foot and the ball is extended, so that's gonna affect the follow-through action. So we want the non-kicking foot to step into the pass stroke shot, get our toe level with the front of the ball, create this number 10 shape between the non-kicking foot and the ball. So then that helps us with the other parts of the action for the pass stroke shot. A very short approach again for the player, just kind of a half step, coming very square. I always encourage players when striking the ball to try and come at the ball on an angle which will open up the hips, open up the options for the player. You see the non-kicking foot again, we want it to be placed alongside the ball, toe level with the front of the ball as much as we can. The distance here from the ball is okay, but again, far behind the ball, so we're going to end up reaching for it. We want that toe to be pointing in the general direction we want the ball to go. It just helps with our body momentum coming through the ball, the hip placement, body placement and the follow-through action resulting in the end. We can also see the player, because he's not approaching the ball or stepping into the ball, can't really utilise his upper body for additional balance, momentum and ability to open up his chest, his hips and bring the right leg back with a genuine back lift to come and strike through the line of the shot. On the point of contact you can see heel is up, toe is down so that's going to affect the contact point with the ball and we can also see the player obviously reaching in front of the line of the body so the non-kicking foot well behind the line of ball so now we're making contact with the ball as we are on an upwards angle with the right leg and it's also affecting between the distance the ability for the player to really open up his hips and get his knee out and then this toe in an upwards position to strike through the line of ball we can also see because of the non-kicking foot behind the line of the ball and the player reaching this now leads to the body leaning back and away from the intended direction of the shot You see here the player keeps his foot in a relatively locked position, comes immediately through the line of the ball which is where the control and the power of this particular pass comes from. But again we can see the body leaning back and away in the opposite direction to the direction the ball is going to go. We want to make sure that we're utilising our body as much as we can, stepping forward and being at least in line with the standing foot, if not moving forward so we can land on that right foot and keep moving in the direction the ball is going.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The climber is trying to do this hand foot match. It's definitely a hard method because of the nature of this hold. It kind of comes up like this and then flattens out at the top and there isn't a ton of room actually to hand heel. Ideally the climber would be able to bump their right hand down but this is gonna put a lot more force in this left hand so the hand heel is a bit of a dead end. So the climber decides to go up right hand to this pinch. You can see them on it here in this right frame. They're trying to kind of gun for it, which you really do need to do this move delicately. I think switching the feet here would help control this twist out that the climber is going to experience when grabbing this hold. I also think a little bit more thumb action underneath the hold, pinch it like a brick, similar to this left hand would be ideal as well.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And the climber is in this position. This is sort of a one, two footwork, or a foot jump. It's a jump, but the feet are very integral. So first they're gonna drive through this left foot and get the hips to say about here. And in a perfect world, they would then transfer that weight from the right foot and push really hard through there and get the hips to about here. It's pretty common in climbing where you wanna utilize one foot to generate power and then mid move, transfer that weight to the other. You can get really, really high on the wall this way. And so here you can see the climber has left the right hand and the left hand is still in I think the best way to go about this boulder would just to be to leave both hands at the same time Also staying over the right foot for a little bit longer in order to get more power out of it would be good as well and Climbers really wanting to go one hand into this jug here", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He's moved his tomatoes into a bowl. Again, he's added all of the spice mixture to the bowl, which I would assert is going to be extremely strong and for most people probably not palatable. And it appears he's doing another rough chop or rustic cut on this, where there's no uniform size or shape. It's just cuts. He's moving his cut cucumber to a plate. He's removed that end piece. Probably won't use that in the salad. It's got a piece that's gonna attach back to the plant and obviously be a little tough and not flavorful. So that's something you wanna discard. He's cutting his cucumber into rounds using his cutting device. If you look right here while he's stirring, there's going to be a shimmer. That shimmer is the excess oil that he has added to that mixture. That just gives you an indication that it's too much. Anytime you add a liquid to something like this cucumber salad, it's not a delicate blend of flavors, but it is one that needs to be balanced. And having a pool of liquid in the base usually indicates that you've probably gone a little too far with the volume. Now he's moving his tomato to the cutting device and board. He's having trouble with his cutting device because it is constructed so that it is off of the cutting board here and makes full contact here at the handle. He would want to do the majority of his cutting closer to the point of full contact as you would with a knife. Anything that is not able to contact all the way through the cucumber and onto the cutting board is not going to make a full cut. So you can see he will struggle with this a little. He's using a spoon to mix the blend, getting all of the... Now he has what looks to be a masala or a spice mixture. It's probably a blend of spices that is familiar to him or his family. That would be something like cumin, coriander, maybe some ginger, maybe pepper, potentially salt. Not always, but something that is a comforting blend of spices familiar. He's adding all of the oil in his bowl to the tomato cucumber mixture. This is probably a little too much oil. If this were also a vinegar, it would probably be a little too much as well. Either way, he is adding something that will add a little bit of texture and another layer of flavor. If it is oil, it's gonna give a nice smooth mouth feel and it plays well against the crunch and the coolness of the two vegetables. And that's mostly because these two vegetables are, they absorb flavor and that's one of the beauties of a cucumber tomato salad is that they are going to absorb the flavors added to them. And so if you add something that is pooling, then that you've added more than they can take in. And that's probably just not gonna help. He's made a rough chop, we could call that rustic. It's large pieces, not of any particular uniform size or shape. Now he's adding the cucumber to the bowl. He has a device that is a combination of a cutting board with a cutting device that's inside of the board or attached to the board. It's not something you see very usually, but it is a very interesting device that allows him to cut on that surface without using a separate knife. He's gotten a bowl. Here again, he's having to slide his tomato forward to the end that makes greater contact to be able to make the cut fully through. . Now he's cutting into his rounds He's drizzling what appears to be an oil on his tomato and cucumber mixture. He's got his fingers kind of protruding out here, which is a little dangerous, but because he's using the cucumber as a barrel shape and not finding a flat surface, that might be necessary to keep it fully planted on the cutting board.

It's going to come up and over it. And as it does, it causes his foot to reposition and just completely cut down and away, causing him to cut free. So in the future, probably just, you know, you want to see just how you would grab the handhold and think about how you're going to move off of them, how you place the feet and the sequence and how long you can use the foot is going to be dependent on the angle. And if it's going to mess you up later by slipping off and not, you know, it's going to affect how, what, what movement you can do, what position you can be in. So he kind of pulls on and steps his left foot on. It looks like his right foot is placed nicely. But then when he kind of goes to put his left foot back up high on this hold, it doesn't really appear that he looks at where he's placing it. So when he places it, it looks like he may have placed it a little bit wrong or not in line with how he's going to move up the wall. And you can see it just slips completely away. He is, I would say, I'll give him props because he is loading it up quite nicely. And so there is a lot of tension there. It's just in the wrong spot. As we see, he's staring straight up as he places his left foot back on the wall. It looks like he kind of places it not where it needs to be.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So, here he has stirred the milk a couple of different times. There's a few reasons why that is a good practice. One, you're making sure that the milk solids do not burn on the bottom and that the heat is evenly distributing through the milk so you don't have burnt milk. So what I see first off in this video that this cook has probably made this dish before. I do love his organization because he's just reaching back knowing where everything is and that definitely speeds up the process of making a dish. We call it mise en place, knowing where all your ingredients or putting all your ingredients in their proper position. As you can see here, he is pouring the milk in a slow steady stream as to not make a mess and he has that strainer to remove any tea solids out of the milk tea so you're not swallowing that and drinking that and ruining your tea. He also watched the flame. This is also why I can tell that this cook has some experience doing this, is because he was also watching the flame and turning the flame down so that the milk does not boil over. That is a very good thing that the cook just did right there. Instead of setting the spoon on the counter, which could be full of contaminants, he used the same milk container that he poured the milk into the pot with to keep the spoon from off the counter.

They're not using a lot of bow, and they're also playing at the tip. So if they could try to use more bow, just to make sure that they can hear the notes evenly, and then they can adjust the intonation from there. The clarity in this chord could be much improved. If they were to take away their elbow away from their side, they were able to get more of their curved fingers into the string. Additionally, they should be using more bow to make sure that they can get a clearer sound. Again, the bow speaker is very slow and not helping them able to hear the pitch. They should try to keep the bow faster and more steady so that they're creating a better sound and overall they can hear their pitch better. The pulosas are being really tentative with their bow usage, I think because of the intonation is tricky with the chords. No matter what they're doing, they should try to make sure that they're always using a healthy amount of bow so that they're getting the best sound possible. If you will, just make some mistake. It'd be good for them just to practice their skills more consistently so that they don't make any mistakes. The violist has a tendency to keep their fingers high off the fingerboard. They should try to keep them as close as possible, and if playing a higher finger, any of the lower fingers should stay on the string. Again, this is an example where they're using a small amount of bow. Their sound isn't projecting as much as it could. If they were to use just a little bit more extra speed, they'd get a better sound and could hear their pitch even better. This double stop could be more balanced. You could play the lower string a little bit more and also use more bow. Since they're playing two strings, there's more friction, so they need a little bit more to make sure that they're speaking clearly. The BUS plays a chord, where they're playing two strings at once. When playing out at the tip of the bow, their sound is really thin. They can try to pronate more in their right hand to make sure that their weight is able to get through the bow to the tip of the bow. The vios is playing a scale. This is another example where the sound sounds very thin, so when trying to hear and analyze the chord, it's not as clear. If they used more bow and a little bit more weight distributed evenly between the chord of the two strings, that would help a lot. Intonation can be improved on this chord if they're able to bring their hand a little bit further around. You can see in this finger here that it's collapsed because they're trying to make the hand shape. If they can bring their elbow a little bit more away from their body, they can get further around the fingerboard to have a more curved hand shape. Then here's an example of their fingers coming really high off the fingerboard. The more that they're playing, I believe this is why they're making any mistakes, they can be more efficient by keeping them closer to the fingerboard. Again, this is another example that as they're getting higher up the string, they should move their bow closer to the bridge so that they still get a very clear sound and then they can hear the pitch better. The sound isn't as clear as before. The vules can bring their bow closer to the bridge to make sure that they still get very good sound and that they can hear the pitch better.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Again, it would be helpful for them to consider an approach where they play more with the tip of their finger and then they can get a little bit more coordination with their hands. In this piece, the pianist could get a little bit more brightness and brilliance in their sound if they used more of their fingertips and more speed into the key and then quickly out of it. The pianist is starting to rush here just really slightly. Some of the notes start to feel a bit compressed with their rhythms. It'd be best for them just to make sure that they can practice this with a metronome and also practice slower so they really feel like their hands are even when they're playing. Pianist uses their forearm to help guide them to find this note down the keyboard. The pianist is playing with flat fingers, and if they could play with more curved fingers, they would have more ease of playing the notes and ease of getting around the keyboard. The pianist is doing a good job of transferring their weight from this note to this note using their arm to go back and forth. The pianist still has a tendency to rush forward a bit. I have a feeling it's because of the left hand, the notes that they're playing is really short. They could just have a little bit more length on each of them, which will help ground them into the tempo. This is another section where it starts to feel like it's rushing a bit. The pianist has more time than they think when transferring their arm from one place to another and that will help dictate the tempo. They should make sure that they're practicing slowly and have a sense that they have more time than they think they do. As the pianist is playing with their left hand, they can try to experiment with longer notes in the bass line to help shape the phrase.

This is an interesting choice. I would think that she would be putting oil into the pan as it's preheating instead of into the egg mixture. Here she is drizzling about a tablespoon of oil across the surface of the omelette pan. This is to ensure that the egg does not stick when it's added to the pan. She could also use butter or pan spray. Additionally, her flame has gone out on this particular eye and she struggles to get it re-lit, ultimately choosing to light the eye on the left-hand side. However, I would like to see her discard this eggshell immediately. Obviously, we mentioned her small workspace, but eggshells carry a lot of bacteria and dirt on them and you do want to immediately throw those away. After adding the red onions to her mixing bowl by hand, she slices her green pepper into very thin slices. or sorry this is ground turmeric the first was probably paprika or some other kind of ground red pepper. The tools that she will need are a small mixing bowl and the flat spatula, which you can see that she has gathered here. I do like that she is putting away her cutting board and her knife as she no longer needs them. Obviously I mentioned before, but she has a very limited workspace and this opens her up for better organization and better use of a small space. She removes the peel and cuts it in half and then slices each half crosswise and then turns those slices a quarter turn and cuts those into those slices into slices to create a fine dice. At this point, her omelet is most likely cooked. An omelet needs to cook about a minute and a half to two minutes on the first side and about 30 seconds on the second side. She does successfully turn the omelet after about a minute and a half of cooking, but she is obviously timid and fearful that it is going to tear. Using her flat metal spatula, she can go around the outsides of the omelet to ensure that they're not sticking. First, she cuts off both ends of the red onion with the onion in her left hand and using her right hand with the paring knife. I would never recommend cutting into your own hand, especially when you have a cutting board sitting right beneath you. I would always recommend cutting the onion in half lengthwise on the cutting surface to easily peel it. As she adds the omelet to the pan, it doesn't actually pour out into a perfect, you know, layer of circle. So she is attempting to use the back of the spoon to spread out the omelet so that it is in an even layer, so it cooks evenly. The first step in cooking an omelet is gathering all of the ingredients and the tools that you will need to complete the task. Here you can see that she has this omelet pan that she has put over medium heat. Here you can see that she is attempting to combine her eggs, vegetables, and seasoning all together in this small bowl with a spoon. I would recommend her using either a fork or a wire whisk in this scenario to incorporate more air into the mixture prior to adding it to the pan. Using the side of a spoon, she cracks her egg shell in half and then using both of her thumbs, she opens it directly into the mixing bowl. This is an appropriate way to open the egg without any eggs spilling onto your countertop. She could also tap it lightly on the edge of the bowl to crack it or, like I mentioned, on the edge of the countertop. Now she has a plastic cutting board in front of her and a paring knife. She is setting up her workspace. As you can see, this is a very limited or a small kitchen, so there's very limited workspace. And she's doing the best that she can, but she could keep a more organized kitchen to allow for more space to work. She drizzles a little bit more oil around the edge of the omelet. I'm not exactly sure why at this point this is the third time she's adding oil but I believe that she is fearful that the omelet is sticking. She's doing these steps a little in reverse. So she is seasoning the bowl, the mixing bowl, before anything is in it. This is about a half of a teaspoon of ground turmeric I believe. And the last step before serving is transferring your omelet from the pan to the serving tray here. And from the fridge, she gathers one egg, a small red onion, and a green pepper.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So we can see on our left hand screen here, right foot is about to pull the ball towards the left foot. And it's an inside to inside shuffle with one step in between. This will usually be used if we're being challenged by a player aggressively. So if they're coming towards the ball to win it here, or even if it's a 50-50 where we get to the ball slightly before the other player, it can again take the ball out of the path of the danger, which is coming again in this direction, and just move it across and forward to go around the danger. So a good 1v1 skill to use, a good ball retaining or a ball winning skill to use also if it's a loose ball. Here we're seeing a good scale if we look to the left hand side screen. The ball is going to move from left to right, back from right to left. This scale here is called a cow tail or a flick flack. It is basically a whip in motion. Right here we're seeing good technique because we have a knee here is outside the ball and what this allows us to do is when the ball is moved out here, the leg is extended from initial touch on the inside of the ball, we now must move our foot to the outside of the ball to push it back in this direction here. So it's a it's kind of a sign for this player that they have a good level of skill and they have a good level of experience because this is not an easy move but when you break the mechanics down it can be pulled off pretty effectively so we can see that this player is pretty experienced and skillful on the ball. So far, it's pretty much freestyling in terms of dribbling. There's not many repetitive sequences going on here that are super challenging and that are being pulled off super fast. It's pretty much kind of freestyling, going with the flow, pulling it back, moving it forward, turning with it. Again, no real sequence or challenge, just trying to move the ball, still seeing a good tempo of movement here with the ball and a nice high amount of touches per second, which again is high skill in itself, but I'm hoping to see some repetitive sequences here that we can kind of judge a little bit more on. So again, still seeing some good ball mastery. Some good manoeuvres with the ball. However, still quite casual in the stance and in the distance being covered. The person, the player is not covering a lot of distance in a short period of time. It's still quite high up in the stance on the turns, not getting down low with sharp cuts, just a lot of sole rolls, insides. So again, while this is good quality ball mastery, it is not quite up there at the very highest of the high end on the proficiency scale. So with there being no repetitive sequences in here yet I'm looking for some efficiency and where I can find some efficiency efficiency shown is In some of the combinations such as the sole roll to the inside of the foot There's a connected step and pattern within those ones and we're seeing them quite often So again, this is a showing me that the player is higher up on the proficiency scale However still want to see a little bit more if we're to push it a bit higher So we're still seeing a decent amount of touches per second here in more of a freestyling manner. I would still like to see some repetitive sequences being pushed here, so we could really see some speed and really get more of an understanding of proficiency here. But you know some of the criteria we are judging here upon being touches per second, tempo and so on, it's coming up at the higher end. But again I'd still like to see more speed in terms of the player moving and covering distance and also some repetitive sequences where we can look at efficiency, steps between touches and touch weight etc. Okay, so here we have a dribbling video. In this video I will be rating my proficiency based on some of the following factors. Fluidity of the movement, the surfaces of the foot that are being used while dribbling, is there a variety, is there not? The technique within the dribble, the stance and the centre of the gravity of the player when they're dribbling and turning, the ball speed and the tempo of the touches on the ball while the ball is in motion, repetitive and challenging sequences, are there any being put in there? The long length of repetitive sequences with speed increasing or at least being consistently high throughout and then also the amount of steps between the touches, are we trying to move the ball fast or are we taking light touches with a bunch of steps in between? So I will base my proficiency on some of these and I will also highlight some of these within the video. Another good combination I want to highlight here is an inside of the foot touch that moved into a sole roll to set up a scissors and then followed up by an outside hook. So four different moves combined very fluidly and efficiently which are pushing the proficiency of this one up. So last few combinations have been a lot of sole rolls to the inside of the opposite foot with a bit of a turn As we can see here quite a high stance Straight up. Look at the right hand side screen shoulders are high and Looking down You know, I think there's definitely room for more speed in this one And the stance also could be lowered to allow for faster movements sharper turning and and just a better protective stance of the ball and What we're seeing is kind of a casual speed with a casual stance not quite pushing The tempo as high as possible in this one Okay, so early on in this video we're seeing some good fluidity with high amount of touches per second. Some variety in there with the surfaces of the feet that are being used, lots of different surfaces being used here and being combined from bottom of the foot to inside and so on. It's very strong, more so on the ball mastery side so far where the ball is being moved but not quite top speed dribbling just yet. So a couple of things to note on the proficiency there.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Again, it's behind the line of the ball, so that continues to be an error for him. Number two here is that that toe is lower than the heel, because you can see the foot angle is like this in the picture. So what he's presenting then is more heel, actually, or a surface that's closer to his heel, which as he strikes, it could then force the ball to go wide or more this direction. And not really have a lot of power as well. So the correction there would be, get that plant foot next to the ball, get that toe up, heel down, get that body leaning over the ball, head down over the ball as much as possible, and then just overemphasize following through towards the target. Yeah, one thing I want to point out here is just that support foot, that plant foot is more pointed in this direction and then the target of where he's actually kicking is this way. So it's a little bit inefficient there. It can still be done, obviously, with the way in which he's kicking it. That's no problem. But he has to overcorrect with how he's following through the angle of this hip here. So that is something that he could actually just fix that by making this support foot point towards this way and using that as a target. The second thing here is because he's having to reach out and sort of extend for the ball in front of his support foot, in front of his body as he kicks it, you can see that that front toe is slightly pointed down and that heel is slightly higher than that one. It would be probably wiser or better for him if that heel was a little bit lower than the toe and it was maybe more like this. And then combine that with that foot facing this direction and getting that support foot closer to the ball or next to the ball and not leaning back as he hits the ball. It would be better if he was over the ball, head down over the ball, fully focused on the ball, and that would be helpful for this kick. Yeah, one thing just because he doesn't have like a big step into the ball and then a strike He's and he's trying to hit the ball very softly back towards this way more than likely because he doesn't want to hurt this player That's standing in the goal So there's very little power being generated because there's no back lift with the leg and then coming and kicking through So it's very minimal and not with a lot of speed in the knee action of what he bends it and then comes forward so that's number one there too is the The follow-through is a very short and shallow follow-through and again, this is because he's kicking from five yards away potentially So he doesn't need to generate a lot of power on this kick He's also not really really consistent with where he's choosing to hit the ball So what would be good for him actually is if he just had the same Repetition of shooting too low in this corner over and over again Let's say for an X number of reps or five number of reps I think it would help him train a technique more repetitively And this is one thing I do like that he's done pretty consistently here is that as the ball is rolling this direction He's stepping forward to come meet the ball and I like that a lot actually He's not just waiting for the ball to arrive and then initiate a kicking action And you can see that he's tracking the ball with his eyes his heads down tracking that there as he takes that step So I like that I think for this skill. I think that's good So one thing just to say here that this video is labeled as a penalty kick. I'm assuming this player is acting as a goalkeeper, but the player that's kicking or working, this subject is actually hitting a rolling ball that's being kind of bowled back towards him and then he's kicking the ball either away from this goalkeeper or the player on the goal or he's kicking directly back at him and he'll repeat this process by bowling the ball back out. So number one is that it's not replicating an actual penalty kick. This is more like a partner passing and receiving exercise. A penalty kick would be that the ball is placed in a stationary position every single repetition and the kicking player runs up and kicks the ball against a direct opponent with the aim or intention of trying to put the ball into the goal. Yeah, again, just looking at the contact point of the ball, he's having to lean back every single time because of where he's contacting this ball. Very far in front of his body. Very clearly that you can see that there. And the intention of this foot going this direction, and then his contact is trying to force the ball to go that direction. So all that combined, actually, it just doesn't allow him to generate a lot of force if he was trying to hit this with any power. Again, just going to be that he gets the plant foot next to the ball, align his hips more appropriately with his target, and then inside of the foot here, really trying to hit the center of the foot at a lower contact point or a mid-ball contact point. I think all those things combined would start to help these be better looking ball strikes. Yeah, I mean, really consistent theme for him is there's this constant like slight lean back in his upper body, which is away from the ball. And that support foot is consistently kind of going like this direction here. So if he could fix that, I would say get that support foot next to the ball more pointed towards his intended target. That could be one criteria or one thing that he could improve. The second thing is that would naturally then allow that upper body to be a little bit more over the ball. We want to keep correcting that so that he has better balance and less of a chance of contacting the ball out in front of his body, which is what he's tending to do here. And that increases the risk of that ball rising up into the air unless he just under hits it. So something to consider how we can control the trajectory of the ball a little bit better. Yeah, so just looking at the technique then of hitting like a rolling ball that's moving back towards him. You can see here that the contact point of the ball is slightly in front of his body and the plant foot is a little bit behind the ball as he's making contact. You can see that ball just leaving his foot at this point in the picture. As much as he can, like if he wants to keep the ball on the ground, the recommendation would be to try to get that plant foot a little bit more next to the ball as he initiates his kicking sequence. If he's contacting the ball out in front of his body, you can see that's why he has like this upper body lean sort of in that direction. So the only way to keep it low then would be one to control his power, like how hard he kicks the ball back and return. And then the other point would be like he's kicking the ball more at the midline or midpoint of the ball, which will help kind of go like smooth to keep the ball lower to the ground versus if he hit the ball very low, low towards the ground below that center line, then that would force the ball to pop up into the air.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She played those arpeggios very beautifully and evenly. To play an arpeggio with one hand can be tricky, but to play them with both hands and to go up that many octaves up and down at that speed with that amount of clarity and evenness is very hard to do, and she did it very beautifully. As she's playing this really fast flurry of notes, she's having to move her hand up a little bit to reach the black keys and then back down to get to some of the white keys. This fast flurry of notes sounds incredibly fluid in legato and both hands are playing really with a nice touch and not too much weight. She's moving from three positions on the keyboard. She's about right there and then had to move her hands right there and then to about this range here. And so as she's having to move her hands across the keyboard, she's keeping a unified sound between both hands and getting to each position accurately. Before she starts to play some arpeggios, she has all of her fingers set in the correct spots before she goes. So the C, E, and G are ready to go there. The C, the E, and the G are ready to go there as well. And she has all her fingers placed really close to where she needs to be able to play. She has to extend her hand position quite a bit to reach the G sharp with her pointer finger and the F here with her pinky. She played this scale with all the correct finger numbers and all the correct notes as she went up and down. And again, she did this with both hands very fluidly and very evenly, showing a lot of coordination and skill playing at that tempo. As she shifts into the next position to play the next set of arpeggios, her thumb kind of goes underneath the rest of her fingers, and has this very fluid motion where her elbows are having to kind of rotate a little bit, and so that way she keeps the motion fluid and relaxed.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As we look on the right frame on our offensive player's finish, in his left-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice that the player does really well at controlling his body and not allowing his momentum to take him away from the basket, but instead allowing his momentum to carry him towards the basket, giving the ball a better opportunity of having the accuracy and power it needs to hit our targeted area on the backboard and creating a proper angle of dropping through the net, resulting in a completed layup attempt. As we look at the player go into his left-handed reverse layup attempt on his release, on the right frame we can notice that the player does really well at jumping at his maximum effort, having his momentum go towards the rim, allowing the ball to create the right amount of force it needs to be able to hit our targeted area and to have the proper angle and touch it needs to drop through the net, resulting in the completed layup. As we focus our attention on the left frame, we can notice that the player does really well in his follow-through release hand, having it turned left, directed towards our targeted area, which is the rim, also allowing the ball to create the proper rotation and spin it needs to be able to hit our targeted area, which is the top left corner on the backboard, creating a proper angle to be able to drop through the net, resulting in a completed layup attempt. A slight adjustment we can make to help the offensive player create more security and protection on the ball is to bring his ball placement position closer towards his chest and body and also a little bit higher towards his shoulder area. This will allow more security and protection, preventing defenses to be able to have easy access of stripping, taking, or stealing the ball. As we look at the left frame, we can notice again that the player does really well at his follow-through, having his hand rotated towards the left, which creates the right amount of spin and rotation the ball needs to be able to be directed towards our targeted area, which is the left top corner of the box on the backboard, allowing the ball to create the proper angle it needs to drop through the net. As we look at the player go into his gather attempt for his left-handed reverse layup, again, as we look on the right frame, the player does really well at locating and locking his eyes on his target. Also, we will want the player to create more security and protection on the ball and to not have it exposed out to allow defenders to be able to have easy access of stripping the ball causing an offensive turnover for the player. So we will want the ball placement to be closer towards his chest area and a little bit higher towards his shoulders. As we shift our attention to the left frame, we can notice that the player again does really well in his follow through rotating hand, pointing his five fingers towards our targeted area, which allows the ball to create the proper spin and rotation it needs to be able to, as you see, hit our targeted area, the top left corner of the box on the backboard. And this will allow the ball to create a proper angle to be able to drop through the net, resulting in a successful layup attempt. As we look at the player go into his left-handed reverse layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice that the player does really well at locating his target with his eyes to create a much easier finish. As we look at the right frame, again to create more security and protection on the ball and from defenders, we will want the offensive player to bring his ball placement position closer towards his body and higher towards his shoulder area to prevent defenders from having easy access of stripping, taking, or stealing the ball in a game-like scenario. As we look at the offensive player release on the right frame into his left-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice that the player does really well at jumping towards the basket, allowing the ball and creating the ball enough power and accuracy it needs to be able to hit our targeted area, creating a proper angle to drop through the net. Bringing the ball closer to the offensive player's body will also put pressure on referees to overlook defenders coming across the body to try to steal, take, or strip the ball, resulting in a foul call and two free throws at the line. Another detail that the player does really well into his left-handed reverse layup attempt. On the right frame, we can notice that the player has the correct footwork by stepping with his left foot first and jumping off his right jumping leg.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So he's got this big hold here and he actually goes up, tries to match his hand up above and then drops his hand below as he attempts to kind of use this one to kind of pull to the left.

I would encourage this dancer to really think about attack of the steps and really have energy while they're dancing and really think about, again, attacking the steps or putting a lot of effort into doing each movement so their body can kind of make decisions and not second guess themselves. When you attack or you have precision when you're dancing, it forces the mind and the body to connect and therefore make some decisions about where you would like to go next. Which again, performing this basic choreography, it at least shows us what the basic choreography is supposed to be, right? I would encourage the dancer to really study the rhythm because they're off the music and off the beat. So really taking the time to listen to the music and digest the music and learn the rhythms and then applying that to the body is very important. I would encourage the dancer to use their arms as an anchor and to kind of help them with direction. So if they're going forward, move their arm forward. If they're going back, swing their arms back and kind of use it to help them stay on the rhythm and power through the movement, using their arms as an anchor and having strength and power behind those arms. Here, I would encourage the dancer to really snap that foot back. So tap on the ball of the foot and quickly snap that foot back. Same thing, tap, snap, tap, snap, right? When I say snap, I mean like bring that foot back to the center of their body and then back out, right? So they're quickly tapping and bringing it back in. It's quickly tapping and bringing it back in. And of course, I would encourage them to be more grounded so they can do this quickly and more efficiently because they have a greater range of motion. This would improve the overall performance quality of this basic choreography. To improve this step, I would encourage the dancer to first plie or bend their legs and to open their legs a little bit So they kind of have this wide squatting position And grounded position to have more agility to be able to move in all directions Quickly with the music", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And this is also a great example of a plie or bending the leg. I would just again encourage them to have more power and strength through the arm. The dancer does a really great job of having musicality. However, there are instances where they seem like there may be a half a second off. So over anticipating the music is a good skill for this dancer in order to really stay on the rhythm throughout the entire dance. I would encourage the dancer at this moment to have a little bit more hustle or to again over anticipate the movement so it looks energetic and it's exciting to watch which is always important in dance. Just want to highlight, this is the first time I've actually seen this, the circular, the use of the arms while they're doing this body roll. And I really appreciate that in this moment. And I also appreciate the foot articulation, the bend of the legs, the torso and the hip engagement as well. I would encourage this dancer for the step, step, slide, step, step, slide to take bigger steps and bigger slides in order to accentuate the movement and the dynamic quality within this basic salsa. I think if the dancer was to take bigger steps and even elongate this plie when they're doing this circular motion or pattern on the floor, they would be able to carve through space and take up more space, which would create an even better, more dramatic, dynamic quality in this movement. This dancer does a really good job at this skill of spotting, which I talk about a lot, where you look at one point and then you whip your head around and then the rest of your body follows in this to be able to turn faster without getting dizzy. This dancer does a really great job of spotting. So just wanted to show a positive example of that. I would encourage this dancer to use their back and let their arm flow from their back to elongate all the way out through their fingertips as they reach side to side and continue to plie or bend through their legs in order to have more strength and power behind the movement.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So again, it does a good job of getting good height as the ball hits the top of the square, but since it's inside of the square, we don't want to use any side spin at all. Little to no side spin. Most likely inside the square we don't want any side spin at all, especially from this position. But since a little bit of side spin was used and the ball made contact on the backboard inside of the square, it spinned off the backboard and then it just hit the inside of the right portion of the rim and the side spin on it rolled around and around and ended up coming out and we turned a layup into an in and out miss layup. So when you see balls roll around the rim and then it misses out, the phrase you hear most commonly for that is in and out. The shot looked like it was going in, but for some reason or another it ended up scooping out and we missed the shot. The reason in this particular case is because of the side spin on the ball when the ball made contact on the backboard inside of the square. The player places the ball on the backboard slightly outside of the square, but it has good height as it's near the top level of the square. So from this position here, in order for us to make the shot, we need to make sure we have good side spin, which the player does, and the ball spins off of the backboard and into the basket. So this was a good use of side spin. After we make the layup on the mic and drill, and we catch the ball out of the net, we do not want the ball to drop down below our waist. When we catch the ball out of the net, we want to keep the ball high around our upper chest shoulder area. Two hands on the ball, keep it high, be strong, and then we take, we use the proper footwork to relocate to the opposite side of the basket and we shoot the layup on the opposite side of the floor. In this case, the player allowed the ball to drop down too low. The ball makes contact with the backboard slightly outside of the square but it also has really good height as it's above the level of the top of the square. Since it's outside of the square we need a good amount of side spin on the ball in order for it to spin off of the backboard and go into the basket. This is another example of good use of side spin this time on the left side of the basket with our left hand to get the ball to spin off of the backboard and into the basket when the ball makes contact with the backboard outside of the square. As the player is catching the ball out of the net, he already has his foot planted, his right foot planted, and it doesn't move until he shoots the ball again. And as he steps, he's bringing his left foot and putting it down here next to his right foot and then jumping up to shoot. As the ball is coming out of the net, his right foot shouldn't be in this spot. You want to, as the ball is coming down, we're stepping with this left foot to the position where this right foot is. And as we catch the ball, if we're jumping off of one foot, if we're doing a one-foot mic and drill, we'll just jump off the left foot when we put it down here in this position and jump up and shoot the ball with our right hand. If we're doing a two-foot mic and drill, which this player is doing right now, when we step with that left foot here, that right foot, which will be back over here in this area if we're doing the drill with the correct footwork, as we catch the ball and that left foot goes down, the right foot will swing around to square ourselves up and then we go up for the shot. So this is an example of the need for us to use the proper footwork.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They put in a really good effort, but I think they can overall have more attack, more groundedness, and really think about being precise in their movement to help their overall proficiency in this intermediate salsa. Sometimes it seems like they get a little bit caught up and that their torso is moving faster than their hips. And the way to have more range of motion and move quickly, of course, is to engage that core and make sure that they're grounded, bending those knees. I would encourage the dancer to really dig in and find the rhythm. Sometimes they're a little bit off of the music and catching up to the musicality. Even when they haven't officially started the movement yet, this really understanding of the rhythm will set you up for failure or success. So really taking the time to study this movement is super important. Overall, I think the dancer needs more attack, right? And making sure that they're moving really quickly and efficiently, and really drilling moving fast. And thinking about, in order to drill moving fast, one way to do that is to think about the transitions and how you get from one step to the next step.

However, they're still having trouble with their heel toe surface where their toe is pointed down and their heel up, which makes the foot slightly less accurate and gives the ball less of a surface to hit off of. One thing they are doing well though is maintaining a locked ankle position, which allows the ball to be redirected somewhat sharply or with accuracy rather than if you have a limp ankle, the ball will tend to skid off in all different directions. The last few sequences show a better heel-toe relationship with his right foot, but a relatively poor one with his left foot. And the last three, you've been able to see that he tends to leave his non-dominant foot with the toe down and the heel up, which makes those passes inaccurate. Whereas his right foot tends to have a better heel-toe relationship and more of a lock, which makes them more accurate. It's an excellent visual in order to see how you can create a better heel-toe relationship, which will lead to more accuracy. Here is a good example of one of the continued mistakes, which is the heel toe relationship from, again, wanting the heel down and the toe up to him having his heel up and toe down. It makes it for an inaccurate surface. We're here after it hits his foot in this position, it shanks off slightly to the left because the clean surface was not there and it must have redirected slightly off his toe or bottom of his cleat. Again, to improve this, have the heel down and the toe locked. In this frame, he does a much better job of having that relationship where the heel is pointed slightly down and the toe is pointed up, which allows it to create a much flatter or horizontal surface, which reacts into having a more accurate pass. Again, the key element here is that you want to be able to step into the pass with your heel down and toe up in a locked position, with the ball going directly back from where you receive it. The next part of this setup, besides the athletic position, which includes the lower center of gravity and being on the balls of the feet, which in this frame, the player is doing a better job of, is taking a small half step in towards where the ball is coming from. This allows you to meet the ball with your technique in a proper circumstances with your timing. If you allow the ball to continue to roll into you, usually you will have less power and less accuracy and you tend to let the ball bounce or move too closely to you before you step. The big thing here is, as the ball arrives, take a small step towards the ball, which allows you to adjust your technique and redirect the ball in the direction you want. The first part of receiving and returning a pass with one touch is how you set up your body position. Here, the player is much too upright. He needs to bend his knees and be more on the balls of both feet so he can react if the ball is to the right or to the left of him. Depending on the direction of the service, he will need to quickly make adjustments in order to return the pass properly. Here, he is too flat-footed. You can see he is on the heels of this foot. You can also see that he is much too upright with no bend in his knee. The third element would be his follow-through. After his pre-touch balancing and body positioning and then the actual strike surface, for the follow-through of a short one-touch pass, you actually don't want it to be too elongated. Rather, you want it to be firm and sharp the way he has it. This makes it so the pass return is weighted properly, rather than if you follow through too hard, the ball will be shot at your partner with too much speed. Again, the short sharp follow-through, again keeping it close to his body, makes it so rather than the ball goes back with a ton of pace, it's simply returned with about the same amount of power you received it in. The next technical element would be the actual strike surface you create for the ball. For an inside of the foot return pass, you want your heel down and your toe up. In this sequence, you can see that he has his heel up and his toe down. This is an extremely inaccurate surface. You want this relationship to be inverse with the heel down and the toe up in a locked position. In the last few sequences, the player has done a better job of maintaining a slightly more athletic stance with bending his knees, staying more balanced, ready to move by not allowing his feet to plant too heavily, and he's doing a better job of stepping into his pass. This allows him to control the pace of the ball and have more accuracy. His setup in the last few sequences has been closer to adequate or proficient, which is allowing his passes to be more accurate. With his pre-touch movement, you can also see where, again, having your feet flat-footed and your center of gravity high makes you very reactive to the ball. Rather than taking small micro-adjustments to get an accurate pass, he again finds himself heavily planted in reaching across with improper technique, which leads to inaccurate passes. Most of this can be prevented by lowering your center of gravity and being on the balls of your feet, which will allow you to react and position yourself better to the ball rather than be reactive and try to fix already improper technique. Although initially the player was using a two-touch sequence where they received, took a touch, and then passed back with the next touch, for the majority of the video, at about 26 seconds in, they revert to just one-touch passing. Something that he's been inconsistent with, but when he tends to do it, his passes are better, is taking that final step towards the ball when he's getting ready to pass, rather than waiting on his heels for the ball to come to him. Whenever he does this, he tends to have more accuracy. Here, he does an excellent job of stepping into his pass, which allows him to set it quickly back to his teammate. In the last few sequences, his heel-toe relationship has improved slightly, but again, his pre-touch movements have gone back to the default, which where he tends to be very flat-footed and very upright with his heels planted heavily in the ground, which one for his pre-touch makes it so this foot should be pointed towards where he wants to pass rather than this direction. But because of he's flat-footed, he tends to not step into the ball and get this body reaction and then also again, lower center of gravity, so rather than being reactive, he can anticipate and move for a better setup before he passes. However, he has improved in his heel-toe relationship, which means his passes have been relatively accurate in the last few sequences. Here, although he's not necessarily in an athletic position because he's still too upright and the knees are bent, both of his feet are on the balls rather than the heels. And you can see he's taking a step in towards the ball where you want to pass or where he wants the pass to go. This will allow him to control his technique and meet the ball on his terms, rather than waiting too long and letting the ball to meet him. So although he's missing some technical elements, here's he's doing a good job of taking a step towards the ball and meeting it, which will allow for a more accurate and firm pass. As previously stated, if you're not in an athletic position, which includes lowering your center of gravity with knee bent and being on the balls of your feet, which allow you to react and move either side, you end up in situations like this, where rather than moving and shifting his body in order to use proper technique, he's reaching across himself off balance to get the ball. Because he was too heavily planted on this foot, his brain automatically lifts his dominant foot and makes him reach off balance to return a pass that will most likely involve poor technique. The player here now is working on a one-touch passing sequence. This involves a partner passing into their feet directly and then returning the pass with either the right or the left foot. One-touch return passing or setting is a common action in soccer that all players need to work on and execute properly in order to play at higher levels.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Later on, once the climber has engaged on the flag and uses the toe to push, it will help him with gaining direction when going out right for the reach, as well as supporting the climber to keep his center of gravity close to the area of support, which later on when he goes into the reach, he keeps his right side, which will benefit for his extension going out right against the wall. Because the climber was able to secure the grip with the left hand, the climber was able to relocate his knee drop to be an extended and push down on the toe maintaining the foot placement. And this one he extends it this time to allow transferring the weight over to the highest foot being in place. And as we can see his right hand has come out of the pinch to make the placement to the next hold. The climber being in two solid grips, meaning that the climber is able to wrap the hands on the holes, the left hand being a jug and the right hand being a positive pinch, meaning that has holes on each side where the climber can curl the fingers. He's able to lean back and apply pressure that way only by engaging the fingers and not the arms. This is called the rest position and he is only placement on the wall for his feet as a left foot so he needs to continually make sure that when he leans back he tries to bring his hips close to the wall so he can transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place. At this moment he spends some time looking down for making a placement of the right toe so the grips right now are solid but the climber also needs to make sure he doesn't take so much time because it will tire the climber out eventually since he will need to continue to have endurance to finish the climb. Here the climber has send the right hand up for the next move, this one being a jug. The climber is able to wrap the hand on the edge of the hold, this one being a lip. So the climber curls the fingers behind it and applies pressure by leaning on it, pulling on the hold. The climber now having the arm extended, this tells me that he is not engaging the arm and only the grip and is able to glance down at the foot once securing that grip to release pressure at the feet, especially on the left foot which was the one placed the lowest, now to come into a higher stance. Here the climber is made the right hand up for another pinch hold. In this one the climber before engaging onto that reach he had extended the arms this to be in the rest position which is good of the climber to first examine the wall and not engage the arms and whenever he's ready he then will engage onto a slight pull up to make the move. As we can see the left leg has been extended during this period and this is to make the climber feel stable when on the wall. Also to not have him swing to the left side he places the left foot on it. This leg extended is called back, it's called flagging out which helps the climber to also transfer the weight over the high foot that is the one that is being in position. As the climber engaged on the pull-up to make the move out left, coming into another pinch for the left hand, the climber had kept the right leg extended and had pressed the toe against the wall. This was helping the climber to when he was gain, not only to gain height, but only also to gain direction as he was moving out to the left. The climber is bringing the left hand up for a match, meaning that both hands are in the same hold and being a jug makes it easier for the climber to sustain the hold. Now the climber at this moment is doing a foot switch so he needs to constantly apply pressure down at the feet by bringing the right foot in, placing the toe on the hold and once the climber has contact and pressure then the climber is able to release the left toe out of the hold. The climber has swapped his placement of the left hand on the pinch and instead tries to secure the grip by sending the outer side of the hand to be facing towards the wall. That way the climber is able to have a more of a closed grip which gives it more power to the grip by sending the fingers onto one side and then he's pressing with the bottom ball of the palm on the other side to engage on that pinch. It's important on the placement of where the hand on the pinch will do it so he brings the outer side of the hand towards the wall as far in. Now the climber had made a right foot placement which is necessary as the climber is going to go out for the next hold at a reach. So it's important the climber has secured a foot placement before going up for the next move. The climber has made the reach to a pinch hold. The climber is sending the hand obviously with the fingers being on the outside and the thumb to be above the hold in this instance. So in order for the climber to create pressure he's gonna have to really engage on that thumb to lean weight onto it as he curls the thumb to make a press at the top while the fingers try to go out into a squeeze to the hold. In this case the climber needs to remain with the wrist pointing out right in order to pull the hold and before the climber got to the reach he had to make sure he had a good foot positioning. First he had sent the right foot into a high placement to let her release it when he was trying to gain momentum to make the reach. In this case the right leg potentially is extended to help him transfer the weight over to the left foot which is the one that he needed to rely on to later on also engage on the pull up to the reach. The climber originally had brought his right hand to an open hand pinch that was sloped, so it wasn't a very secure grip and quickly trying to make a foot placement on the left foot, the climber then chooses to bump up to the final hold. This one the climber is able to apply the fingers above and as we can see is flat at the top, so the climber must place the fingers meeting the hold and create friction as well as bending the hand by the knuckles to create force on the pull. The climber must stay underneath the hold in order to sustain the grip. The climber here is starting at a sit start. Sit starts are known to be adding to the grade of difficulty to the climb. This is because the climber will need to bring his weight to the limbs that are positioned onto the wall. Once the climber has raised the hips and is on the wall, then the climb will start. The climber was able to make the placement of the left hand on the next hold Potentially being a pinch as we can see there is a thumb underneath placed and then the fingers are placed above Now in order for the climber to make this reach it was important how he made his body positioning he had sent his right foot to come into a high placement and He has brought then he has used a knee drop on The left leg a knee drop can also function as a flagging if the climber Is not able to take out The foot out of the wall in order to keep his center of gravity close to the wall. So The climber engaged the knee drop by pivoting his foot to Twist in words is slightly to allow the knee drop this can Actually add some strain into the knee so this is only going to be used when on a quick move and The knee drop considered to be used on the same way as flag is only done on overhang walls like this one As we can see the climber is pushing against the hold. This one is a hold that is not on his sequence and it should have been pushed against the wall. This is something that the climber needs to be aware when making foot placements. In this instance, the climber is glancing down at the feet. This is because he needs to make a more accurate foot switch. First, he will need to bring the left toe to come into placement to the foot hold before he releases the right toe out of place. This not only the climber is engaging more force in the grips to release some of the pressure down at the feet, but the climber needs to constantly keep pressure down at the foot so his foot doesn't come out of place and then he'll avoid from going out on a swing. When the climber was making the left hand placement to the final hold, he's coming to a match, and in that moment the right foot had come out of place. In order for the climber to complete the climb, he only needs to hold on to that final hold with both hands for 3 seconds in order to complete the climb. It's important that the climber looks down at the feet. In this instance the climber is doing a foot swap. So the climber must bring himself as close as he can to the wall engaging on a pull up to apply more pressure at the grips. This way the climber is able to bring his right foot in top of the hold and able to release the left foot from placement. In this case the climber is doing a foot hop which means that he is actually engaging more of the grip in this case because the climber is jumping over the hold in order to make the placement. He's able to do this confidently because the hold is big enough for the climber to make the foot placement. As we can see, the climber is starting at a one-hold start, meaning that both of the hands will be placed in the same hold. This is called matching. And the way that the climber is holding onto the grip is called pinch. So the pinch grip works as the climber wraps the hand around the hold with the fingers on top and the thumb at the bottom. The thumb will create pressure on the squeeze. And once the climber is ready to be positioned with the feet on the wall, in this case, the left foot is the one that is at highest placement, the climber then will have to engage into a pull-up to make his next move, assuming that he's going to the left due to the hold being marked, as well as the high foot placement, and he is glancing over to that side.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This one now the climber maintains an extension of the leg, not only because he only just lose the contact but continues to keep it on even if applied force onto the grip above. This is called flagging and the climber is keeping it there extended because it helps the climber transfer over the weight of his center of gravity over to the highest foot, helping also with the climber twist of his body to keep his hips and shoulder close to the wall. Being on the left side of his body helps the climber when making their reach. Here when the climber was trying to make a placement of the right foot on a hold, his body swung to the right and immediately the climber took advantage of the momentum to send the left hand to match at the same hold. This one is positive in both sides so the climber is able to wrap the hand side to side of the hold and sustain it on the grip by pinching it with the thumbs and pulling also on a close pull up to sustain pressure onto the hold. That way the climber is able to tense the body engaging the core and pressing down on the foot to stabilize the swing and the climber now sends the left foot to what seems to be the edge of the hold. This the climber then will gain more stability once making that placement. Here the climber has brought the left toe to come to a match onto the same hold. This the climber can push away from the hold so that he's able to lean back and creating a lean back that goes in the direction to the left. This helps the climber to sustain the grip with sufficient pressure at the top which makes it easy for the climber to release the right hand from the hold that he had it in place. This is called the rest position when both of the arms are extended especially he's able to send one arm down to shake it off and release any tension that has been built up. This will help the climber to re-energize the right arm when having to come back to the wall. Once the climber is done resting the right arm he will come and bring it to place potentially onto the same hold that he's holding on to the left hand. This one because it's a jug the climber can easily place the right hand next to it. As we can see, since the climber has been able to apply sufficient pressure at the grip, the climber then can release pressure down at the feet. The climber brings the left foot to come into placement where the left hand hold is. This is called matching when both of the limbs are in the same hold. He does this by bringing the front ball of the foot to be applied on top of the edge. When the climber needs to engage on the toe pressure against the hold, he will have to roll the toe into the hold in order to sustain pressure and transfer the weight over to the highest foot, this one being the one that he has brought to a match. The climbers is starting at a sit start, meaning that the climber is seated on the mat and once the climber makes the placement of the hands and the feet on the wall, he will need to raise his hips. That way the climber is transferring the weight over to the areas in contact with the wall. Sit starts are known to be difficult to come off from, so they will add a grade of difficulty into the climb. The climber is aiming right now at a hold that is a distance. This one, the climb, would ideally send the left hand up to the hold. This because it's important that the climber does not force the pull in a way that would compromise sending his center of gravity away from the wall. So he does this by placing the right foot to be above the jug, which makes it easier for the climber to sustain once making the stance. It works by the climber first keeping his left foot on the jug down below. He will then engage on a jump by extending the lower leg to push the climber away from the wall. At the same time, the climber will then engage the arms onto a pull up so that he can gain height. Now that the climber once gains the height, the climber then will be able to engage the right toe to be curled in to be placed on top of the edge of the hold. This is where the climber then will transfer the weight of his center of gravity over to the highest foot, allowing him to gain more reach for him to easily replace bringing the left hand up to be placed on the top hold. That all this motion, while this is happening, the climber then needs to continually keep his left side against the wall so that his center of gravity stays close to the wall and makes it easy for the climber when making the reach. The climber here had made a slight swing in order to build momentum to the climber make a dynamic placement of the hand up to the hold. As he extended the lower leg for the climber to gain height. The climber had released the right foot and while he released it he brought his right hand to come into a match at the jug above. Quickly, once the climber's right hand came to match, the climber sends the right toe to the edge of the jug. This one, same way, the climber applies the toe above the edge and when the climber is going to utilize the high foot when making a stance to the next hold, he will be curling the toe into the hold in order to sustain pressure. The climber here is making some hand gestures. This will help the climber to have an idea of how to follow the sequence and what hand placement he will need to perform when climbing the wall. The climber trying to gain a stability over the swing. The climber then immediately sends the right hand to stabilize the swing, placing the right hand onto the last hold. Unable to stabilize the swing, the climber then presses down on the left foot immediately by extending the leg. Now the climber is creating pressure that pushes the hold away and the right foot is continuing to sustain his weight and by pushing the hand to the opposite direction, the climber is able to stabilize his swinging and immediately sends the left hand after stopping the swing to come into a match at the last hold. After the climber sustains the hold for three seconds, then the climb has been completed. Here, once the climber had achieved the left hand grip, he quickly engages into a forceful pull up and pushes down on the right foot that should still be in place and keeping the left leg extended for flagging out. This so that the climber continues to apply pressure onto the right foot and send the right hand quickly after the pull up to be engaged into another positive hold as the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold. Here the climber had extended the right foot to come into place. This helped the climber to have two areas of support down at the feet when making the reach to the top hold, this one being a jug. Again the climber is able to comfortably sustain the grip as he's able to wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold which is also another convenient hold like a jug which is also a beginner's hold for climbers when they start climbing. In this case the climber also extended the leg and once the climber applies pressure to the hold above he can keep it extended and this time he will use it as flagging out as he would probably don't need pressure on the foot that is farthest away. Then this foot eventually being on a flag will help for the climber to transfer over the center of gravity, the lates on the core and the hips to be transferred to the left foot that's placed up higher than the right foot. The climber starts when the climber gets to raise the hips off the mat and in this case he quickly made a movement of the right hand to come off to the next move. This one being a jug, so the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the edge of the hold which seems to be positive. This is one of the beginner holds, so the climber is able to rely on the grip and once placing pressure and closing the grip the climber can release the engagement of the arm. Here the climbers is starting at a two hand hold start, which each hand will be holding on to what seems to be an indent edge, meaning that it's positive, so the climber is able to place the fingertips far in by the wall and he will be able to lay the fingers flat at the top edge and then able to hook on the hold when sustaining the grip.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And you know, and ideally you want to jump straight up, straight down. Cause if there's a defender, you don't have a lot of room to come down. And it might be even hard for you to shoot like that and land like that if there's defense there. But again, his weight's forward, he's off balance. Not, he's trying to hold that follow through out there. I'd love it to be a little more in line with the basketball. Again, not bad here. He's got pretty good decent form. Maybe the guide hand, just the way it's on the basketball, but definitely he's shooting with one hand. See these two fingers? That's what, they're the last two fingers that you want leaving the ball. So well done there. Here he gets ready again just pauses. Too much time. This this sense of hesitation here or pausing will allow the defense to recover and therefore you will be guarded. We got to catch and shoot quicker and a lot has to do with your body language prior to the pass. Again, he lands with all his weight in front of that right knee, because he's really kind of, instead of shooting, he's kind of trying to push the ball with that right hand. And by using, but not preparing ahead of time, he's really having to step out and push it out with one foot. This foot. Hold that follow-through. See how the elbow goes out? We want to keep it out straight, extended. Again, see the landing with that staggered landing. A little bit too much weight on that lead knee. We want it to be more, you know, dropping the hips with our feet under those hips. Not bad extension. Follow through. Here's the basketball. Here, you know, he catches the ball. He didn't really even move his feet to catch it. So therefore, you're not getting a lot of legs here. I mean, if this was a free throw, that'd be fine. But let's step into this pass, catch and shoot. And here's how he's catching it. Ideally, if he's right-handed, I'd love for this right hand to come around and like backstop it like a mitt, like a softball baseball glove. Backstop it, and then use this guide hand, the left hand, which is his non-shooting hand, to help guide it into this hand. And then you're ready to catch and shoot. Your hands are ready, place on the ball the way you want it. And then here's the shot. Ball somewhere up here. Here's his follow-through. Again, you know, off balance. Hands are down. Great job keeping the eyes and head up. I think maybe that's the ball. See how he lands with one foot way out in front of the other. He turns that hip in, not really square to the basket. Good follow-through, stays with it. That's very nice. Again, you know, he's going from a stand-up, straight, vertical, locked-out position to just trying to jump straight-legged. It's hard to jump when your knees are locked out. I would just encourage him to be kind of bend those knees, just have a softer body positioning. We need more legs and power to get the ball to the rim. Great 90% upper body here. Good extension of the elbow. Ball comes off these finger pads. Let's drop this elbow in. Bend that elbow, forearm parallel to the floor. See how he's leaning in? Like he's having to jump forward. Ideally drop those hips, lower their legs, jump straight up, jump straight down. Good extension here. Nice snapping of the wrists. Keep this palm of the left hand facing in. It doesn't really have to move or do anything. It just stays as it is. Here comes the shot. He really he does get off the ground a little bit just from that stationary position Just imagine how much he could get use of legs if he prepared a little bit again, though He's we love for him to he falls forward. We'd love for him to jump straight up and come straight down Not bad extension here guide hand much better here that elbows bent stays stationary Snapping of the wrist that gives that ball that rotation that you want to see as it makes its way to the rim Again, here comes the pass. I think he would really benefit if he would just get ready more. Here's the line. Maybe step left, right, or at least bend the knees, drop the hips. Have the hands and arms up. Catch the ball with your eyes. See the ball into your hands and transfer your vision to the rim. Again, his landing way out here in front of that right knee. He's definitely off balance. Here's the basketball. Nice job holding that follow-through. Here he begins to shoot. He is going up on his balls of his feet. He is extending his hips. Here's a good look. Not bad at all. He's got his shooting hand behind the ball, elbow in, guide hand comes off. Let's maybe move that elbow in a little bit, but overall not bad there. It's just he's having to really push it and fall forward which causes him to be off balance. But as he shoots, he brings that right leg forward. Any of this extra movement of the body can throw off the accuracy of the ball as it's in route to the basket. I like this. Breaking of the wrist. We've got to get that shooting elbow in more in line with the wrist. Here the shooter is shooting a 15 footer. I love that he's, you know, getting off the ground here a little bit, but see how he's really, he's having to really push the ball and really take, he kind of falls forward, like has to, it's almost like he's pushing off the left foot only and really falling forward here. See how he's leaning. Ideally we want to be, to jump straight up, be more vertical and land more vertically. He's right-handed, so good follow through with the right hand and wrists. Maybe get that right elbow in a little bit and just hold that guide hand out there. I think he jerks the guide hand in a little bit, but I love that guide hand just to stay in, stay still where it is, not be involved in the shot. Here comes the pass. Is he ready? Is he what we call a ready shooter? And I would love to see this shooter bend those knees, put one foot in front of the other, drop his hips, have his hands, arms up, ready to receive this pass. Go get it. Go meet it. Get those legs under you so that you can jump up. Again, shooting hand behind the ball, not too bad here. Guide hand is there and it comes off, so great job there. Maybe get that guide elbow in just a tad. Again, goes up on the balls of his feet, extends his hips. I'd love to see him get off the ground here a little bit more. Again, not bad shooting form and technique. Let's get that guiding palm facing in. I love how the ball comes off these pads of the fingers. That's what you want to see. We'd love to see more leg, use of the legs to get him jumping and off the ground. Here again is the shot. He's kind of just pushing it out there. See this big step forward like all his weight's forward on that lead foot. Not real balance. Again his follow-through is kind of off to the right. We want it to be a little bit higher in line with the basketball as it makes its way to the rim. Again, looks like he pulls the left elbow back, see the left arm. See that guide hand just needs to stay stationary. We don't want it to be moving at all. Elbow in of the right arm. Let's get everything in line with this wrist. Again, here comes the pass. I always say to my players, are you ready to catch and shoot? Well, he's got it. He's standing straight up, so he's not ready. Again, let's put one foot behind the other, bend our knees, drop our hips, have our hands and arms out from our body with that right hand ready to backstop that pass. Again, here's the shot. Good extension of the shooting arm and elbow. Begins to snap the wrist down. Guide hand here on the side, not bad. Again, though, he just falls forward here trying to push the ball to the basket. We need more legs initially so we don't have to fall forward. You know, he might recommend him moving in here closer and shooting where he doesn't really just work on form shooting and then maybe establish the left foot pivot and pull the right leg into the shot. and see his landing. He let the ball go, shot it, follow-through is a little too high, maybe get that elbow in, but the follow-through is really nice. But look how he lands with one leg right way out and foot, leg, all of the part of the lower body out in front of him. He lands kind of one-two, so begin all his weights forward, he's off-balance, kind of turned inward a little bit. We want to keep our hips square to the basket and ideally jump straight up and come straight down.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

While she's shimmying her shoulders, she's also able to stay on the rhythm with her footwork and stay fairly clear with her footwork, which shows that she's able to engage in polyrhythm. Again, a deeper bend in the knees, a dropping back of the pelvis to ground her movement would really be beneficial here, as well as some increased attention to dynamics, particularly in the motion of her arms. As the dancer begins with a basic salsa step, moving her one foot out from underneath her, moving it back into the middle, and then alternating sides, she demonstrates that she has a fairly clear understanding of the movement vocabulary here. She's engaging her arms in a way that could use a little bit of refinement, but it was overall appropriate for the movement style, and is able to stay connected to the rhythm and tempo of the music through her footwork. However, she would benefit from bending her knees more deeply and dropping that pelvis back so she could increase her range of motion, particularly in her pelvis, and more deeply embody the rhythm as well as enhance her movement dynamics. As the dancer performs this turn around herself, she's able to spot her head, though she could use a little bit more refinement in the spotting so that she's able to move more quickly through the space, which would help her to connect to the rhythm more deeply. She also has a nice positioning, particularly of her right arm, however her left arm is a little bit crunched over her head. If she were to elongate that arm through the elbow, she would have a cleaner line in her body shape, as well as be able to move a bit more quickly through the space. As the dancer performs a basic salsa step moving forwards and backwards within the space, she continues to stay fairly connected to the rhythm and tempo of the music through her footwork and has added a little bit of refinement to her arms and her choreographic approach to her upper body, which has helped her to simplify her movement and stay a bit more connected to the rhythm. However, again, she really would benefit from grounding into her movement, bending those knees, dropping that pelvis back, and engaging her upper body in a looser, more natural way that would be fitting for the movement vocabulary.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You'll notice that the climber is using the inside foot, so the right foot to hand foot match here while driving on this left foot down here. Interesting start position, just a little weird from a technical perspective, but I think that this is a cool method for starting this boulder. And as the climber initiates the move, they just waver a bit. Try and make them come off of the right hand jug, start initiating the movement, and then kind of back off a little bit. They most likely didn't feel very comfortable on the heel. Also, this is a pretty stressful hold here. It looks not so good. And so, just a little bit of indecision from the climber, and they fall.

So on this view you see this right arm is held up here holding the follow-through and then she'll have her left guide hand holding it up here holding it until the ball goes through the basket or hits the rim. This way she can check and make sure that her left guide hand is remaining open with her palm facing to the direction of the right which is the release of her shooting hand and also making sure that her guide hand, the wrist on her guide hand isn't snapping down towards the basket on the release of the ball but holding that guide hand and that palm is nice and open facing towards her right shooting hand. And also by her holding her release she'll be able to see the release of the ball of her right shooting hand that her elbow is really low. On the next shot attempt she'll make sure that when she shoots the ball she holds the follow-through and make sure that the elbow is above her eye level. Correcting these two issues in her shot that left hand, her guide hand and on the release having her elbow be slightly above her eye level will increase her overall shooting percentage and she will make more shots. on the release of the ball you can see her right hand she is in the process of snapping her wrist her right hand allowing the ball to roll off her fingertips of her right hand however she also snaps the wrist of her left hand so it's rolling the ball rolled off the fingertips of both her left hand and her right hand on the release of the ball which means that this is a two hand shot and we do not want to shoot the ball with two hands we want to make sure that every shot is a one-handed shot a one-handed shot allows us to be more consistent in the placement of the ball and more consistent in making the ball go into the basket as we release the ball for our shot we take a look at her the placement of her feet you can see that her right foot is slightly this is like the heel of her right foot and this is the heel of her left foot so her right foot is slightly in front of her left foot which is good positioning as having her right foot in front allows for her elbow to be aligned with the front of the rim however you also notice her feet are really close together so as she bends down to load and gather strength from her legs to shoot the ball her knees are out over the front of her toes so in order this is putting a lot of stress on her knees and this is not the proper mechanics for her to maximize the strength that she gathers from her legs and also we don't wanna put any undue pressure on her knee joints and cause any type of wear and tear so in order to avoid her knees going out over her toes and placing all of that stress on her knees she should space her feet out wider having some space having her feet shoulder width apart is a a good place to start and then she can work from that position on what's most comfortable for her but having her feet this close together is really bad for her knees generating the proper force necessary up into the shooter's shooting motion we can't have her knees out over her toes like this You take a look at the placement of her elbow on the release of the ball. You can see the elbow is slightly below the eye level of the shooter's eyes. On this release, the elbow should be up just slightly above the eye level of the shooter. So when the ball is released and the elbow is up high, it will create that good arc on the ball and drop directly into the basket. However because of how low the shooter's elbow is, the trajectory of the ball is more of a straight line to the basket which makes it more difficult for the ball to go into the basket because the path of the ball to the basket is so flat. A lot of times when the shot is this flat, it's going to end up hitting the backboard first on the shot. If it doesn't hit the backboard first, it's going to either hit the front of the rim or hit the back of the rim. When it hits the back of the rim at such a flat angle, it lessens the percentage of the ball actually going into the basket. Let's take a look at the hand placement of her hands. Her right hand is underneath the ball, which lets you know that she's a right-handed shooter. However, her left hand, her guide hand, is to the left of the ball, but also behind, is slightly behind the ball. With the hands in this position, when she goes up to release the ball, it's going to be a natural motion for her to push the ball with both hands as she releases the ball. We need the hand, her left hand, her guide hand, placed more on the side of the ball. And she shoots this ball only with one hand. And her left hand, her guide hand, is only there to hold the ball in place so it's nice and set in her right hand. And when she releases the ball, it's supposed to be with one hand.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I would encourage the dancer to be more grounded and to really think about practicing the transitions between steps because it can feel a little awkward and stiff because they're not grounded and sometimes they're like a half a second off of the rhythm. And it's not because they don't know the steps, it's because of the fact of moving from one step to the next, there's not this consistent flow that allows you to continuously be on the music. So sometimes they're on the music and sometimes they're off. So practicing not just one step at a time, but the steps in continuation or the transitions between steps would help with the overall dynamic quality and flow of the movement. I would encourage the dancers to really think about embodying from head to toe, because they have really great kind of energy and swag happening in their head, but that doesn't reverberate to the rest of the body, so it can feel awkward at moments. I think it would be really great for this dancer to practice this dance without moving their arms. So really just take a couple of times to practice by just using your hips so it can be more grounded. You can feel the flow of the hips and then add the arms back to see how it should move in one cohesive piece. Because there's a lot of focus on the upper half of the body as opposed to the lower. So to stop that kind of Cartesian split or that difference from the top half to the bottom half, we have to focus on the bottom half and then reconnect it to the top. Here I repeat my previous comments about grounding but also using power throughout the arms. I would encourage the dancer again to think about their hip articulation so we have full embodiment.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As you see the ball is inside this portion, inside the outer portion of the square and the ball hit the top line of the square. So by her hitting the corner there was no need for any side spin on the ball. So as it hit that spot and it dropped nicely into the basket. After she makes the layup on the right side, she uses the proper footwork. As you see, she's in the process of stepping with her right foot for step one and then swing her left foot around for step two to square herself up to have a good position on the left side of the basket for this left-hand layup. However, she allowed the ball to fall through the basket and hit the ground. When we're doing Mike and Drew, the ball goes through the basket. We have to step with this right foot. Ideally, we would like it to be a bigger step and not such a small step. We'll take a big step to make sure that we get to the the best position on the floor on the left side to make the layup as easy as possible. But since she allowed, we don't want to allow the ball to drop down out of the basket and hit the floor because the Mike and Drew is also about having a good rhythm during the drill, having good placement of the ball on the backboard, and also of having the proper footwork to put yourself in the best possible position on the floor. So by her allowing the ball to hit the floor, that disrupts the rhythm of the Mike and Drew, which is an important factor in completing the drill at a high level. You see the ball, she does a good job of placing the ball nice and high on the backboard as it's slightly above the top portion of the square. You also see that the ball hits outside of the square. So since it hit outside of the square, we need to make sure that the ball has good side spin so it can spin off of the backboard and into the basket. On this shot attempt, she didn't put enough side spin on the ball. So it hit the backboard and then it hit the front of the rim and we missed the shot. After she makes the layup on the left side, she does a great job of catching the ball out of the basket and not allowing the ball to hit the ground. Now, although we would like for the ball to stay in her upper chest, neck area and not allow the ball to drop down to her waist area, but the fact that she actually caught the ball out of the net without letting the ball hit the floor, this allows her to catch the ball and step in rhythm to the opposite side of the basket and shoot the next layup. However, this time she uses the incorrect footwork. So although she catches the ball like she's supposed to, I don't know if you can hear she steps with her right foot. We want to take this first step with our left foot. So that left foot, where she's placing her right foot, that left foot will be here step one, and then swing the right foot around over in here to square herself up to the basket for step two. And then she'll have the proper angle to where she can go right off of the backboard aiming for this top right portion of the square. on the left side she again she hits at the level of the top left portion of the square so this shot has good height as you see it hits the backboard outside of the square so we'll need side spin with the ball spinning in this direction for the ball to hit the backboard and spin off of the backboard and into the basket this shot didn't have any side spin on it so it hit the the backboard and it came off and hit the front of the rim and we missed the shot short", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

However, the placement is really low as it's just barely above the top portion. It's barely above the bottom portion of the square. Since it was placed so low on the backboard, even though he did a good job of putting side spin on the ball, it spinned off of the backboard and hit the front rim. And we missed the shot because the placement of the ball was too low. So when we're placing the ball outside of the square, we need to have the ball up higher near the top portion of the square. So when it spins off of the backboard, it can fall down, spin to the left and over the right side of the rim. And it can drop down into the basket before it hits this portion of the rim. looking at the placement of the ball on the backboard you see it hits the backboard slightly outside of the square and it's also near the top portion of the square on the backboard you can also see from this angle here is near the top portion the square on the backboard so since it's outside of the square we need to make sure that the ball has a side spin on it so once it spins off of the backboard it can go directly into the basket on this shot attempt the player did a good job of putting the proper amount of side spin on the ball so that it spin off the backboard and went into the basket The player here shows the correct footwork for doing a right hand reverse layup. When we're jumping off of one foot, when we're doing a right hand reverse layup, we're coming from the left side of the floor to the right side of the floor. We're jumping off one foot, we want to make sure that we jump off of our left foot. And the player here does a good job of making sure that he jumps off of his left foot. We also want to release the ball at the highest point of our jump. In order to reach the highest point of our jump, we have to make sure that when we jump that we lift the right knee up to our waist level as we're exploding up into the air from the ground. So by not getting his knee up to his waist level as he's exploding off of the ground, off his left foot with the jump from the ground up into the air, this means that he is not reaching the highest point of his jump. And so he's not, since we're not releasing the ball at the highest point of our jump, that means we're not getting the full benefits of this right hand reverse layup drill. looking at the placement of this ball on the backboard here it hit the the right side of the square on the backboard. You see it's above the top portion of the square the bottom portion of the square but it's slightly below the top portion of the square so it hits near the midpoint of the square the line here so from this position here we just need a slight amount of side spin for it to hit off of the backboard here and go into the basket and the player did a good job of making sure that the ball had the correct amount of side spin so it went off of the backboard and directly into the basket The player does a good job of extending his right hand and releasing the ball when his hand is fully extended. When his hand is fully extended and the ball is high and away from his body. So this is a good release point for the ball. He also, as you see, has his left arm up. Ideally we would like for his arm to be up a little bit higher. By having his arm up higher, it protects the ball as he's releasing the ball. It protects it from the defense who is coming to contest the shot on the side of his left shoulder. So by having that arm up, the defense will have to make contact with his left arm as he's releasing the ball. While the defense is making contact with his left arm, that will either be a foul that the referees will call, or if the referee doesn't call the foul, it still slows the defense down long enough to where he can release the ball from his right hand before the defense has an opportunity to block or contest his shot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Very little use of the lower body and that non-shooting hand just kind of hangs down by the side. He lets the ball come out, lets it drop down. Ideally, we want to keep it up high. Every time you bring the ball down low, unless you're dribbling around, you know, you have the potential to have it stripped out of your hand. His feet are together. We prefer here stepping on that left foot and really driving that right hip up. He does a nice job of kind of looking up. Again, see how far under he is? I mean, and again, if this is a miss, it's tough to rebound when you're standing under the basket. He needs to be out in here a little bit. He's looking straight up to the bottom of the net. Again, doesn't even move. I mean, he just basically just stands under the basket to shoot this shot. And ideally the execution of this drill involves the footwork, it involves rebounding and the movement from side to side with a layup using the correct hand. Again, you know, doesn't even attempt to hold it with two hands and take it up there. He's just hooking it up or lifting, if you will, underneath the basket. And he's having to like really take it out wide. And again, it just throws off the accuracy of the ball going in. Again, this needs to break down the footwork. Without the basketball, without even shooting, you just work on the footwork, stepping through right, lifting the left, stepping through left, pulling up the right knee, then add the ball, then add the shot. That's the progression of this drill. Same thing on the left, just standing straight up under underneath the net and just trying to lift and hook it up. See the hook shot? He just kind of winds up, sorry, winds up and really shoots it out way from his body. Ideally you want to square your body and shoot in front of that right chest. No guide hand. Again, very little ball control here. Here the shooter is shooting a right-handed layup. He really chooses just to stand under the net and shoot without the use of his non-shooting hand, just to kind of hook it up with his right arm and hand. Not bad lift or elevation here. Good extension here of the shooting arm. But see how he's standing under the basket. Not a really good angle to get your body square and faced up to the basket. Again, standing underneath the basket, straight up, feet are together. When he shoots his left shot, I really want him to step through with that right foot and really lift that left leg. Keep two hands on the ball as you prepare to shoot it. Again, not using any sort of footwork, and ideally for the execution of this drill, we want to see a right-left takeoff, left-right takeoff, etc. from side to side. Here he just leans, puts that ball in the shooting hand here, he brings it down really low, and so he's got a long ways to take this ball up. And standing under the basket is no easy task. Again, see all shooting hand only. There's no two hands to help lift it up. Again, this is his view. You don't wanna get caught under the basket. You wanna be out from the basket. And the reason so is the game is played out, you know, out from the rim. Shots hit and pop out. They don't go under unless it goes in the basket. He gets the rebound and just continues to stand under the basket. Tough angle to use that glass in performing and executing this Mike-in drill. You know, he would benefit from just, you know, working on the footwork, moving from right to left side, along with the shooting, which could come later. He's just choosing to stand under the basket and go off two feet. And just, he kind of sits that ball, whatever hand he's shooting with, is just sitting on the palm of his hand, and he lifts it up or hooks it up. Not a lot of control or balance here.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I love that he brings two hands on the ball as he transitions from side, right side to the left side. I would love to see more of a step through here, but this is okay because he's not traveling and he's choosing to power it up off two feet. Again, we'd love to see more lift, bounce, elevation here, but again, he's got great size and strength, good follow through. You can see the snapping of the wrist here. Again, bending of the knees, would love to see a little bit more lift and explosion, but chooses to go off two feet. Vertical, eyes and head up. Great use of the arm bar here. Comes down cushioned, snapping of the wrist, you can see the fingers going down, the balls aiming for the top of that square on the backboard. Again, he's gathering, knees are bending, going to go off two feet, great use of the off-hand or arm bar, eyes and head are up, getting to a place where he can use that square on the backboard. Beautiful takeoff of two feet. You know, this is okay, especially for a guy with his strength and size. You know, a lot of people would teach the footwork of going off the right and lifting the left knee, but you know, on this drill, he's choosing to power it up off two feet, which is a very strong and aggressive type movement. I would love to see maybe a little more lift and push here, but great use of the shooting hand and arm, arm bars up 90 degree. Beautiful look here of the follow-through, all five fingers, four fingers and thumb are spread across the ball. The ball's in a great space here of moving toward the backboard for the bake. Again, step through, power it up. We'd love to see a little more, maybe a little more bounce, a little more explosion here, but overall, very, very good. Great use of the arm bar. Again, the reason we want this arm up here, if there's a defender wanting to get to the ball, he's going to have to come across the shooter's body to try to block it and maybe potentially foul the shooter. Again, he's got a lot of height and size and strength, choosing to go off two feet, which is okay. Love this use of the arm bar, the right non-shooting hand and arm. Great extension here of the left arm as he lifts it toward the basket. Better job of keeping the ball up high as he transitions from right to left side, steps through with that right foot, pulling the left leg behind, the arm bars up to help guide it to this place of release. Did a great job moving from right to left with keeping the ball up high. I mean, it's hard for someone to get that. I mean, he's not bringing it down to waist level. And look at this stepping with the right foot, pulling that left leg up behind. Great use of the arm bar to guide and protect the basketball. Here the participant is shooting a right hand layup. It's fine that he's going off two feet. I call this a power layup. Love the verticality here. He's straight up. Great use of the non-shooting arm or the guide hand or the, I call it the arm bar. And great eyes on target, great extension of the right arm into the shot. Again, look how he squares his body to the basket. He lays that ball high on the backboard. He keeps his eye on his target by keeping his head and eyes up. Again, love how he squares his body to the basket. That means both shoulders, hips are facing the basket. And you can see how he uses that right foot, the left foot comes in to help square the body, face the basket, and then extend that shooting arm up. Again, check out the follow-through. Very well done. Again, great bends the knees when he lands, arm bar stays up, follow through, eyes and head on target. The ball's in a great position to drop in off the backboard into the net. Would love for the participant in the ideally in the Mike and drill, we teach it to keep the ball up really high here. He lets it drop down to his knees. So being 6'8\", he makes himself 5'7\". Little defenders here could strip that little guard. So let's, as a post player, let's keep that ball up shoulder level. Actually keep those arms up as he moves from side to side.

We can lose our balance or the ball can, we can lose control of the ball. And that's how we're turning, that's how we may turn the ball over or as we're getting ready to jump. Since we don't have full control of the ball, because the defender bumped us a little bit. We can lose control of the ball as we shoot the ball off of the backboard and we end up missing that shot, all because we put the ball into one hand too soon. Now there's situations where it is okay for us to put the ball in, there's one hand early like this. And that's in a situation where we're driving to the basket and there's nobody around. So we're not worried about the defense bumping us or of us losing control of the ball.

The follow-through is good, the angle's good, but I would love to see him square this right shoulder and kind of shoot the ball a little bit more out in front of him where he can protect it. He's a little, has a long distance for this ball to travel when you bring it up around your right shoulder. Here's the takeoff. Again, let's really push up and get our body up more in terms of the lift. So we need a nice big step and a push off to draw this right knee up to get our body up. I feel like he could probably do that a little bit better. And he's definitely going to be more effective and it's definitely going to be more game-like. Again, shoots a little bit over that right shoulder. Let's bring that right shoulder in, pivot a little bit more on our left foot to get our body facing the backboard. And you can kind of see how he's got to wind it up here to shoot it. Let's shoot it more out in front of your body. Here the shooter's shooting a reverse right hand layup, going off the correct left foot, pulling the right knee up, his eyes and head are on target. He brings it up off the dribble, has two hands on it, his shooting hand, his right hand, and his left hand, his guide hand. Here's the take off on the left foot. Nice job there getting ready to pull that right knee up. Again he's being strong with it keeping two hands on it but let's get it up here a little bit quicker. Eyes and head are up. Nice job there. We'd love to see a real strong power dribble and bigger steps to the basket here. He takes really little steps. His feet are together. Let's spread them apart and really go somewhere with this dribble. His eyes and head are up. He's doing a good job of keeping two hands the ball as he picks the ball up off the dribble. We'd love to see the shooter really, really push off a lot harder with that left foot. Maybe even take a bigger, stronger step on that left foot to get elevation and height to push this right knee up. He does a great job of getting good spacing here in the angle to use the backboard. His eyes and head are up.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They could just practice very slowly and be very attentive to their fingers to make sure that they're very close and that every single note speaks. The guitarist is using their thumb to strum through all the strings. If they wanted to have a little bit more volume, they could add maybe a little bit more arm movement to help them get through. All the notes that they just tried to play is a bit unclear. The tempo that they're taking for this piece might be a bit fast for them. It'd be good for them just to overall practice it very slowly and then build it up over time so that they feel very coordinated. Again, another shift. It's also very clean and the timing between the right hand is very good. To get this short articulation, the guitarist is strumming the strings with their right hand and then quickly blocking the string so it sounds very short. The guitarist is getting around really well during this section and they have a lot more clarity. They're helping use the rotation aspect of their wrist to have more efficient movement and make it easier on their left hand. Here the notes don't sound very clearly because of an uncoordination between the right hand and the left hand. The guitarist should make sure that they have their fingers down where they need to and then strum the right strings. The guitarist is using the tuning peg to tune their guitar. The guitarist is using the tuning peg to tune the guitar. The guitarist is playing these chords with the right hand, kind of using a pinching motion. The balance between the strings is really nice and very even. The guitarist can have more anticipation of the notes that they're about to play. This second finger they're about to play but it's up in the air. They can have it down when this finger is down and that would help their coordination. The left hand starts to become a little bit unclear here. They can make sure that their left hand is being as efficient as possible, but just make sure that they practice very slowly so that they can grab every single one of those notes. The guitarist is using their right hand to play some harmonics. They're lightly touching with their first finger and then strumming with these other fingers. Some of the notes sound very clear, some others not so much. They make sure that they have good coordination, that when they pluck with their right finger that they also quickly come out of the string so it can ring. The guitarist is making good use of having their fingers into the string, they're using their fingertips. This is giving them a lot of clarity for their sound. The time taken at the very end of this piece is very nice and very musical. The guitarist has a really beautiful hand shape here that they're using curved fingers, but you can see also between all of their fingers there's this nice equal spacing. They also have it really well set up with the angle of their arm. Here it sounds like the guitarist is starting to rush a little bit. I can make sure that they feel very grounded in the bigger beats and thinking about spending a little bit more time on each of the chords and the singular notes. The guitarist is doing a really excellent job of highlighting the top melodic line while all this other intricate bass work is going on. The guitar shifts up the fretboard. The guitarist has a really playful tempo here and they're doing a really nice job of covering all the ground on the fretboard. I think they're using their arm very efficiently to help their hand get to where it needs to be. The guitarist has a really nice touch in their right hand, the balance between their thumb strumming and also their fingers is really nice. It's very pleasant to listen to. The guitarist has really great coordination in the right hand, making sure that they're strumming all the right notes. This section comes across as very musical and very pleasant to listen to. The clarity and the coordination needs to be improved in the left hand. Because of their third finger being so straight, they're taking up a lot of space, which is resulting in their pinky having a hard time finding those notes. If they can play more with the fingertip, the third finger, and have a more curved hand, it'll be easier for the pinky to get in and play those notes. The guitarist plays a very soft chord. They played a little bit further up with their contact point, so it came across as very smooth and light. The guitarist uses their right hand thumb to strum down through the strings to get a nice big chordal sound.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The dancer should also bend his knees further here in order to make the dance step larger and more energetic. This is the same comment I made before in regards to him dancing flat-footed. He's still dancing flat-footed, but it's especially important when he's turning that he doesn't dance flat-footed and lifts his heels off the ground because dancing with your heels on the ground while you're turning creates friction and slows down the turn and risks you not completing the turn completely in the amount of time that is designated because the heels being on the floor slows it down. Once again, the dancer's arm that's in the air is a little too low. It only is slightly above a parallel line to the floor. It is on a diagonal, but the angle is subtle. It's a small acute angle. He should raise his arm higher so that it is a larger diagonal. The dancer is bending far over in order to reach his hand to his ankle here as we see his shoulders are on a diagonal leaning downward. The dancer should also lift his right arm here higher so that it's on a clear diagonal. It's only slightly above a straight line that would be parallel to the floor, so he needs to raise that arm even higher. The dancer is doing these basic salsa steps forward and backwards on flat feet, meaning his entire foot is on the ground, both on his right foot and his left foot. The dancer's right arm here is a bit too far back. It's behind his head and he needs to bring his arm a little bit more forward in front of him so that his shoulder blade doesn't open towards the back. The dancer's legs aren't as wide and the second time he does the side dance step this time to the right side it's smaller than compared to when he did it a couple of seconds ago to his left side so his legs should be as wide apart each time so here he can afford to move his legs wider. Instead, to make his weight shift easier as he's going forwards and backwards, changing direction, he should put his weight on his toes and lift his heels off the ground so that he would be more mobile.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The climber did get to achieve tapping the hold above but the small adjustment of knowing how the knee is going to be extended or how the climber would put pressure on the toe is important so the climber has an easier time on driving the weight on this once the climber gets to sprint up. Here we can see the climber rocking while the arms are being extended and creating momentum while pendling over left to right and also while standing on the feet, creating pressure. This will help the climber to balance the weight from one foot to the other as the arms are extended. The climber needs to create force in order to go up for the dynamic move. He makes himself really low and squatting down so as soon as the climber is able to have the explosive move for the dyno, then the climber first will start by trying to bring his body close to the right foot that's positioned the highest and push down hard with the left foot. Once the climber stands on the right foot, the left foot would potentially leave the wall and the climber will have to forcefully push on the right foot after the climber achieves leverage. Here we can see the climber chucking up the hands. This will help the climber to gain a better grip when on the wall. Also will help the climbers absorb any sweat that may be coming from the hands. Here the climber gets to walk out the right foot last and letting all of the limbs go out on the direction where the climber needs it to be in order to go with the momentum of the swing out as the climber reaches out with the right hand. Here we can see the climber starting at the position where a two hand hold start. Now each of the hands are holding on to a donut where the climber is gripping with fully on a pinch. This one on each hand being in a pinch and the climber staying down below.

He also continues to engage his arms and his upper body in the choreography, which makes the choreography more interesting and complex, and is able to stay on rhythm and embody the rhythm. As the dancer performs this body roll, it demonstrates that he is a little bit stiff in his movements, or a little bit awkward, particularly down the spine and to the pelvis. He really doesn't have much mobility in his pelvis at all, and only some slight mobility in his upper body in general. He would just benefit from really bending those knees a little bit more significantly, and really loosening up the movement in the pelvis to allow for a greater range of motion. The dancer starts with a basic salsa step. He has his arms engaged in a meaningful way. He's able to maintain the tempo and the rhythm in his feet and overall shows he understands the movement vocabulary here. What would heighten his performance is more flexibility in the pelvis, more engagement of the pelvis in general, which would demand a slight bend in the knees, which would take his performance dynamics to the next level. The dancer moves through a series of different movements quite quickly, which demonstrates that he has an understanding of the technique and has really embodied the choreography and memorized it both in his mind and in his body. However, overall his performance really lacks any sort of specific movement dynamics. It's all very one note and it feels very quick and sharp. He would benefit from paying more attention to his movement dynamics, softening in some moments and really finding ways to play with the polyrhythm of the music. And embodying that rhythm a little bit more deeply. As the dancer switches to some more advanced choreography, performing this jump over to the side, he starts to lose the rhythmic embodiment he started with in the beginning. He would benefit from some more clarity in the choreography here, perhaps just some extra rehearsal, as well as having a deeper connection to the rhythm.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So here she steps forward and back. She is stepping out with those knees bent and the heels off the floor as well as a really nice rotation in her arms and shoulders. So overall, this was really great, really great example. She just looked, you know, performance ready, nice transition through the steps and great energy throughout. So here's a bit of a freestyle, so really nice play on the music and the style of dance. So here the dancer starts taking just some two steps side to side and she kind of throws her arms to the side and what makes it special is she adds a little like oomph to the to the swing so it's not just swinging them and step but she adds a little extra shoulder shrug to it so again just adding that extra detail makes it look a lot better. She's also kind of pushing out her hips as she steps out to the side so again adding another detail to the movement. So here, I think is my only comment just for correction. I would definitely bend this right knee so that way you can extend this left leg out a little bit more. But otherwise, really nice job with the arm out and then kind of holding for a second into that pose. So here on both turns, nice job getting all the way around, getting the arms extended up over the head, and just keeping everything nice and smooth and light. So here she's just taking three steps across side to side. Nice job there. The arm is extended out and stretching around as she walks.

She also drizzles a little bit more oil around the outside of the omelet. This is so that she can ensure that the edges don't stick. As you can see here, her pan is very hot and smoking, so she does want to adjust the temperature down so that her egg doesn't overcook immediately. Then using the side of a spoon, she cracks the eggshell lightly. This could have been done on the edge of the mixing bowl here or on the countertop as well. And using a flat metal spatula, which is the appropriate tool selection for this task, she edges along the outside of the entire omelet to ensure that it is not sticking. She uses the metal spoon to spread out the ingredients into a thin even layer. And you can see that it immediately begins to bubble up, which is the sign that the pan is possibly overheated prior to adding the omelet. In this scenario, I probably just would have started preheating it earlier, I'm sorry, later than when she did at the first step of the recipe. She also seasons with about a half of a teaspoon, I'm sorry, a fourth of a teaspoon of salt. She taps the omelet down lightly to make sure that it's all even.

Looking at the player going into his right-handed reverse layup attempt on the right frame, some improvements the player can make to avoid having a potential turnover in a game-like scenario is to bring his ball placement position above his shoulder to not allow defenders to have easy access of stripping, taking, or stealing the ball while going into his layup attempt.

As you can see, his knee is really low, which lets you know that he's not putting in the full effort into it by attempting to jump and release the ball at his highest point. In order for this to be the perfect Mike in drill, he really needs to explode and jump as high as he can on each jump as he releases the ball. Also, you can see here the ball is in his left hand and is extended high above his head and away from his body, away from his frame. If the defense is on his right side, they're not going to be able to come across his body and contest that shot because he has it so far away from his body to the left. This is a real good extension of the ball away from his body. As he catches the ball out of the net, you see he drops the ball down to his waist level. Ideally, when we're doing the Mike and drill, after we catch the ball out of the net, we want to keep the ball high around our shoulder, neck area to keep the ball up high so we're in a strong position as we take that step to go up and finish the layup on the opposite side of the basket. He places the ball slightly outside of the square. It's slightly below the top of the square. That's pretty good placement, but as it's outside of the square, you need to make sure that the ball has good side spin so it can spin off the backboard and into the basket. The player did a good job of putting good side spin on this layup attempt. It was able to spin off of the backboard and into the basket. As we see on this attempt, the ball hits the backboard outside of the square. It also has good height as it's pretty much on the line of the top of the square. As it hits the backboard this far away from the square, we're going to need a lot of side spin in this direction for the ball to spin off of the backboard and go into the basket. This player is right-handed and on this attempt he uses his left hand. So this is good usage of the side spin with your weaker hand, his left hand, and he was able to spin it this far away from the square and into the basket. Here the player shows the proper footwork as he's coming for the left hand layup. On the left side of the basket during the Mike and Drew, he makes sure to step with his right foot and he jumps off his right foot to complete the layup with his left hand.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And it just seems like maybe they could have crossed up and right off of the start, or maybe there's a way to match this hold that doesn't seem so crowded. It's hard to say. So here we have a dual start for the hands. Left hand down pulling on an edge, right hand pinching this brick. Palmer also has a pretty decent foot for the right foot and I believe is pasting the left foot a little bit lower on a slightly worse foot. And the climber just gets stuck. This doesn't seem to be the correct beta, so the climber backs off and hopefully we'll get to try something else. Climber then goes up left hand to this shallow Waco pocket situation here. Looks like a decent hold, but Climber is right now attempting to match this hold. And I think that this is going to be a pretty difficult match.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

You can see the bottom pinky here have the most weight, and then she transfers the weight over to the other side of the hand. This is a really good piano technique to alleviate stress in the fingers. lovely subito dynamics here to show the bouncy rhythm in the first section and then the unison all of a sudden right in the middle of the keyboard. Really nice rubato here. There's moments where she's playing through the phrase and there's a moment of dissonance or Resolution in the chords and she brings the listeners attention to it This is a sign of a good musician who knows how to follow lines of music You can really see that weight happening here in the wrist. Really excellent use of weight transfer. Rushing slightly here. big rush there at the end. It might be written in the actual music, but it didn't feel very measured. It just felt not purposeful. Solid tempo throughout. Positioning looks pretty good. Elbows come down at an angle towards the keys instead of from above. I lost a little bit of the tempo there with that subito. I think she just rushed. Another great example of the tail end of that phrase, just getting a nice little cherry on top with the tempo. Really excellent phrasing. I quite like the weight of the keys in the left hand that stays pretty consistent, but then grows with the phrase that she's making with her right hand.

I would encourage the dancer to be more grounded so they can have more hip articulation. I would encourage the dancer to have more power throughout their arms through the entire dance. They're kind of flowing, but it's not flowing with an intention. This is another moment where the dancer definitely needs more power behind their movement throughout this whole phrase so it can be really dynamic and striking and direct so we stay engaged in this advance also. I would encourage the dancer to really think about the musicality from their finger tips all the way to the soles of their feet and making sure that everything is moving together in tandem. Even if you're holding multiple polyrhythms in the body, it's still important to make sure that all of the different rhythms you're holding in your body are flowing together.

She played each note with a really nice weight and emphasis that really brought out the melodic contour that sounded really beautiful. The sustained warm tone that she's getting as she moves her hands up and down the keyboard is really smooth and connected and sounds really beautiful. She's able to get this by, you know, holding on to the keys just long enough so that it sounds until she gets to the next key. And that consistent, even warm sound is really beautiful and really impressive. This last chord that she played kind of had like a rolled quality like that C sharp there and then her hand moved over there. I think that might be something that was written in Rachmaninoff, who is the composer of this piece. He liked to write pieces with a really big span of hands, so like you have to reach really far to reach some of the notes in this and I think maybe she had to roll that one just so her hand could reach that note. This is what a lot of pianists have to do because Rachmaninoff is very difficult and again has that really wide range that your hand has to stretch. She's demonstrating a lot of good musical phrasing because in music you don't want to play every single note the same. You want there to be some variety and you want to draw attention to certain notes. And she's not playing every note exactly the same but rather she's growing and she's kind of decreasing speed or decreasing volume as she finishes phrases. And that give-and-take is very musical and she's doing that really well. I think that she went back a little bit during this part. I think she went back to go fix something. This last section, the last few seconds that she played, you could tell that her tempo wasn't especially steady and she kind of lost a little bit of that drive of the direction of the melody. I think because she was just negotiating and trying to find her hand position and it wasn't quite as expressive sounding as it could have been because I think she wasn't as comfortable with the hand positions and just the fingerings of that particular section. You can hear her start to apply more weight onto the keyboard in this last part as the phrase is growing, and it's nice to hear that crescendo. I still would like to hear her use even more weight and more confidence in these very climactic moments of the music. She just played an incorrect note, I believe it was either like a C or a C sharp here with her right pinky. So there was an, I think her finger just didn't get to the right placement in the right time as she was shifting her hand up to the next position on the keyboard. However, this small mistake did not stop her. She continued to play and the musical line kept going. The last arpeggio that she played I believe had a wrong note like right there and there's a bit of hesitation as she went into that next arpeggio but she's continuing to go despite you know making a small error there. As she was moving her right hand to a new hand position, she accidentally played this G sharp here, so she had one missed note, but it didn't fluster her or anything, she just kept going with both of her hands, and it was a very small mistake that is kind of hard to notice. She's playing the melody in both hands with just one finger, but she's matching both hands very well. Both hands blend together really well. She's applying the same amount of weight with both of her fingers, so both hands are just blending together really nicely, really drawing attention to that beautiful melody. She sort of hesitated to find her next note. I think that what happened was she was looking at the music and then lost track of where her hand was so she kind of took her a second to recover from that mistake and she but she continued to play even though she kind of lost where she was for a second. She really brought out this bass note right here and she gave a nice heavy accent to it with a lot of weight from her pinky. She really did an impressive job of playing a scale with both hands that went all the way up the keyboard. So she used both hands to play a scale pattern of the keyboard and both of her hands had an even amount of weight applied and each note was super connected and she also did a crescendo toward toward the end. So she started softer and got louder as she went up the keyboard. So this is very exciting to watch and very virtuosic. Nicely done. The last time that she played that melody, she gave it a lot of direction. So as each note went by, each note got a little bit louder, so it had a lot of good musical phrasing that she used. Each one of these notes with her right hand has a lot of clarity. It almost sounds like a bell and she's getting a really beautiful resonance from the sound by applying a nice amount of weight with each finger but not too much. You can also see that her hand sort of lifts off just a little bit from each note which makes each note have just a really beautiful ringing sound which sounds really nice. You can hear that she slowed down just a little bit toward the end of what she just played. In piano that's, or in music in general, that's what's called rubato, which is means just robbed time, and so she slowed down a little bit to emphasize the end of that musical phrase, and she did this really tastefully and really reflective of the Romantic style, which this is a piece of Romantic music, and she did that really beautifully. She just played a fast flurry of notes with both hands and octaves, and she did it with a really smooth and connected sound by making sure that her hands are placed in the right spot and her fingers are not pushing down the keys too hard. This sounded really smooth. So as you can see, she is using kind of a trill or lots of repeated notes that are very close together and they sound, and to rearticulate them, a lot of times pianists will use different fingers or different hands from different fingers to play the same note over and over but to be able to do it quicker than just one finger can do. So since she's using multiple fingers, she's able to make these repeated notes sound super clear because if you just use one finger and you repeat a note, you can't do it very quickly, but since she's using both of those fingers, it gets that repeated sound really, really crystal clear and she's doing that very well. Actually, I think that what she did was that she skipped ahead. I think there was a certain section of this music maybe she wasn't comfortable with, so she skipped ahead to another section. Because there is a bit of a change of mood between what she was just playing a second ago and now what she's playing. Now that she has this melody again, it sounds really beautiful and she's doing a good job of musical phrasing in that she is growing over time and that every every note doesn't sound the same, but there's a bit of crescendoing and a little bit of decrescendoing. The musical phrasing right here is very effectively used. Some of these left hand, her left hand arpeggios as she goes back and forth, some of these aren't sounding very clear. There's a, I think she might be leaving out a note or two or maybe there might be a certain note that she's playing incorrectly up and down, but she's not letting it stop her because the right hand is still playing this melody with her thumb and her pinky here and it's sounding very expressive. So she's kind of flubbing a little bit of her left hand notes, but she's not letting it too much in the way of the musical phrase and the musical direction. This particular section has a lot of chromatic notes or notes that are right next to each other, so like white key, then black key, then white key, and so on. As her hands are moving back and forth on the keyboard, there's a lot going on in both hands. She's doing her best to get every single note accurately, but she's not doing it especially musically or with a lot of phrasing. She's just really trying to make sure she gets all those notes and rhythms at the right timing and with the right pitches. She's doing a mostly accurate job, but it's starting to lose a little bit of speed and a little bit of that musicality, so this part could just use a little bit more practice. Now you can tell that she's reaching the end of something dramatic because she's in the lower part of the keyboard with both of these hands and she's using a lot of weight to get a really strong loud sound that is drawing a lot of attention to this part of the music. Her right hand is doing an exceptional job of being smooth and connected as she's playing these four notes. They're all very connected and very smooth sounding and she's doing that by applying an even amount of weight across all of her fingers. It sounds very smooth. Now she's starting to bring out this melody in octaves with her right hand as the left hand is going up and down the keyboard. This sounds really smooth and she's bringing out that right hand really well so you can hear that melody very well over all the different notes and that is very expressive of her. You can see that she's keeping her fingers held down in the left hand here to let these two bass notes really sustain and she's keeping her fingers pressed down on the keyboard to keep the sound going as long as you possibly can. With piano you can only press a note once and then it just sustains but she's keeping her fingers down to kind of keep that sound moving is written in the music. In order to execute these quick notes, her left hand is playing notes that are in the middle of what her right hand is doing. So like her right hand fingers are playing some notes and her left hand is playing some faster notes kind of in the middle of there. So she's able to play a lot of notes that are close together in rapid succession by using both of her hands. this transition to this next stormy part of the music wasn't especially clear. I think she maybe could have emphasized the transitional notes a little bit more or maybe even just taken a split second longer to get into this next section. The piano player is getting a really nice warm sound from the piano and you can see that her fingers are very curved and relaxed and they get just the right amount of weight for the kind of style of music that she's playing. There's not a ton of weight right now, it's pretty gentle soft and connected sound. Her right pinky played an incorrect note either like right here or right here. It was a very small mistake. There's a lot of notes, but I think there was one that just sounded a little bit off, but she kept going. One thing that she just did is that her left hand moved over here and her right hand is, she basically replaced her right hand with her left hand and she did it very seamlessly by moving this hand while some of the right hand was still playing some of the notes and then her left hand kind of replaced the right hand playing those same notes but she did it very seamlessly, you couldn't really hear a gap in the sound so that was very well executed, the changing of hands and now her right hand is now free to play something else afterward. Her left hand is now playing shorter notes as her right hand continues to play a lot of different fast notes that are right next to each other, but the shorter notes she's able to do by pushing down on the keys very shortly and then bringing it back up and that's creating a different sound and kind of giving the music a little bit more forward motion and contrast. She sort of slowed down a little bit toward the end of that phrase, I think just trying to find her next note with the hand position. I think that in this section she could use more weight and more velocity into the keys to get a more dramatic effect for the for this sort of more climactic sounding part of the music. I think that she is not quite playing with her full power and weight of her hands and I think that would help make this part be more effective. This part of the music has a very sad and somber mood and she's executing this really well by just having a really gentle touch with their right hand as she plays these arpeggio notes. And again she's bringing out the melody in those notes, highlighting certain notes, drawing certain attention to certain notes that have a certain kind of emotional impact. She played some octaves here with this D sharp here and that D sharp there, same with her other hand as well. And she played these octaves very cleanly with a very clear sound with a nice even amount of weight with the fingers. Her right hand crossed over her left hand as this fast flurry of notes continues, and she did this without much of a break in sound. The notes are still very sounding connected and smooth, and being able to cross over hands like this demonstrates a lot of skill and finesse on the keyboard. She made a hand position change with her left hand right here, and she did that with a lot of ease and accuracy. She got from one part of the keyboard to the other very easily. So some of the notes like this C here or this C sharp that she's playing with her right pinky have a really clear ringing sound to them, kind of ringing like a bell, and she's doing that by giving her pinky a little bit more weight and a little bit more release after she presses down the note, giving a lot more emphasis to that that high melodic note which sounds really beautiful.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here you can see that he has added a little bit of whole milk to his tea mixture. This is part of the recipe. It could be added in the beginning or here as the tea leaves are steeping. I would have liked to see him use a measuring spoon so he knew exactly how much milk he was adding to his recipe in order to make sure it was going to fit in his serving mug. However, he seems to have a good working knowledge of this recipe and probably knows exactly how much to eyeball put in. Again, the amount of sweetener, type of sweetener, or if you use sweetener at all in your milk tea is a personal preference. Alternately, you could use a liquid measuring cup and put about 8 ounces of liquid into your saucepan. Additionally, I like that he keeps a clean workspace. So right after he uses the milk, he goes to put it back in the fridge. There's no reason to leave your countertop dirty or unorganized when producing a recipe. Once simmering, you can see that he cuts his heat down to low. He doesn't want to completely boil the tea mixture over the side of the pot. He wants to allow it to continually heat for a longer period of time, typically three to five minutes for this particular recipe. Stirring the tea leaves or swirling the pan, either of those steps is appropriate for steeping the tea. That allows the tea leaves to move about the hot water and extract as much flavor as possible. To begin this recipe, he gathers his equipment first, and he is going to put a saucepan over his gas eye on a medium heat level. Once the tea leaves are strained out, they will be discarded and you can just enjoy the milk and the tea mixture in this recipe. As you can audibly hear the water coming to a boil, he adds his black tea leaves, a tablespoon of black tea leaves. This is an appropriate measurement for this amount of water. I would have liked to see him add the tea earlier before the water came to a boil because then it gives it more opportunity to steep. Step two is adding his sweetener. This could be done prior to or after adding your tea leaves to this mixture. Those are interchangeable. He is adding either a half of a teaspoon or a teaspoon of white granulated sugar. Another substitute could be brown sugar, honey, maple syrup, simple syrup, or a sugar substitute like stevia. Next, he measures the water that he's going to use for his milk tea directly into the serving mug that he plans to use.

She could really benefit from clearer transitions, more specific movements, and staying connected to the rhythm and heightening that attention to movement dynamic. As we near the end of this performance, the dancer is clearly lacking stamina. She's running out of energy, her movement isn't nearly as dynamic as it was at the beginning of this performance, and she's struggling with a lot of different transitional steps, not really falling into anything that's too repetitive, which is not helping her in this instance. She appears a little bit confused, not making any clear shapes with the body, and overall is just lacking that energy that she had prior. As the dancer makes much more of a larger kick out to the side of her here, she could benefit from a better posture happening through the arms and the legs and particularly the torso. You can see that this leg straightens but doesn't fully straighten at the knee. She could really benefit from straightening at that knee more and also creating a more definitive shape with the foot. It's kind of in between flexed and pointed. If you were to really strongly flex or really strongly point that foot it would benefit her. Her other supporting leg is also in a bit of an awkward position. It's turned in slightly with the foot turned out which is creating this awkward line of energy between the two feet where she's not able to support the kick as well as she might have if she were to turn this other leg out and bend that knee more deeply. However, her arm choreography here is good. It's very clear, it's very strong, but her torso is twisting in a bit of an awkward way which doesn't really support this kick. If she were to align her torso a bit more clearly where her shoulders are on top of her hips, she would open up range of movement in this kicking leg allowing her to kick much higher than she is right now. As the dancer is performing a pivot around herself with her arms kind of reaching out to the side, she could benefit from some clarity in this arm shape. Her arms are quite unclear, they have a slight bend to them, but not too much of a purposeful bend, and they're a little bit disconnected from the rhythm here as well. Overall some clarity in the shape of her upper body would really be beneficial. As the dancer is performing a number of different steps, not really creating any sort of repetitive pattern, she has moments where she appears a bit unsure in these transitions, moving very small and disconnected from the rhythm. However, she finds the rhythm pretty quickly in these moments and is able to bounce back pretty quickly, particularly through her use of arms and arm choreography. She has some really strong arm patterns here where they're reaching up above her and carving out to the side of her in this way that takes up a lot of space within her kinesphere and helps her connect to the rhythm and appear more confident throughout. Here the dancer is creating a really strong shape and alignment with the rhythm. She hits this shape perfectly on time with the rhythm and the music and she has these really strong clear hands with these nice strong arms in general. Her shoulder is twisting on top of her lower body in a way that's very flattering to this shape. Her leg is pointed out to the side with a nice clearly beveled foot bending nicely in the supporting leg and overall creating just a dynamic shape that's really in alignment with the music. She appears very strong and energetic here. This transitional step where the dancer is wiping her hands out in front of her as if she's like cleaning something in front of her with the palms of her hands and moving backwards into this space is quite awkward. She's not fully committing to this step. She appears to be starting a twist in her feet, her ankles, and her knees. However, she doesn't fully execute this twist. She could bend her knees much more significantly and move her arms with more energy and more distinct movement quality in front of her. Overall, it looks like she's marking this step slightly, not executing it fully. Heightened energy, more specific movement, and more direct movement of the limbs would really benefit her here. The dancer performs the arms much more strongly as she repeats this gliding step except moving forward diagonally in the space. You can see her arms have a much more specific shape and she's performing it with a lot more energy which is really benefiting her. However, that energy is really taking over her head and her neck which is kind of moving in its own world disconnected from the rest of the body. If she were to be able to have a command over all of her movement where her whole body can be strong and direct and energetic she would really perfect this step. As the dancer starts by performing a series of smaller step touches and some swaying shoulders and arms to the side, her gaze is fairly low and inconsistent throughout, which demonstrates perhaps a lack of confidence but also maybe a sense of finding the rhythm. She is strongly connected to the rhythm in some moments and in other moments she does tend to lose it, specifically through the use of her arms and her upper body. Her lower body stays fairly consistent, particularly in the step touches. As the dancer's performing this big stomp down into a lunge with a slicing of her arms through the air, her shape of her body is clear, though she can use some definition, particularly in her spine and her head, which is creating a little bit of an awkward line, as well as this back leg. However, her front leg and her arms are quite clear. She's really off the rhythm and is appearing quite awkward here. She's not stomping down on any particular moment in the music, which is really disconnecting her here and creating kind of an awkward feeling to the movement overall. As the dancers performing a series of jumping kick wall changes here, they feel very disconnected from the music and inappropriate to what's happening the music, which is slowing down and giving more of a flowy quality to it where her movement is more energetic, including the jump which is just quite awkward in juxtaposition of the music. I think she or the choreographer could have made a better choice here. As the dancer is performing this repetitive series of slides diagonally backwards into the space, again she could benefit from some clarity in her upper body. She's performing specific choreography here with the arms on a diagonal, but her movement dynamic or her movement quality here is quite unclear. She could benefit from some clarity and some more direct movement, getting those arms straight out with more energy and more power. But right now they're kind of flicking with less of an indirect or more of an indirect quality, which is throwing her off the rhythm quite a bit and overall kind of limiting her abilities in this step. As the dancer performs these series of kicks, kickball changes while she's jumping backwards into the space. It feels disconnected from the music and feels overall inappropriate for the chosen music of this performance. Overall, it's just kind of an awkward choice. I'm not sure if this was choreographed by someone else or by the dancer herself, but it doesn't really make sense with the music or with the rest of the movement that she's performing. In these series of more rhythmic steps where she's kicking her leg out or scuffing her foot out from underneath her while changing and adding a slight kind of jump or scoot with her supporting leg, she has moments of clarity where she finds the rhythm and other moments when she's performing this step she's quite disconnected from the rhythm. So she's lacking consistency in this movement. The times that she performs it with a clear rhythmic embodiment are great and the other times where she's connected from the rhythm, disconnected from the rhythm up here, a little bit more awkward. However, she does have some clear arm choreography happening which is pretty consistent throughout and her feet remain consistent throughout as well.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And there as he's tried to pick it up, you can see some of that uncooked egg from the center is popped off the center of the mixture and now is beginning to cook as it's kind of pouring off of the omelet. He's cut the ends off the onion on both sides. A good way to start, it helps get the papery skin to start to pull away and it also removes parts that you don't wanna use in your food. And he turns it again. He's moved into a level of excessive sort of attending to this particular item. It's well cooked at this point and needs to be moved to a plate, but he continues to turn it and press it. He's adding the onion pieces to the bowl with the green pepper. Not all the pieces, but some of them. He's added a red spice, which I'm assuming is paprika. If it were red pepper that was crushed, it'd be quite hot. And here he's flipped his omelet, which moves it from the French style omelet where you would only fold it or roll it. And this is more of a masala omelet, which also makes sense with the raw vegetables that he put in. They were not cooked before. They were incorporated into his mixture. And here you can see where, as he flipped it, he had more of that raw egg mixture sort of splatter in the pan. He might've needed to wait longer for the egg to cook through more because obviously it was not cooked enough not to make this mess. And he's cutting the half with the flat side down, which is smart. It keeps it anchored to the cutting board, makes it less likely to run away. But he does not have the papery skin removed, so he is now pressing that into every onion slice as he cuts. You always want to remove that. It is inedible. Here he's gone underneath his blade to retrieve his pepper, which is a terrible idea. No one wants to lay a knife on their hand with a blade down. So you want to avoid doing things like this. It's not very safe. He's gotten a pepper. Now he's placed his pan over the heat. His pan is rather large, depending on the size omelet he's trying to make. Typically, you want to have the omelet size fitting to the pan's base diameter. So a little bit more sloped sides would be helpful here. It also just creates a nice round final product, and it's easier to control inside the pan. and tipping the pan to let the oil spread more evenly over the full surface. He placed the pepper in a bowl and now he's working on the onion. He's quickly cutting the pepper crosswise to make small circles which will mirror a dice if he uses a dice on his onion. And now he's stirring it vigorously in the form of a whisk. You can use a fork, a spoon, an actual whisk for this. A whisk small enough for this bowl would actually probably capture too much of those particulates and become a pain. So he's stirring with his spoon. He wants to evenly blend all these items together so that his omelet has even flavor. And here you can see the light color of egg means it's already starting to cook through, which means he had chosen a really good heat for his egg mixture to begin with. There's a little bit of darkness in the center. That's because the egg mixture is probably concentrated there, and that is a little thicker. He's retrieved a plate. He's added some salt to the mixture. I don't recommend this pressing on an egg mixture like this, especially with an omelet. You want it to be nice and fluffy, a lighter texture, and this will create a more dense mixture because you're pressing out any of the air. It also is typical of a novice cook to press things like this because they're concerned that it's not going to cook through enough. So to level up his culinary skills, having a little bit more patience and knowing that the mixture will cook through, it doesn't have to be highly attended, would be a method that he could use to get better at cooking. He's moving the items that he chopped, the pepper and red onion, into the bowl with the egg. He probably could have just put the egg in the bowl with the onions and pepper. He's retrieved a metal spatula from his supplies. He's using a cutting board that actually has a cutting tool affixed to it. It's very unique, not something I've ever seen before, but it can be a good idea. He's gotten a spoon and a small bowl. He's using a spatula to test the edges of his omelet, make sure they're not sticking. And now he's pouring his egg mixture into the pan. As you can see, the full amount of egg mixture is much smaller than the outside area of the pan. What's gonna happen here is he's just gonna have a very oddly shaped, it won't be a great looking circle. It's totally fine. And one more turn. He's got a large skillet with very low sides, it's almost flat across the bottom and over the sides. It looks to be cast iron which is very good at conducting heat and a good option for omelets. He's taken a few of the pieces and turned them so that he gets more of a dice on it. It's a little large dice, but he is getting more of like a square piece. Now he's continuing to cut with the papery skin on the outside. I wouldn't recommend continuing that. He's adjusting the heat under his pan. and a small red onion. And he's used his spoon to break the, crack the egg. It's a great way to crack an egg. Quickly makes a dent in the shell, then you can put your fingers in and get the egg out quickly without making a big mess on your countertop. And you can see his omelet moves pretty freely in the pan. The pan being so large, again, he has to chase the omelet around the pan because it's got a good amount of lubrication underneath it. So it's not going to stick, but it is kind of moving. He's adding a fair amount of oil to his pan. It's a great idea as it's heating. You always want to add the oil after the pan is beginning to warm. It thins then, and you can spread it out more over evenly in the surface. This could be ghee also, but I'm not quite sure. It definitely is an oil of some sort. You also want to stir it enough to have the yolk and the white of the egg incorporate with all the rest of the pieces, but also with one another. He's lit his stove, it looks to be a propane stove. If his pan had steeper sides, he would actually have a little leverage to go against the sides.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

And since it hit this position of the backboard outside of the square, he needed to have good side spin in this direction for the ball to hit off the backboard and spin into the basket this way. As he makes the layup, the ball comes through the basket and he catches it, keeping the rhythm of the Mike and drill. When we do the Mike and drill, we do not want to let the ball hit the ground. Like we make the layup, catch it out of the net, and continue our correct footwork to the opposite side of the basket to make the layup. So he does a good job of not letting the ball hit the ground. However, as he catches the ball, he allows the ball to drop down to his waist level. Ideally, as we catch the ball, we want to keep the ball high around our upper chest to neck area without allowing the ball to drop down. So we catch the ball out of the net, keep it high, continue our footwork to the opposite side of the basket, and then from the high point where we're keeping the ball in our upper chest slash neck area, we raise it from that position to over our head and extend it out and make the layup on the opposite side of the basket. As he goes up for the right hand layup on the Mikan drill, he's doing the one-legged Mikan drill where he's jumping off of one foot. He shows the correct footwork by making sure he jumps off his left foot for the right hand layup. So this is the good footwork. We take a look at the ball. You see he has the ball in one hand. Ideally we would like to keep two hands on the ball and then as we go into our jump and explode to the front of the rim, that's when we begin to raise the ball up from down low to above our head. And as the ball passes our shoulder area, that's when we begin to transfer the ball from two hands to the right hand and then we extend the ball with our right hand and finish the layup off of the backboard. On this attempt, he places the ball inside the square here and it is just slightly below the top portion of the square. If not, it's hitting the line on the top portion of the square. So when we place the ball in this position, we don't want any side spin on the ball. Otherwise, the side spin that we generate will make it spin off the backboard here and we'll miss it off the left side of the rim. And on this attempt, he wanted to place the ball outside of the square in this area here. If he would have placed the ball here, the side spin would have carried the ball into the basket. But since he placed it more over to the left inside the square here, the side spin that he put on the ball would have spinned it off the backboard and we missed the layup to the left side of the basket. Take a look at the placement of the ball on the backboard. It is outside of the square on the backboard. It has pretty good height as it's almost near the top portion of the square on the backboard. And since it hit the backboard outside this portion of the square, we need good side spin on the ball for it to spin off of the backboard and into the basket. And he does a good job of putting side spin on this layup attempt and the ball spins off of the backboard and went into the basket. Here he does a good job of extending the ball high in his left hand and releasing the ball at his highest point out of his left hand, off his fingertips and onto the backboard. We take a look at his right hand. You see how it's kind of down low. Ideally we would like for that hand to be up a little bit higher to protect the ball away from the defense who's on his inside right shoulder. By him having that arm up, it will allow him to keep the defense away from the ball, which is in his left hand, and he can release the ball out of his fingertips. And that right arm will slow the defense down as they come across and attempt to block or contest the shot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She's using her spoon to blend the mixture together, the raw vegetables, the spices, and the egg. And here you can see the lighter color indicates that the egg is already beginning to cook and then you can also see that you got this kind of wavy little edge right here which it's a preference thing. A classic French omelet would never be done in a pan that gave it a free-form edge because the beauty of it is a lot in the perfect circle. She added salt to the mixture of raw vegetables. She's cutting a second pepper, same way. She's cut another piece of her onion off. She's cut both ends off and now she's cutting it in half. She's using a small what looks to be almost a utility knife, which oftentimes can be quite sharp. So they are good for these things. She's retrieving a plate from her cupboard. The peppers are going to add a little bit of heat to the dish, but not anything tremendous. These could be any kind of pepper. They're very thin. They could be Thai bird chilies. I think it's a matter of taste whether you like the heat of those or not. And they're very thin and not terribly long, so she's just cutting them crosswise and they are instantly the same size as the onion in the dice. Now she's got a metal spatula with a nice wide top on it and she's got it underneath her omelet. She waited a while to let it cook further on that base. She's adding a red spice that I believe is Kashmiri chili powder. It is common in Indian cooking and also adds a smoky layer of flavor to the dish. you She's adding her mixture to the pan and you can see instantly that her mixture is much smaller than the diameter of the pan, more like a pancake and less like an omelet in this situation because it's not confined to on those edges to make a perfect circle so it's probably going to get a little less than perfect as a circle. Now she's flipped her omelet again. She's gotten several chili peppers from her basket. She has a very small bowl so she doesn't have a lot of area to move that stuff around. Something a little larger would be helpful and something that had sloped sides. Her bowl actually has straight sides so it's a little bit harder to get things moving around as easily. She might want to whisk this a little bit or just go more vigorously in a stirring motion. At this point she's pushing it back and forth. and she's placing it on the plate. This omelet is more of a masala omelet is what it's called. It's got raw vegetables in it that aren't pre-cooked before they're added to the mixture. It's served flat and not rolled or folded as a French omelet would be. Hers is definitely very free form. It's not a great looking masala omelet, but it is accurate in the way that she's prepared it. She's got a large diameter pan that looks to be similar to a cast iron skillet. It is very slightly sloped on the sides. Now she's taking a spoon to crack that shell and she's going to crack the egg into the bowl. She's lit her cooktop. She looks to have something like a propane cooktop, which is similar to a gas stove. And her pan is directly over the heat. Now she's turned her omelet and it's kind of made more of like an oblong shape at this point. It's moved away from being circular. Not ideal. You definitely would like it to be more of a circular shape. She's continued to cut the rest of the half of this onion by cutting portions off and then making cuts into that. She would be more efficient to go ahead and just make her cuts in the exact same style she's doing it, into the whole half of the onion, flat side down, making long cuts, turning the entire group and then cutting those crosswise. Then that will be a full dice, so she doesn't have to do so many little pieces at a time. She added oil or ghee to her pan. Ghee is clarified butter with the fats removed. This is gonna be a barrier between her omelet and the pan. It also helps to really solidify any nonstick surface so that your egg doesn't stick because egg notoriously is very sticky. She's cut just a small sliver off her onion and now she's cutting it long ways and turning it 45 degrees to make a dice making cuts again crosswise she's loosening the omelet from the pan. It doesn't seem to be sticking but she is pushing her spatula well underneath it to make sure that it's not doesn't have any sticking parts. She has a small red onion she's cutting the end off of.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He also is incorporating the arms, though he could benefit from some additional clarity in the shaping of the arms. He's got a nice slight bend in his knees, which is helping him to move quickly and efficiently, and is overall demonstrating this turn with a fair amount of clarity. As the dancer is transitioning between a series of basic salsa steps as well as some additional movement that's a little more expansive in the movement vocabulary, he's struggling to transition in between steps and is often compensating for this by moving his feet in a way that's a little bit more unclear and also lacking clarity in the movement of his arms, though they are incorporated. You can see here he's got his pelvis dropped back, which is helping him to be more grounded. However, he would benefit from really bending his knees more and overall some additional rehearsals so that he can find that clarity needed to connect more deeply to the rhythm. As the dancer is performing this ball change backwards, he's losing a lot of clarity, particularly in his footwork. You can see that his right foot is sickled and kind of bending over the toe here, where he really should be planting the feet down, performing a really solid ball change as he's locomoting backwards. He's also losing some clarity in his arms. While they're incorporated, they're not necessarily performing the slicing or kind of the swiping motion that they should be, and overall would benefit again from dropping the pelvis, bending the knees, and grounding in his movement. As the dancer performs this ball change step where he's stepping out to his left hand side here, he's got a lot of nice clarity in his feet. However, he is losing that grounding that he had before. He needs to focus on bending his knees and dropping his pelvis back to be more grounded. He's also activating his range of motion in the wrong direction. He's really moving his head and torso and arms and upper body in general from side to side where he really should be undulating on this kind of diagonal movement and incorporating the pelvis more as a hinge here. If you were to be more grounded, he would be able to activate that range of motion in the pelvis as well as finding some clarity in the head which again is really moving in this kind of side to side or horizontal axis rather than moving in this kind of more grounded movement that's emerging from the pelvis here. As the dancer begins to move through some quicker varied movements, he's demonstrating that he might have a more beginner understanding of the movement vocabulary here. He's struggling to connect deeply to the rhythm as well as to find clarity. However, some high points here is he's really including his arms choreographically in a way that makes sense and is appropriate, but overall would benefit from finding some clarity in his footwork as well as the incorporation of his pelvis and his torso. As the dancer performs this lunging step outwards, as he's lunging his right foot outwards and shaking his shoulders or shimmying his shoulders and incorporating his arms into that shaking, shimmy in motion, he demonstrates that he has an understanding of the movement vocabulary here and is feeling confident. He's able to embody polyrhythm, moving his lower body in a different rhythm, a rhythmic pattern than his upper body, which is moving at this faster, more staccato pace. He's also really nicely grounded here. He has a nice deep bend in his knees, his pelvis is dropped back, and overall he appears confident and clear in his movements. As the dancer transitions out of the turns, he's not able to do so with much clarity and precision, particularly because he doesn't necessarily incorporate his head. He needs to spot his head more during this turn to find some more stability as he's moving in and out of this turn, as well as some clarity in his arms. However, he really needs to find clarity, particularly in his footwork. You can see this right foot kind of starts to slide out from under him slightly as he's transitioning from this turn into the next movement phrase, and overall would really benefit again from grounding and from some additional rehearsal to find clarity here. As the dancer performs a basic salsa box step around himself, he again demonstrates what knowledge he does have of the movement vocabulary. He's got a lot of clarity in his footwork here, and his pelvis is dropped back slightly. However, he would really benefit from dropping it back more, bending those knees more, and overall grounding through his movement so that he could activate a greater range of motion in his pelvis. He's incorporating his arms choreographically, though he could really use some clarity and refinement here. While he's incorporating the arms, he's moving in kind of bigger, bouncier motions, which is what's really throwing him off from connecting to the rhythm.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Potentially, the arm, if it was going to go straight up to the hold, then the climber will need to create a body wave, meaning that if he is going to be standing on the lowest foot first, he would do the same motion where he will go out left to keep his chest close to the wall. And once the climber has his chest close to the wall, then he would pose the stance forcefully to then transfer his center of gravity over to the right side. Then the climber will be able, in that moment, to send his arm up to the next hold. Here we can see the climber is going up for the reach and has released a left hand but the arm has come in between the climber and the wall. This could potentially throw off the climbers center of gravity when he's supposed to engage on keeping the chest as close to the wall and the arm being in the middle could be an obstacle for direction as the climber will need to stay under the hold that he's going for the reach. The arm being in the middle could potentially drive him away from the wall when making this stance. As we can see, the climber is engaging at the grips above. As we can see, the upper body is being engaged. This so that the climber is able to release position, release the feet pressure down below, but continually has to apply pressure to not let go or not drop the feet from the hold. The climber does this by first bringing the right foot to be placed at the foot, at the foothold. And then so that way the climber can then release the left toe out of the foothold. Here the climber is starting at a one hold start where he places both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching and places the grips as a pinch hold meaning that the climber is able to wrap the fingers around the hold by sending the fingers above at the top which you will have to create pressure by leaning on the hold and to sustain the grip he sends the thumbs underneath to secure the grip. The climber was able to make the reach up to the hold but did not point accurately to the area where the climber needed to sustain the grip. Also potentially the right foot being in place at a higher stance it seems as his center of gravity was still over the left foot that was lower in the placement. This when the climber gets to push down on the right foot it would actually drive the climber away from the wall which would not be a successful reach in this instance and the left foot has come out of place due to the leap and the dynamic stance. The climber here is going for the reach. And body positioning is key. In this instance, the left foot is the area where he is shifting or bringing his center of gravity over, seeing the chest getting close to the left side, and also potentially making closure to the wall. As we can see, the climber was able to successfully reach the top grip. And to do this, the climber again needs to engage on the grips in order to release pressure for the climber to make a foot switch. As we can see, the climber had brought his left toe to be placed on the hold before releasing the right toe. As we can see, the climber is making gestures with his hands. And this is because the climber will need to visualize the sequence before getting onto the wall. It's important when the climber is going up for the reach, being the right hand up to the next hold, he needs to keep his right side as close to the wall to make an efficient reach. This, he does that by extending the left leg, which this is called flagging out, and also bringing then the foot that's being in place with the knee pointing inwards. As we can see, the left toe is pushing against the wall, and this will help the climber to keep balance when making the reach so that the weight that is shifted to be sustained by the right foot. Also, the leg being extended helps the climber to keep his center of gravity being on the core to be close to the wall as he makes the pull of himself when making the stance. So, that's the basic idea of the flagging out. So, if you're a beginner, you can do this with a little bit of practice. If you're a pro, you can do this with a little bit of practice. If you're a beginner, you can do this with a little bit of practice. If you're a pro, you can do this with a little bit of practice. If you're a beginner, you can do this with a little bit of practice. If you're a pro, you can do this with a little bit of practice. If you're a beginner, you can do this with a little bit of practice. If you're a pro, you can do this with a little bit of practice. As we can see with the climber's body position, he's sustaining the one hold start as a pinch and leans back to create pressure, still keeping himself ready for the next move as he's engaging on a pull up. Down below, the climber is raising his hips. This is to transfer his center of gravity to be pushing his weight over with the left toe that's being in place. As we can see, the right leg is extended and the toe is tapping against the wall. This is to continue to keep the climber balanced when sending the weight of the climber over to the left foot being the highest. And also helps the climber to sustain on that stance of keeping his hips raised. Since the climber's feet are no longer on the mat, then the climb has started.

Ball on top of the foot, rolling it to the right again. Standing foot very far away from the heavier part of this touch. So we'd want to see ideally the standing foot brought forward and get as close to the ball as possible. And then get the right foot in between to open that stance through. Now our balance is already getting over the ball before we take the touch and we can move our whole body through this touch in this direction. And then readjust our feet so once the ball arrives here, we can take some quick steps here, here and here to readjust and maybe get our left foot in here, the right foot behind. Short distance before the touch and then we open the distance through the touch, bringing our next foot around and keeping the feet close and not being off balance and stuck in the mud too much. Just again inefficiencies that are slowing down the overall speed of the ball but taking away fluidity as well and just overall efficiency. So on this sequence from top to bottom, we have seen a couple of inside to inside shuffles and they've been semi-successful. One of the main reasons being that the player is getting their standing foot close to the inside of that ball but not in a space that it's going to get in the way of the ball moving across. So they're allowing the ball to clear their toe but because the standing foot is close to the ball, they can now move the ball-touching foot, so in this case the left foot, through the touch and now the left foot will plant here, allowing them to bring this foot from close proximity to another close proximity spot to stop that ball and to move it forward. So again just touching on balance and the importance of stance and where we're planting our feet, always closer to the ball is better. The further away from the ball we're consistently planting our standing foot, the more off-balance we're going to be and the more inefficient overall we will be dribbling. Again, just another similar stancing issue here. Player facing outside opposite direction of the direction the next touch is aiming to be taken. This again is due to heavy planting, not getting close enough to the ball upon most touches and not being on the toes in between the steps. Just a lot of flat foot steps and bearing a lot of weight on many of the steps before touching the ball. So we see here kind of an efficient route from the ball through here. But again, just some issues with the stance and the touch. We can see a player using the inside of the right foot here to navigate the ball in this direction. And again, with that inside of the foot touch, there's only so far that this foot can go forward when it's opened up at this angle. So it's much harder to take a bigger step along into this space while the foot is opened up that much. It's just going to be uncomfortable on the knee and it's going to put weight on quite a twisted knee, which is not going to be able to sustain the bodyweight load as better as an outside exposed foot could do. So what I mean by that is if our foot is maybe pointing in this direction, the outside is exposed to the direction we're going, we can take a bigger step with that foot and we can land it more out here. And we can still bear weight pretty heavily on that because it's facing straight forward, more or less. And our knee can get on top of the foot. So again, we're seeing this kind of inefficient touch type pretty often where the player is actually slowing themselves down because they're trying to step in this direction with their foot opening up. Again, it's just not very safe for the knee and can't actually extend the distance between the feet as much when this foot wants to open out in this direction. And again, twisting the limbs. So just another kind of inefficient habit that this player is shown and which is kind of slowing down the dribble. We're seeing here again another one of these rolls with the bottom of the right foot in this direction. You can see right now the player is putting weight on the ball, the standing foot is back here and then right foot is the second standing foot. We kind of draw a line through both feet where our balance is. It's going to be leaning over this way and it kind of causes a big heavy touch. Ball comes way wide, the player has to readjust the stance, bring in their left foot to kind of stand in this area here. Whereas we don't really need the ball to be any further away than, optimally, somewhere around this direction to take our touch up here and to help us move on. So, inefficiencies caused by just an inefficient touch type that is recurring in this series of touches. Just a touch on the speed and take note of the speed and tempo of the stepping between touches Very casual walking speed here in this direction where a player is just kind of going with the flow staying with the ball, but it's again at walking speed, it's not a great example of Tempo and just pushing the speed of both touches on the ball and steps between touches We're seeing here again early on another inefficient touch type. So we're seeing the foot on the ball here, rolling it in this direction, away from the body. Standing foot here, so the stride is going to be opened up. But what has to happen is this foot has to stay in the air until the ball gets beyond the space that the foot wants to stand in without the ball touching that foot and being disrupted. So it's one where the player has to roll it and almost hesitate before they can take the step. And the balance is not quite off because once this foot plants, the standing foot is so far away that it needs to come in closer to this kind of area to transfer weight onto this foot and now we can move this foot. So it's just a bit of an inefficient touch here in terms of balance and in terms of speed. Not one I'd recommend for speeding this exercise up. and just a recurrent inefficiency here. Weight put on the ball, weight here, weight on the ball, standing foot back here, ball needs to go in this direction and the body is facing this direction. So just not shuffling the feet, not getting close enough to the ball, fast enough, allowing it to get too far away and then planting heavily on the standing foot, not being light on the feet to get the standing foot, maybe here to allow this foot to then extend through the touch. we see here again heavy plant and a heavy pause right foot on top of the ball again pulling it to the right this left foot heavily planted not on the toes and not quite ready to lean in through the touch just the body overall not quite ready to lean through the touch but kind of pausing rolling it this direction and then following up with a step from this foot again what we'd like to see more efficiency more fluidity through this not pausing not stopping and changing directions hard with the ball in terms of going forward and then it's a pause and then it's a move in this direction what we would what we have seen from this players they can use the outside of the foot so can they make more of an effort to readjust their feet faster with shorter quicker steps and just to just use the outside of the foot to bring that ball through in a more diagonal angle and follow it up with close proximity quick stepping patterns So here we're seeing a nice directional change with two touches that are kind of linked into one series. So we saw the inside of the foot has nudged the ball forward and then we can see after that touch the foot comes across the ball and is now facing this way with an outside touch. The ball has kind of come from right to left, back, from left to right in one series of a touch, two touches. And we can see that the standing foot has shuffled between touch one and between touch two. So with the standing foot taking a quick shuffle to here it allows us on this point as this foot lands on the ground to get the foot in around the other side of the ball and to stride through the ball in this direction. Generally this would be used if there was a defender oncoming from the front. We want to just give them a quick visual cue of the ball moving over here. So they would come in this direction and then we quickly change direction and move it into this space with the defender getting attracted to here. It's not an easy move to pull off but what it does do is it puts a lot of speed in the ball in the second phase of the move which in this case kind of messes up the rest of the sequence because now we've got big momentum in the ball which we have to rush to take the touch through here which then causes the player to rush and take this touch. And we'll see Paul kind of moves forward, the player does a nice save with a pull back and a kind of a V pull push and basically makes it get from here to here to here but this part here was not really a part of the plan and it's happened because of the additional momentum that was put in this zigzag touch. So here we're seeing a sole roll but in the opposite direction of which most of them were going in, which was the outside. Generally the player was rolling them from left to right with the right foot away from the body. Here we see right to left across the standing foot. So we see both feet, weight on both feet. And the player is actually, we can see left arm up here, leaning into the touch. So they're staying with the ball, which is much better overall balance and stancing because it allows the player to plant. So when this ball is rolled to the left, the right foot will be nearby and then the left foot can come around and take a touch on the ball somewhere around this region, which then we can see after that touch, short distance between the feet. And the stance can be readjusted a lot more efficiently to allow the player to maybe set up a situation where now they have maybe right and left foot on the ball and they're balancing in the opposite direction to take that next touch. So more control of the balance, not leaning away from the direction that the touch is going in, but actually leaning in the direction that the touch is being taken in. Here again, just seeing this touch. Standing foot back here somewhere. Very big stance, bringing the ball through this direction. Again if we look at the other side, big stance inside of the foot. Big plant, big distance between the steps. It's just going to slow the player down and not going to help with keeping the ball efficiently close to the cones and having a nice short route around these cones. So again, just stancing issues here. Just seeing here, last cone that the players, really all they need to do is just bring the ball around in this kind of a route where it's more efficient and it's a short distance from here to here. But what we are seeing is this outside roll with the bottom of the foot again rolling the ball way further away than it needs to be rolled. What we could see here which would help speed would be just a little outside of the foot nudge forward into this kind of area. When the ball then lands here we could bring our right foot into this area, swing our left foot in here and just go with a couple of left foot nudges in this direction to stay close to the cone. So again just inefficiency, stance issues, balance issues and just touch selection a little bit off. Still just seeing just kind of walking pace, overall just a lot of weight going on each step on each standing foot and the pace not being pushed with smaller steps, faster steps on the toes and trying to stay kind of over the ball. The player is happy enough to let the ball get far away, doesn't mind planting, reaching, opening up the stride to try pull the ball back and therefore is leading to just a overall inefficient dribbling patterns consistently on this one. Then we're back from that good efficient outside of the foot touch, we're back now to again that more hesitant, slow inside of the foot touch style where we can see here inside of the foot trying to shepherd the ball through this gap. Standing foot here, so right foot takes a touch, lands somewhere around here, now this foot has to try and get in here without touching the ball and it's just as we can see the lean, the balance of the player here at a slant and it stays at a slant coming through here not allowing the player to almost shift their balance to go through the next gap. So it's just a slower kind of touch bringing the ball across the standing foot is always going to be a little bit slower than using the outside foot to navigate. So if we use, we're going this direction, the outside foot is now this one closer to the outside of the direction we're going to. So we'd like to see this foot coming around here and bring that ball in this direction versus the inside of the foot coming across this foot and where it has to potentially go next. So keeping the ball on the outside allows us to move faster, cut out this patient waiting for stepping foot to have enough space to stand in and allows us to readjust our balance a lot better when stepping through using that outside. The last one from here to here to here again just kind of at casual walking pace and not really pushing the tempo where we know the tempo can be pushed higher in this one as we have seen but just consistency wise a little bit up but more so on the downside for the tempo. So in this video here we are looking at dribbling. It looks like the player is mostly going to be weaving in and out of these three cones. Primarily there is a cone up here. The player does visit a few times but stops going to eventually as this video progresses. So we look at the following stuff. Fluidity, different surfaces of the foot the player is using and how he is using those. The techniques, the stance and the centre of gravity of the player, the ball speed, tempo of touches. If there are any repetitive or challenging sequences in here. We look at the steps between the touches, the tempo of those, how fast he is covering distances and then the creativity and consistency within the dribble and if there are any recurring mistakes or recurrent inefficiencies within the dribble. And just to touch on previous comments on the bottom of the foot roll to the outside of the body and Why it can potentially cause issues? we see the ball here stuck under the right leg and Left foot having to jump ahead of the body because of balance issues This is actually resulting from two of those touches consecutively Which causes the players balance to just progressively get more inefficient as The touch sequence went on because again of the mechanics of this touch type and What it's doing to the balance of the player? So we see now it's progressively Slowing the player down and hindering the balance more and more as this exercise is continues Another one of these touches again, look at the feet. Super wide apart before the touch is even taken, so after the touch they're only going to get further apart. And the proximity of the ball being so close to this line, it's going to have to go in a more horizontal angle versus if we can actually get to this ball when it's somewhere around here, standard foot, similar area, right foot, could just come around and nudge the ball into this space in this kind of a direction to get around. We can see here the player just having a little bit of an issue with the Headset, I think it's every time they're kind of jumping after the ball and planting their foot It's causing it to kind of shuffle on their head. So We can see also not only is it having a negative effect on their driven when they're planting heavily, but Also, the headset is shown how Heavy they are jumping into some of these touches because of the readjustment so it's proof that Not quite efficient in stepping and in just the the energy output on the straddle So here we see an example of the outside of the foot touch with the right foot here nudging the ball in this direction. Left foot is standing here so we can see this distance is opening up through the touch. And it allows the player to move at more speed. Unfortunately we don't see this super often or repeating but just to touch on the type of touch and the stance we can take through our touches and how we can readjust our balance and readjust the standing feet. Here is an example of a touch which is more advantageous in this sort of exercise and dribbling in general that I would like to see this player try to reproduce more often and more consistently. Just to look at the stance here, ball moving from left to right, player facing very hard left. Standing foot very far away from the ball, having to lean and pull the ball and twist in one touch. We could see standing foot getting closer to the ball, getting on the opposite side to bring the right foot here. But ultimately the ball should be closer to this kind of range, not too far away from the line of the cones. Which is going to put a strain on balance, stepping and efficiency. Again, just seeing the use of the outside roll with the bottom of the foot here, so rolling the ball towards the outside of the body. As we can see, the ball will get stuck in this area with the standing foot here. This foot then will be brought in to stand beside, and there will be another push given to the ball to move it up here. What would be a little bit more of a natural, organic, efficient move would be to drop the toe in here, kind of slant our foot, and then we can actually open our stride through the touch to move the ball into this space, which is more forward, allows us to get to the next step quicker. From there, right foot steps down, we get left foot in, right foot can take another step potentially here, and then the left foot can come across and meet the ball to bring it in this direction with a few fast steps and a much more speedy route, much more efficient and one where the balance will be readjusted and will be more correct for the touch that is going in the next direction. And then we can see again another good example of leaning through the ball and towards the direction that we're going We can see left foot has been planted here Shoulders more leaned in this direction And the player is able to follow up with quick steps through this touch We can see the right foot has just taken a touch on the ball knocking it this direction The foot is not opened up in this direction to reveal the inside But it is this direction to reveal the outside on that touch And it allows the player to step in this direction a lot more efficiently Because they are again putting the weight in this direction Following up this foot does get across and gets closer So it's a more natural and faster way to step through touches to the right hand side So using the outside of the foot and balancing slightly to our right too So very early on we see an inefficient touch type here. We're seeing left standing foot just being used to knock the ball in this direction. We're seeing the inside of the right foot being exposed to push the ball through in this direction. So again standing foot here, just knock the ball in this direction. Inside of the foot being used now to nudge the ball through this gap. This here will slow a player down because they cannot take as big a step with this right foot through the ball. So if we actually turn the right foot to expose the outside of the foot and use our touch more in this manner, whereas if this foot is more coming through this way, the player can extend their stride through the touch. It doesn't have to be quite this big but in this direction. And they can move in this direction more naturally taking a bigger step. Whereas again we see the inside of the foot coming through the ball in this manner. It's hard if the inside of the foot is now facing this way. It's hard to navigate the ball this way and it does not allow us to take as big a step through and to transfer our balance from this foot to maybe the outside of the foot step, maybe landing somewhere here. We've taken a much bigger stride and we can now transfer the weight onto this foot here and we can bring the ball in this direction a little bit easier and much faster.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here she is spreading the egg mixture out over the oil, making sure that it is in a fairly even layer so that the omelet cooks at the same time and there's not too much in one area so that it takes longer to cook. Now she cuts off the heat and is ready to serve the omelet. This is an appropriate step for her to add oil just before she is going to put the egg mixture into the pan. If you added it any earlier, the oil could get so hot that it smokes. The reason being is you don't want the pan to get too hot before you're finished mixing your eggs. If the pan's too hot you risk pouring the eggs into the pan and having it burn before you can cut the heat down. Additionally, I don't know if she's extremely tall or if she's standing on a platform, but here you can see that she has to lean over a lot to be able to even work on her workstation. I would recommend either putting, stepping off the block or having an elevated workspace so that she could more easily cut and not have to lean over as she's doing here. She cuts off both ends of the red onion so that she can have a flat surface which you can see here and She pushes her The discards which is both of the unusable ends off the cutting board. I like this Choice that she has made because you don't want to have the skin of the onion mixed in with the Actual vegetables that you're going to use in the omelet And while she only grabbed a single egg for this omelet, it appears that she's using close to half of a teaspoon of salt, which is a lot of salt based on this volume of omelet mixture. She begins to season the mixture with salt here and then kind of realizes that she's maybe out of step and she begins to light her pan before she finishes seasoning. I would do these steps differently. I would add my egg mixture first, then season the egg mixture, then light my pan. I'm not certain why she flipped it for the second time. Maybe she noticed that there was some egg mixture that went uncooked on the first side, but this step of flipping it a second time is unnecessary. Once she has turned the omelet one time, she needs to let it cook on the other side for like I said two to three minutes and it should be done at that point. Here she is seasoning the mixture with paprika and salt. This step is a little out of order. First, you would want to add your egg to the mixture so then you could determine how much seasoning you actually need to put in based on the liquid measure of the egg. A single egg omelet like this is probably between a fourth and a half of a cup of liquid measure based on what I'm seeing. And that would take two to three minutes per side to cook. To create your omelet, first you want to assemble your tools and all the equipment that you're going to use prior to starting the omelet. Alternatives for oil would be butter or pan spray. Here it appears that she has not used enough oil to fully cover the entire pan, only the center section. I would recommend putting enough oil in so that the entire bottom of the pan is coated. Here she uses a spoon to crack the egg directly into her bowl and uses the same spoon with which to stir her mixture. This is okay. I would recommend using either a fork or a whisk instead to incorporate air into the omelet mixture and give it more volume. Here she's cutting what appears to be a serrano pepper or three into a fine dice. This will be in combination with her red onion will be the toppings that fill out her omelet. Here she has grabbed an appropriate tool which is a flat spatula. This is going to be the right tool to use so that she can get the spatula underneath the entirety of the omelette and flip it over in a single turn. You can see that she's cutting her onion half into slices, but as you can also see, her fingers are exposed to the blade of the knife. I would recommend tucking your fingers up underneath your knuckles so that the knuckles are up against the side of the knife, not the fingers. Here she has selected a pan which is more of like a flat Skillet of sorts and then she is selecting a paring knife and a cutting board with which to chop her vegetables for the omelet", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

But again, I think her balance is sometimes a bit off, especially when she swings her head around. She has to find a way to do that where her, I think if she opened her feet out a bit and made sure her feet were nice and secure on the floor, then she would have the control and balance to spin her head around. What I do like is she has a really good use for arms. She's able to kind of just freestyle, wave them around a bit. And I do think he should do better at matching that a bit more and really supporting, really just matching her energy and bringing his up a bit because he does kind of bring it down. So here he had taken a step back with his left leg and she decided to lean back but he wasn't prepared for her to lean back so again I think following that lead of the partner because he was not able to support her leaning back correctly because he wasn't initiating that movement so she has to follow his lead she should have taken a step back as well instead of leaning all the way back. So here a bit more freestyle. Again, she's more on the rhythm of the beat more than him. And I think for kind of a freestyle moment where they're not quite connected and doing the steps together, it's important to remain on the beat because then they look more in sync as they're working together. So here they've done a rock step triple step together and then he spun her out and back. So I think a job at him leading and kind of reining her in to dance close and then spin her out and back in. So nice job there. So here the music definitely changes a bit. They start to do a bit of scatting. So I know they were not prepared for that part, but they continue on again with this movement where they put their arms over their heads and then draw their arms out together, which is nice. So here a nice moment where they are back connected again. Hands are correct. His hand is on her waist and hers is on his shoulder and they are walking side to side in sync. Their bodies are straightforward together so that's nice. And she is making eye contact with him but he's not quite looking at her so again that eye contact is important to stay connected with the partner. So even when she runs, that was a bit off the beat. So again, taking your time, really trying to feel and hone in the rhythms of the music so she's on the correct beat. So in the beginning, they're just doing a bit of freestyling movements, kind of just swinging their arms side to side, stepping and traveling all throughout the room. So I would say good use of space, good use of staying connected with eye contact, and just kind of staying together as they move throughout the space. She's more on the beat than he is, so he can definitely follow her lead a bit better. But nice job opening up, just keeping the rhythm and tempo. So here, this is a really lovely turn. She has her foot up in what's called passe, where it's to the knee. I think the foot could be a bit more closer to the knee here. So just needs to lift that knee up to get there. But the leg is straight, her body is straight, and she spins around. And I definitely think it would have been nice if he was there to just kind of have his arm out to support her and be ready once she's done turning. And here he's moving on a much slower pace and tempo than she is. I think she's on the on like a quarter note beat so one two three four he's on the one two three four on a slower half note whole count beat. So it doesn't really look like they're in sync and I think the energy because of that kind of makes it look like her energy is a bit higher than his even though they're on the same rhythm just a different like tempo and I think if he kind of matched her energy it would be a much better. I think with her movement, she has to be kind of careful because it looks like she keeps kind of being off balance. So she has to find a bit more control in her body and her movements so it's not so messy and out of control altogether. So here they reach their arms over their head nicely and then let go of Thuy's hand so she let go her left and him his right, sorry his left also. They're now connected with the right arm as it slides out so that was nice. So now once they are connected, they grab hands here. He spins her around. Again, really nice use of this space and not being afraid to really just move their bodies all around and just kind of play off the music a bit.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

As we shift our focus towards the right side of the frame on our player's release, again, he does a great job at getting his follow-through extended above his shoulder to generate more arc and accuracy it needs to be able to get above the rim and have the proper angle it needs to drop through our targeted area, which is the middle of the rim. As we look on the right side on the player's attempted jump shot, he does really well at getting his follow-through extension above his shoulders and jumping as well on the jump shot to create and generate more arc and accuracy it needs to be able to come down through the proper angle hitting our targeted area, the middle of the rim. As we look on the right side of the frame, as the player is going into his shooting motion, again, he provides the correct footwork by stepping with his left foot first, and bringing his right foot second, going into his shooting motion. A few advice we would like to make to improve on the player's efficiency on his jump shot. On the right side of the frame we will bring the ball placement position a little bit higher towards his chest area. This will help improve on a faster release of his jump shot to be able to prevent defenders from being able to block or have a difficult contest on the jump shot. It will also improve on getting the ball higher above the shoulder to create more arc, accuracy, and rotation to get the ball at the proper angle to come down through the net above the rim for a completed jump shot. As we shift our attention to the right side of the frame on the player's shooting motion, he does a great job of getting the ball placement position to be above his head, to gear the ball and propel it to have the right amount of arc and accuracy it needs to get above the rim, and the drop through the net for a completed jump shot. As we look at the player on the right side of the frame go into shooting motion. He does a great job in having his ball placement position parallel towards his chest. This will help improve a quicker release and to generate getting the follow-through extension above the shoulder to help propel the ball to gain more arc, accuracy it needs to get above the rim and to be able to have the proper angle of dropping through the net. As we look at the player's release on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player's momentum is bringing him backwards, not allowing the ball to generate enough arc it needs to be able to drop in the proper angle. This allows the ball to shift its angle to be able to drop on the rim and bounce out, resulting in the missed shot attempt. As we shift our attention to the left side of the frame, the player does a great job in his follow-through, shooting hand, having it come down, direct it towards the rim, guiding the ball into the right alignment to be able to hit our targeted area, which is the middle of the rim, and also guiding the ball to have the right arc, power, and rotation it needs to get above the rim to hit our targeted area. As we can see the guide hand to the left, palm is facing outward, five fingers are facing towards the left, giving the ball little or no effect towards the release. As we look at our player's release on the left side of the frame, again, the player's follow through hand is coming downward on the left side of the rim, directing the ball to go in that same direction on the left side of the rim. As we shift our attention to the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player's momentum is bringing him backwards, not allowing the ball to get the right amount of lift it needs to be able to generate more arc and accuracy it needs to go through our proper angle of coming down through our targeted area, which is the middle of the rim. Thank you for your attention. As we look at the player go into his shooting motion on the right side of the frame, we can notice that he uniquely steps with his right foot first and brings his left foot second into his shooting motion. As we look on the player's release on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the follow-through hand is shifted towards the left side of the basket, which is where it is directing the ball to go. We will want to move the follow-through hand to come down through the middle of our targeted area, which will direct and guide the ball into the right alignment to be able to generate enough arc and rotation and knees to get above the rim and to drop through the proper angle in the net. As we look on the left side of the frame on the player's attempted jump shot, he does really well in his follow-through hand, having the five fingers come down in the direction of his target. This gives the ball and guides it to the right alignment it needs to be able to hit our targeted area, which is the middle of the rim. As we look at the player's release on the right side of the frame, he does a great job at getting his shooting hand followed through the extension arm above his shoulders to generate more power, more arc, and more accuracy to be able to get above the rim and to come down through the proper angle through the net. As we look on the player's attempt on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player does a great job of having his follow through fingers come downward towards the direction of our target, which is the middle of the basket. This helps guide the ball in the right alignment and needs to be able to go down the proper angle through the net for a completed jump shot. As we look at the player's attempt on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player provides the correct footwork by stepping with his left foot first and bringing his right foot over to step into his shooting motion. As we look at the player's shooting motion, on the left side of the frame, the player does a great job of getting his shooting hand underneath the ball to be able to create more control and arc after the release. The player also does a great job of having his guide hand on the left side of the ball to be a primary placeholder and have little or no effect on the jump shot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And so the power that we generate for our arc all comes from our legs and it transfers through our body, goes up and through our body and then up on the release. But the final part of generating that power is that on the release that the elbow is above our eye level. If we do everything correctly with our legs, but then on the release, this elbow is too low and our arm is at this angle instead of this angle here on the release, then that means that all the power that we generated from our legs is not being used to create a good arc. But now it is going towards the power to go straight towards the basket. Now it's traveling towards the basket with too much force and too flat. And that's how we get these hard shots where we hit the front of the rim or these hard shots where it hits the back of the rim and the goal comes off long. We have to make sure that the power that we use from our legs is generated to make that good soft arc so then when it goes down into the basket, it hits the basket and goes in nice and softly. we take a look at his follow through of his right hand. He has a nice follow through, snapped the wrist, allowed the ball to roll off of his fingertips to create good backspin on the ball. So this is a really good follow through. We also can't see the back of his hand from this view. So from this view, from this view right here, since we're unable to see the back of his hand, we know that he did a good job of follow through and snapping his wrist and his fingers are pointing towards the direction of the basket. Now if we take a look at his guide hand, his left hand guide hand, you see that his palm is facing kind of downward. His fingers are in the right direction. They're pointing towards the basket. But ideally we don't want to turn the wrist to where the palm is facing downward on the basket. Ideally we would like for that palm to be open and facing the direction of his right hand, shooting hand, as he releases it. So the palm should be facing directly to his right and open directly to his right and not open and facing downward towards the ground. We don't want the palm open and facing in the direction of the basket. The fingers of the guide hand can be facing towards the basket as we release it, but we don't want the palm to be facing the direction. That palm should always be pointed directly to the right on the release. When the palm is open directly to the right on the release, that guarantees that there's no interference on the ball from our left hand, from the guide hand, as we release the ball. we take a look at his feet plate the placement of his feet his right foot is slightly in front of his left foot this allows for his elbow to be lined up directly with the front of the rim and his elbow is in so this is good foot placement it's nicely spaced and he's on balance with each shot As he jumps to release the shot, his momentum is actually going backwards and away from the basket. You can tell as he releases the ball, the momentum of his body is going a little bit backwards. In this situation, we want our momentum to either be straight up and down, or even slightly forward. Not too much forward, but our momentum should be heading slightly towards the basket on our shot. By us having our momentum going away from the basket, that makes the shot more difficult. You take a look at his hand placement on the ball. You can see his left hand is on the side of the ball, on the left side of the ball. And his right hand is underneath the ball with his right index finger placed in the middle of the ball. This is excellent hand placement on the ball.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So she's just come out of a basic step. Really nice use of the pelvis there with the basic step and nice job doing this sort of windmill arm here as she's bringing this knee up. Might be a little bit better if this was a straight elbow and this was a straight elbow just to kind of add some clarity to the shape. But the pathways are really nice with the two arms kind of going in these opposite windmill directions. Again using the hips as the pivot point so that she ends up having to do a bunch of movements turning in and out the hips in order to turn around. She's not spotting her head either so it makes this turn look kind of clunky. Again incorrect turn technique. She's turned to this externally rotated this hip and is going to turn her body around the hip and that's not Good turn technique. We never want to plant it foot in turns for the most part I'd love to see her on the ball of her foot and keeping these hips parallel with each other Driving the turn from the pelvis turning around and the ball of the foot is the pivot point Pretty good preparation here for the turn, a little bit turned in, so nervous that she's going to do the thing where she rotates around her hips instead of her balls of her feet, but we'll keep watching. Here she's brought the hands up to the head, not quite touching the head, and she's rotating the head here in this circle, but not again not exaggerated enough to be really read as a very clear moment. And I think it's because she's still a bit distracted and confused about what she's supposed to be doing. Again, looks like she's kind of communicating with her eyes with the instructor, looks a little bit hesitant, a little bit confused about what she's supposed to be doing. It's almost like she just decided to just ignore the instructor because she just kind of goes for it here. And this looks so good, like really nice shape, really good strength through this plie and with some energy through the back leg. Beautiful shapes here, really strong, very clear, lots of energy and grace through the fingers. Also like this nice kind of glance over the shoulder to emphasize this line looks super sassy, great expression in the face. This is all of a sudden, bam, it's coming together. Great stage presence, great shape. Great job bringing the arms up here to a nice straight elbow, really clear shape with the shoulders, energy out the fingertips. It's got a bit of a bouncing quality at the top of the movement because she doesn't just bring it up and hold it, she kind of brings it up and back down again. So I'd like to see it just a bit more clear and held for just a second before dropping it. Again, looking over the instructor either for help or because she's just distracted. So this is not, this whole video is just not performance ready yet. This is a really nice unexpected touch. She's got this arm nice and strong out here and has brought this other one in front and around to this side of the arm. This is really gentle sort of caress of her arm, which is just a really like unexpected and very brief moment, but looks really, really lovely. So what I'm saying is she's sort of like adding these details onto what she's doing that make it look like not just a cake and not just a cake with frosting, but like a cake with frosting and sprinkles and, you know, flower patterns and happy birthday written on it. So she's adding these details that really make it look more complete. Again, really nice isolation through the ribcage. Very, very skilled dancer. What's really nice is that she's also on the balls of her feet here and a little bit of a plie through the knee, a little bit of soft knee. So that's helping her to isolate through these different parts of her body effectively. She does initiate the movement in the same way as the previous side, so this is the second time she's done this movement. Unfortunately, she doesn't quite hit the shape as well, so she doesn't follow through with it. She kind of lets it go a bit too early, so we don't get to enjoy this shape, and it cuts off the nice texture that she established on the other side. Really nice movements here. She's doing a sort of box step here with the basic salsa step really nice Very strong very clear wish she was on the balls of her feet, but I'll the rest of it looks so good I'll grant her that that the arms look really graceful really well coordinated with the legs This is really, really beautiful. She's doing this really nice like undulating movement kind of forward and back with the pelvis as well as kind of accentuating that with sort of the opposite movement with the hands and arms. Really, really nice and also there's a bit of a attack at the beginning of this movement that just adds a little bit more texture to what she's doing. It looks really strong. She's very hesitant here to begin. I hear someone shouting at her. I think it's the instructor or the choreographer. I don't think she really knows what she's supposed to be doing. So that's not a great way to start. I don't know if it's that she doesn't know what she's supposed to be doing or if she's being, if she's just distracted by the instructor. But either way, we can't let ourselves get distracted while we're dancing. So this is a really weak start to her dancing here. Yep, so definitely planting one foot, rotating around the hip. That's incorrect turn technique. It's going to make this turn a bit wobbly and less efficient and effective and clear than it could be. The arms are pretty strong though, nice held position here. Looks like she may be spotting towards where she wants to go, so we'll just keep tracking that. I like that after she hit the knee with the left hand, she kept the windmill pattern going with both arms, which looks really, really strong. It's even looking better now than it did at the beginning of the windmill because she's got a straight elbow here, so it's really, really nice pathways in the air. Another little hesitant mincing step moment, again maybe forgetting what she's supposed to do. She also sort of just briefly glanced over toward the instructor again, so I think, you know, she just needs to really work on the choreography before performing it and make sure she understands it and knows it very well. She's starting to recover from that distraction and is doing this nice kind of isolation through the pelvis and rib cage. I can tell that she's very skilled at this but she's not doing it in a very exaggerated way and I think that's because she's still distracted. Really nice here. She's brought this arm up to this really beautiful shape energy out the fingertips nice straight elbow I like that the hand is really clearly placed on the thigh here but what's really the most interesting part about this shape is the way that she sort of initiates it from the chest and Then allows a little bit of a pulse to happen with the head coming in this direction Slightly it just looks really beautiful and just adds again more texture more dynamics to what she's doing and shows really excellent Control over her whole body and coordination over her whole body and using the whole body for the whole dance Nice job here kind of bringing this hand up and around the head in a nice way kind of following through with that hand looks really strong. This is not really an effective moment for her either. This is meant to be a leap onto this foot as far as I can tell with this foot coming around and she doesn't leap, she steps onto it so she doesn't have enough momentum to really make this as big and exaggerated as it could be. Still recovering or not still recovering but still in process of kind of figuring out what she's supposed to be doing the instructor continues Giving her commands and so I think it's just a little bit confusing a little bit hesitant so she really needs to get really solid in the choreography and also Try not to get distracted while dancing", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here they are playing a G chord while strumming all six strings of the guitar with the thumb. When practicing the last few phrases of this etude further, it would help to slow down the tempo a bit and watch the right hand fingers to try to smooth out the finger style pattern's motion, make it more connected and smooth rather than three separated motions. They are playing at a fast challenging speed and are demonstrating great accuracy with the pitch and also aim of the right hand fingers to play the strings individually. When performing the major scale, they alternate it between the pointer and middle fingers on the right hand when picking and playing each pitch. They again performed the same five pitches of the major scale here. There is the slightest bit of a buzzy sound quality to some of the pitches in this phrase. It would just help to watch the left hand fingers, make sure they're a little bit more curved and pressing firmly in the center of each fret to get the clearest possible sound. Here the guitarist is performing a different etude. They are demonstrating excellent right and left hand technique. You can see the left hand fingers are curved. They're getting a very clear sound to their playing and the right hand is continuing to execute the finger style pattern that is used for this etude multiple times in a row with a steady tempo. Here the guitarist is performing this section of the etude at a faster tempo. You can see them holding their chord shape in the left hand while they play the alternating finger style pattern using the thumb, pointer, and middle fingers. Repeatedly, they are able to play this section of the piece while maintaining this faster speed and accuracy with the pitches and strings that are being played. They now demonstrated the G chord within the phrase, so they played a few chords before the G chord leading into it and a few chords after. They are reincorporating this chord back into this section of the music. Here the guitarist demonstrated the first five pitches in their major scale. You can see they are demonstrating proper left hand position. Fingers 1, 2, 3, and 4 are curved and the thumb is on the back of the neck of the guitar. Here the guitarist demonstrated playing an individual string and pitch followed by multiple strings or a chord. The guitarist is shifting on the fretboard to lower pitches. As they shift, they are maintaining great finger position. The fingers are curved and they are getting a clear sound. Here the guitarist is performing a portion of their etude. They are using a finger style pattern, are executing it successfully with the right hand fingers, and are getting a clear sound to their playing while maintaining a steady tempo. They demonstrated this phrase again with two C chords instead of a G chord. That's what the guitarist was expecting to hear, but this pattern is incorrect. Here they performed the major scale starting with the first pitch and working their way up to the highest pitch in the scale. They demonstrated proper shifting and again are getting a nice clear sound quality to their playing and added some vibrato on the top pitch. They played this portion of the scale with accurate pitches and a clear sound quality.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She would also benefit from finding more separation between her feet here, which would give her a greater range of motion and a larger kind of base for her movement. As the dancer continues through the choreography, she demonstrates a basic understanding of the movement vocabulary. She's able to incorporate both her arms and her legs with a fair amount of clarity. However, she would really benefit from being more grounded in her movement, bending her knees, dropping her pelvis back, and activating a greater range of motion in her pelvis and up through her upper body, which would help her to embody the rhythm of it more deeply. As the dancer begins with some basic positioning of the body, she appears confident and connected to the rhythm. She's incorporating her arms choreographically in a way that's clear and appropriate and has a lot of clarity in her footwork in general. In these moments where the dancer needs to move a bit more quickly with a bit more precision, she really struggles to stay consistently connected to the rhythm. As she's kind of launching her arms backwards into the space and straightening through her legs, she's struggling to connect to the rhythm here and finding clarity in her movement. Overall she would benefit from being more grounded in her movement, keeping a soft bend in her knees, and finding more clarity in her movement overall. As the dancer performs this basic salsa step which locomotes her slightly to the left side, she really demonstrates a moment of clarity here. She's got a lot of nice movement in her pelvis, a soft bend in her knees, clarity in her footwork, as well as clarity in the incorporation of her arms choreographically. Overall, this is a real moment of shine for the dancer. She appears confident and connected to the rhythm. As the dancer performs this layout backwards where she's elevating her left leg and kind of standing on her right leg as a supporting leg, she would really benefit from bending this right knee quite a bit more to gain more stability, as well as a greater range of motion in the pelvis and of the working leg. She would also benefit from pushing her pelvis upwards, extending this left leg further upwards towards the sky, and finding a bit more clarity in the connection between her arms, her head, and her neck here.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Whereas if you drop that knee down to the left, he could kind of sit on top of that and then really explode for that knee. So it kind of brings his right hip into the wall.

His foot, his left foot does pop out. So this could be where this right knee is facing outwards. He could have maybe twisted that right knee inwards and drove the hip into the wall and done like a twist lock into that undercling. So it kind of brought his torso, his chest into that forearm and bicep and twisted it and then tried to dead point it that way. But he makes it and is still able to hold on even with the one foot cutting out. Again, just a really good positioning. You know, he makes this big move, then keeps his arm straight and shifts his weight underneath it. So that way he's not pulling through it or having to pull his body into a better position. He just kind of like sinks into the good position and then boosts his feet around. This little thing as he makes his first move, he kind of hits this up and his body weight is more to the right. So he's kind of gestoning this hand, but then he shifts his whole body to the left. So he can kind of be underneath it, not having to pull through it. Trying to be as straight below the hold as possible. And I was kind of cutting feet here, so this is me not the best thing but he's on a lot better hand holds See the whole Duke it quite jokey he doesn't make it the top of all Somebody he is turning a little tired And hey, that's where you know having that right right knee turned in to kind of save the fluff of him cutting could have a saved him some energy This next move is going to be kind of hard. So he's going up to this undercling. So that means he wants to be as far up and right as possible. So he's going to get his feet around. He does a really good job of walking his feet through and not just muscling through with his arms. You know, he's quite locked off right now. That's just to kind of hold the hold. He does a really good job walking his feet up and kind of twisting his knees and hips in and then doing a coordinated effort to move up. So he really does this move and this sequencing through his lower body first and then lets him transfer that good position to his upper body. Now I like this next move, he sets his heel, I kind of got the frame a little wrong, but he could put his toe on, but the toe is enough to force him to get further over to the right so he can stand up through it. But by setting the heel on here, he can kind of just pull straight down through the heel right away, and then pull through his arm to get up there. So the heel really lets him pull through, and almost gives him like a third arm to kind of be pulling with, instead of having to push with the feet. And it's a big enough hold that it really lets him like lock down on that heel.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Here he's able to twist his left leg in and out in isolation, quickly, efficiently, and on rhythm, as well as engage choreography in his arms and upper body. While the dancer is able to move quickly and efficiently with a lot of clarity in his choreography and engage his whole body, this is a moment where he struggles a little bit. He would benefit from a softening of the spine and the pelvis, which is lacking a significant range of motion, which is demonstrated in this sort of body roll. He would also benefit here from bending the knees and dropping the pelvis back more, which would help ground him to give him that full range of motion in his pelvis and up through his spine. As the dancer begins his performance, he demonstrates that he has an advanced understanding of the movement vocabulary as well as rhythmic embodiment. He is able to engage polyrhythm in his body, moving his upper body, in this case his hands, at a different rhythm and a different tempo than his lower body or his feet. He engages all parts of his body, his head, his torso, his legs, and his arms. However, he would benefit from a little bit more motion, particularly in the pelvis, and a softening of the spine to add an interesting additional dynamic to his movement. The dancer performs a turn around himself, which he's able to do quickly and efficiently, particularly thanks to the spotting of his head here. He also keeps his movements small and right underneath his shoulders and his pelvis, which helps him to move quickly. The dancer performs a series of increasingly quick salsa movements. He's able to really engage his arms and his lower body and really embody the rhythm throughout his entire body, which shows that he has an advanced understanding of the movement technique as well as the rhythmic embodiment here. He's able to move between different phrase work very quickly and efficiently. He maintains a nice bend in his knees and a dropping back the pelvis, which shows that he's grounded in his movements and keeps his movements small, quick, and clear, which helps him to move quickly.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She's also swinging her arms and they're not just swinging side to side but they do draw back behind her and then coming up. So really good use of the arms in that part. I'll say overall the stands did a really good job. I think this is a good basic set of choreography. One thing that helped a lot was the counting. So if you have a basic beginner class, either having the counts available or having the teacher count, I think it really helped for the dancer to connect with the music and make sure they're doing all the steps correctly and with the correct timing. So here she's doing a toe heel step again. Really good job. This is something I would teach my youngest students in tap class as they're going across the floor. So she's really good job bending her knees, getting that heel up off the floor and then dropping it down and accenting on the heel, as well as swinging her arms forward and back to go along with the music. So here she, after she twirls forward, she's doing a kick ball change, going backwards, which is nice. And it's really good that she's counting because it's, I think it'll help whoever is learning to make sure they're going, bop, bada, one and two, three and four, five and six. So it's right on the beat of the music. that time I noticed she right after she jumped out she slowly started to shift her arms to the right side so that way her weights will start to kind of move over so that way she can then step tap to the left. So really you have to kind of think you know what is happening next and not just think about what's happening in the moment when you want to shift your weight without being very bold about shifting your weight or just jumping on just one leg. If you're jumping on both you want to be able to shift easily and quickly. So here she's stepping out with the second position with both knees bent out and she does it I think three or four times and the first time was a really nice open so I would suggest that she continued to stay the same way. She started to make it smaller and so then her energy kind of went down because it got smaller so I would have opened it out and maybe if you get tired just go a little slower so go on the four counts instead of doing every two counts and make it a little longer so the music so the movement is a little more exaggerated. So these swings that she's doing, a lot of them are really simpler and right now she's going back and forth. I would suggest maybe turning around facing the other direction or just coming up further to the front but definitely I would give that a little more variety so it's not just still staying on this line going back and forth. So here she does a really good job with her sway back and forth. She's going sway one, two, sway three, four, then same side, seven, eight, sway two, three, four, same side. She's doing a really good job engaging her full body again using her arms as well as like traveling across the floor so she's using the full space that she has. So here the dancer is starting. One great thing is that she counted in so that just helps so that way whoever is learning is starting at the correct time so counting five six seven eight and then she's also helping to count with the music with the movement that she's doing so she's calling a tap together so she's stepping her foot out and then kind of sliding it in and then stepping with the other leg and sliding it in and she's also bending her knees so she's using her lower half of the body and she's not necessarily using her arms to dance but just to point out that that is what her leg is doing So here she's doing a toe heel step where she steps on her toe, drops her heel, then other leg steps toe, drop heel, and she's doing a good job at using her space. She travels around and she says moving in a circle and then she reverses back after she comes around forward. She's also swinging her arms and keeping her full body engaged as well. So really good swivel again. She's decided to point her fingers down to the floor and bending her knees nicely and then just staying up on her toes as she twists her body keeping her chest area straight but then the bottom half is twisting. So here she just did a step tap side to side. She was also swaying her arms nicely side to side and then jumping out. When you're teaching this, it's important again to understand weight shift. So if she's going to step back out with her right foot, she wants to make sure when she jumps out, even though it may look like she's jumping out and her weight is even, she kind of wants to either slightly lean or just have in her mind that I'm going to put more of my weight onto my left side so that my right side is free to move.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

It's important that the climber always glances down to make sure that she makes an accurate foot placement before starting to climb. When the climber was making the right hand to come into place at a match, we can see the climber's center of gravity has dropped because of the sudden disconnection of the right foot on the hold. It's important that the climber continues to apply pressure at both of the feet when making the transition of the right hand. The climber transferring over the hand to bring it over to a match at the undercling the right foot has come out of place This the climber will have to sustain from falling by holding tightly onto the grips The climber right now is approaching the wall to assess the first hold. This is a start hold so the climber eventually will have to start with placing both of the hands onto the same hold. And bringing the right hand to come into place over the left side of the hold tells me that the climber must keep the right hand in place to the hold when performing the move and releasing the left hand first. The climber is sending the left hand over to the next hold. The foot positioning was slightly shifted. In this one the climber rolled the toe inwards onto the hold and is mostly applying pressure with the inner area of the toe. Now the knee has come inwards to create a knee drop to raise the hips to make it easy on not applying yet pressure onto the left hand grip as the climber continues to adjust it. We can see how the climber this time has brought the palm to be facing up and slide the fingers behind the lip of the hold. This one still sustaining onto a jug. This type of hand placement is called an undercling and this one can be applied with more force as the climber is able to apply the thumb on the outside lip of the hold. When the climber creates pressure then the climber will be able to close the grip and pinch onto the hold and after transfer over the weight by leaning back as the climber right now has the arm extended making it easy to sustain. Once the climber has placed the right foot, has lifted the left foot to come into place at this block. This is a larger foothold so the climber is placing the ball of the foot over the corner of the hold. So that the climber later, when transitioning out left, which is the next hold at reach, the climber will be able to roll the toe over the hold onto this small space. As we can see the climber chooses to keep the hands side by side and is placing both of the hands onto the same hold. The type of hold she is sustaining is called the jug as the climber is able to wrap the hands around the lip of the hold. Both of the hands position into the same hold, this is called matching. Now we can see the climber has brought the left foot to come into place first. And once the climber lifts the right foot off the mat, then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So because the hold is a pinch in a slanted position, typically it's very difficult to hang on to this hold just by itself. So the best way to hang on to it is actually by hanging back and over to the right of it. And this is what we call a layback position. And a layback position is really good, especially when you're able to reinforce it with the use of your legs. So here we can see that the Clamor is doing a good job of making sure that a lot of his body weight is placed on that leg. And he's doing his good job of pressing back on that foothold. And this helps to keep his body over to the right of that handhold. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring his right hand into the next handhold And in this position he is still hanging on with that left-hand pinch And then he is still or he was able to switch his feet so the right foot is on that starting foothold now So one of the things I like about this position here is the climber was able to keep his right foot on that Foothold right there which helps to reinforce Keeping tension on that foot and this allows him to get really good control of his hands and where they're being placed in this movement But one thing I am noticing that with this left flagging foot It's kind of being in a bent position being pulled away from the wall So this only helps to pull the rest of his body away from the wall as well Which works against him I'm so I would always encourage climbers to make sure that their flagging foot is in a very intentional manner kind of straight leg and Pressed up against the wall. So that way it helps to press their body closer to the wall", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So he should have been tapping his right foot in. Now he's tapping his left foot in. So he was supposed to turn around, stepping five, six, seven, tapping eight, or stepping on his left foot, right foot, left foot, tapping on his right foot on eight. But he extended instead his right foot outward on count eight and then tapped his left foot on count one. So actually he's going to be a count late now because he should be stepping outward on count one. And instead he's tapping his feet together on count one here. The dancer is doing extra movements with his head looking to the side and then the left side the right side Kind of on a diagonal up sometimes on a diagonal down these extra movements with his head are just that they're extra movements And they're not necessary and they're also not aligned with the rest of his spine So it looks like his head is moving independently than the rest of his body. I mean in this way it is distracted The dancer completes this turn directionally correct again. Before he was traveling to his right when he was facing back, so it was also the right of our screen. Now he turns around and continues to go to his right. The turning around was replacing moving to his left as he turned around his left shoulder. And now he's again moving towards his right, which is now our left side of the screen since he's facing forward. So those directions are correct. The dancer executes this turn better because before he was facing the back of the room and Traveling to his left and our left side of the screen since he was facing the back of the room So now when he turns around on which was as if he was going to his right and our right side of the room Upon completion of that turn he should be traveling again towards his left Which is now on our right side of the screen because he's facing forward and that is what he's doing here He's directionally going the correct way. He went to his left. He turned around his right shoulder and now he's going to his left again So directionally that is appropriate This moment right here is a clear indication of which direction his hip is going. We see that his hips are pointing out to our right side of the screen, or his left side, also indicated by the angle in which his torso is at. But also at the same time, he's stepping with that same foot. He's stepping with his left foot. So, his hips shouldn't be going out to the left, they really should be going out to his right. And instead, his hips or his vertebrae would be tilted the opposite direction here. And this will be a repetitive correction. Every time he's stepping with his left foot, he's also moving his hips to the left, which is incorrect. It should be the opposite way his hips are going. And I won't continue to repeat this correction, but this is gonna be a correction that he should be applying throughout this basic bachata dance step. . We see here again the dancer stepping with his right foot. He's moving his hips to the right when they should be moving to his left and he is also tilting his head. We see this head tilt here which is not necessary because it's causing his spine to be on an angle and instead his spine should be in a perfectly vertically straight line. The only part of his spine that is moving any which way is should be his hips moving to the left. The dancer missed a count here. This was count eight, and on count eight, his right foot should have been tapping close into his left. Right now, he's already starting his next bachata dance step and stepping outward. He's a count early now. So it's count eight, his feet should be together. Instead, it's count eight and his feet are apart, which really shouldn't be happening to the next first count or count one of the next measure. So now from here on out, he's going to be off rhythm because he did not do a complete full revolution. He should have still turned on a full four counts. Just like any bachata step that he's doing here, it takes four counts. He's walking one, two, three, touching four. And even when he's turning around, he should be walking one, two, three, touching a four or turning on five, six, seven, touching eight. Either way, it's four counts, but here he does it only in three counts, which is gonna make him now off rhythm moving forward. The dancer sometimes looks with his eyes downward and this is not necessary. He can be focusing straight outward the entire time so that he doesn't change the alignment of his neck, which is the top of his spine. Instead, his spine would be perfectly aligned if his head remains stacked on top of his vertebrae and not looking downward. His head continues to look around in multiple directions which is not necessary and are extra movements through his neck that are a bit distracting. The dancer's hands are in fists and that way they're holding some tension and the dancer shouldn't be having fists or his hands in fists when he is executing this movement and in the way that he is moving his arms it's looking as if he's running or running a motor moving them forward and back or rowing a boat and really his arms should or his hands should be more relaxed not in a fist and be in front of him instead of at his sides as they are here. The dancers arm movement here again is awkward It's also extended out to his side and if he was to be down to the partner if that's what he is Practicing his arm movement should actually be or his arm positioning should be a little forward in front of him because the dancer and Or the other dancer like his partner would be linking arms with him and if his arm is extended directly out to the side his partner would have to reach all the way forward to be Holding it or grasping his hand So his hand needs to be a bit On the diagonal in front of him so that each partner would be extending their arms and equal distance and it would be a true Partnership right here his arm extended outward is not Correct, and it would be very difficult for any partner to be holding his hand and dancing with him The dancer did a good job of turning around from facing the back of the room to facing the front of the room and remaining in rhythm and going directionally the way he was supposed to. So he made this transition here smoothly and executed it correctly. When the dancer moves his arms upward like this it's a bit awkward because he doesn't have a partner that he is dancing with. This part would be a ghost partner as if they're not present. So perhaps he's practicing this arm movement as if he is turning a partner or holding their hand but because the partner is not there it's awkward and it's not meant to be practiced like that. It's also difficult for him to assess how high or low his arm should be because there is not a partner with a specific height that he is dancing with there. So this extra arm movement that he's doing right here is not necessary especially because he is dancing as a solo here. The dancer right now is dancing on rhythm, walking one, two, three to his left side and then bringing and touching his right foot into his left on count four, and then walking five, six, seven to his right side and touching his left foot into his right foot on count eight. So he's walking one, two, three, touch four, five, six, seven, touch eight, and this is in proper rhythm. The dancer also completes the right amount of steps when he turns around. He walks around in a circle three times and then taps his foot on the fourth count, which takes up the same amount of space as each of these bachata basic steps that he's doing. So he does the proper amount of foot steps on this turn. The only thing is he is a count behind in music still because of the mistake he made prior before when he turned around in a circle and instead of taking four steps he took five steps. So now he will perpetually be a count late in the music unless he perfects it and fixes it. The dancer is also now going to be directionally traveling to his left, which is incorrect. He should be traveling directionally to his right because right before he turned, he was traveling to his right, one, two, three, touch, four. And that turn that he did, which would have been a turn around his left shoulder, which is what he did, should have been five, six, seven, and touching in on eight. And that would be replacing him directionally moving to his left. So he moved to his right, one, two, three, touch, four, and turned around his left, going to the left, five, six, seven, touch, eight, which means he really should now be going to the right side of the room. Instead, he added this extra step in here where he stepped out on his right foot on eight and then touched his left foot in on one. So now he's going to be a count behind in the music, stepping out on two instead of stepping out on one with his left foot. And he's going to be traveling to his left, which is really not correct. He should be traveling to his right and being one count ahead of where he is now. The dancer's arms are twisting as he's going up and down, as if he's lifting weights. But instead, his arms shouldn't be turning from side to side. They should be in front of him and moving up and down and not twisting. So his arms are too far to the side of him, where they should be in front of his body and they should not be twisting at all. When the dancer is stepping with his foot, he's also rolling through his ribs and vertebrae a bit. And this is not necessary. Really, he just should be stepping and moving his hips horizontally to the other side. But his vertebrae should remain aligned and just upright. He doesn't need any of these extra superfluous movements that he's doing through his vertebrae when he's stepping. He's basically stepping and doing a bit of an overcurve, like moving his body through a wave, but he doesn't need to do that at all. Again, the dancer here is looking downward. His eyes are focused downward. Not necessary. His eyes should be focused outward, straightforward. And here the dancer is stepping with his right foot and his hips are pulling to his right, but again it should be the opposite direction. So instead when he's stepping with his right foot as he is here, his hips should be pulling away towards his left. The dancer also sticks out his neck. He's moving his head forward here when he's turning. So he's scrunched up at his neck and then his head is tilting backwards a bit. And this poking out of the neck and extension of the cervical vertebrae, meaning that his spine, the top of his spine, his neck backwards, makes his body not aligned. So we see here his spine is hunching forward, his neck is moving outward, or his chin is moving outward, and then his neck is on an arch backwards. So he's creating this angle in his spine that is a bit zigzagged. And instead, his spine really should be in a straight line. The dancer is not moving his hips properly or directionally correct. So when he's stepping with his left foot, his hips should actually be pulling to the right. Right here he's pulling them to his left. So his hips should be pulling in the opposite direction in which he steps.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She does some steps in place but very casually and we can't really tell if it's going to be the end of the routine or not it just seems like her energy is dying down. The dancer could make these steps that she's doing more exciting by traveling further in the space, traveling further out and then crossing over and further out and crossing over. She's executing the steps correctly and it's executing the number of steps correctly, but again, it's not very exciting. And part of the reason why it's not very exciting is because she's staying in the same square of space instead of traveling and using the studio that she has at her disposal. Although the dancer has very fluid movements in both her arms and her hips, both of these movements can be even bigger, even grander to make her movement more exciting. It's technically correct, it's just not done to the extent that it can be. So she could be moving her hips further side to side, moving her arms further up and down so that there is just a greater range of motion when she's dancing. The dancer could finish the routine better by facing completely forward, not already turning her head to the side to face the people who are filming, but instead being very purposeful about facing forward and ending that way, focused. The dancer's turn is very good. We see that she whips her head around and that's very evident in how her hair, her ponytails, flying behind her. So she's able to complete this turn so well because she's whipping her head around quickly and that in turn is turning her body around as well and we see the consequence of that is her hair flying in the wind. Dancer has good leg movement here, moving her legs up and down as she's tapping her toes forward. But again, she can engage her hips and her shoulders more, similar to my comment at the beginning of the routine, so that the dance step here is more exciting and that so she's not overall dancing a bit monotone. The dancer has nice execution in her arms. Every time she steps with one foot, her opposite arm is higher than the other. So when she steps with her right foot, here we see that her left arm is higher and she's alternating this with each step she takes. Her arm movement is very fluid in these alternations and she's very coordinated from being able to use opposite arm to leg. Again, the dancer is very contained. She's elegant when she's moving. She's dancing very easily, but the steps that she's doing are very small. She can make these steps bigger, travel further to be more exciting. The dancer is appropriately pausing in the center on counts four and eight. She extends outward one, two, comes back on three. She holds four, extends outwards five, six, comes back on seven, holds eight. These pauses on four and eight are grounding her in the rhythm, and that is the appropriate rhythm for salsa dancing. The dancers also has fluid hip movements when she's stepping with one foot her hip is going in the opposite direction when she stepped on the right foot her hips are moving backwards to her left. They're alternating her hips right and left again coordinated with whatever her feet are doing.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Again, you want to catch and shoot. You got to be very aggressive because of defense, but love that his feet are apart. I love that he's going straight up. Great lift of the ball up. And again, it may be a little bit to the right of his head. It's not too bad. And let's get that shooting elbow in under the ball. Looks like it's a little bit out. But beautiful extension, he's got beautiful technique and form on the release. Great extension, great flexion, snapping of the wrists, fingers point down, guide hand on the side, beautiful extension of the hips. But I know, I know he can jump higher. Again, standing straight up, waiting for the pass. Let's step in and meet this pass. I love that left-right, one-two step, meet the pass, get those hands and arms out ready to catch and shoot. Again, brings the ball down really low. Let's keep it up high. Here I love how he's got his feet apart, one foot in front of the other. But he's just really counting on just being able to jump from a standstill position. It'd be better if you're moving and stepping into that pass to get power to lift. But as he raises it, it's not too bad. I'd get these elbows in a little bit, but beautiful extension of the hips. He's going up on the balls of his feet. You can see the ball sitting on the palm of his hand softly, which is good. And, you know, that elbow looks like it's out a little bit. Let's bring it under the ball right here. Again, let's meet this pass. The reason you want to do this so a defender doesn't step between you and the ball and steal it. So let's step in. Let's step left, right and catch this ball. Catch and shoot. Again, in this view, great extension of the shooting elbow. It's high. Let's keep it there. Great flexion of the wrist. Fingers go down. Guide hand stays on the side. Again, let's bring that guide elbow in so it's 90 degree. Again, he raises the ball high. That's beautiful, great 90-degree angle of the shooting arm. I'd get that elbow in a little bit here. But he starts to elevate straight up. He got the ball up high, which is really good. It's hard to block that shot. A little bit, maybe, some people say he may be bringing it back a little bit beyond his forehead, but I think that looks really good. Here, we'd love more elevation, use of the legs on this shot, good extension of the shooting arm, snapping of the wrists, guide hands on the side, let's get that elbow in. It's pretty good though, not bad. Again, ideally, I'd be really stepping aggressively into this pass. He sort of just waits for it to come to him, sort of like aggressively stepping one, two, plant, catch, and shoot. He's straight up, waits for the ball to come to him. Again, in a game situation, it's going to be a turnover because a defense is going to run right in front of you and steal it. So meet your pass. It's ideally recommended that you practice that in this drill. Again, beautiful flexion here, extension of the shooting arm. You can see this guide hand elbow go out. Let's bring it down underneath or bring it in. Just bring it in so it's underneath the hand. Great extension of the hips. Here in this mid-range jumper, in that egocentric view, beautiful extension of the shooting arm, which is his right arm and hand. Love the snapping of the wrist and the fingers are down as the ball leaves his hand. Shooting palm or the non-shooting guide hand, that palm is facing in. I might bring this elbow down a little bit so it's pointing more to the ground. You can see that it's kind of pointing out. So let's just bring this elbow in a little bit. But love the hand placement here of the guide hand. Pretty good lift. I feel like he could get more lift if he would kind of step into this pass, one, two, catch and shoot. But a good extension here. A nice touch. Here, you know, just takes his time, brings it down low, steps back. So, you know, I just would recommend just, you know, this is a skill where you just can work on your footwork and catching and shooting and elevating. Again, on the release, let's hold the follow-through up, come down balanced, low, cushion your fall with bent knees and on the balls of your feet. Follow through, I would, you know, I would recommend that he holds his follow through, that he brings both arms down. Let's hold it up there until it hits the rim. Again, come down, be balanced, knees bent, hold that follow through, extend that shooting arm, guide hand. Again, that right elbow is kind of moving to the outside. Let's get it under. Get that follow through straight to the face in the basketball. Again, beautiful guide hand. Let's get that elbow in. Here, he catches it, you kind of see his feet are just kind of, you know, not, I would have that, you know, that left step with that left foot and pull the right leg in, but on top of the footwork, he kind of drops the ball, if you will, he kind of brings it down low instead of keeping it up high. Like he needs to keep it up high and take it right into his shot. Again, I really feel like as he's waiting for this pass, he's kind of standing straight up to make it more game-like and real-like. He needs to be down in a ready position, I call it, with his shooting hand ready to catch and shoot. Here, he's straight up, feet are together, not ready to receive a catch and shoot. My recommendation, if that's what we're looking for.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So in this position we can see that they are hanging on with their right hand with the right arm in a very straight position which is a really good thing to see. And then with that they're also using the left foot which is going to be the opposite point of contact compared to their right hand and with that that does help to stabilize the body between those two points. So this is a really good position to see from the climber to start this climb. And then what we can see happening here is we can see the climbers kind of rotating their body so that the left side of the hip kind of starts to go up towards the wall and the reason for that is it helps to bring up that left hand that they're trying to get into the position. So this is a really good thing to see from the climber to start their climb. And so here we can see the climber was able to switch their feet, so now their right foot is on the foothold right here. And one of the key important things about that is that it does allow the climber to rotate their body so that their right side of the body gets closer to the wall. And one of the main reasons why this is important is because now they want to transfer the bodyweight directly underneath their left arm, so then that way they can have a better control of the position on that left arm, and then this way their right hand has an opportunity to move into the next position. So this is pretty good to see from the climber that they were able to rotate around that right foot to try and get in a better position to complete the next move.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She executes this movement very particularly and meticulously when she's reaching her hands to her head and her hips, alternating right and left. She does this very clearly. She does not add any extra steps in this or any directions that would be unclear. Her hands go directly to her head and her waist and switch directly other hand to her head and her waist. The dancer is swiveling her hips greatly here, that's showing a lot of stylistic elements and that's wonderful. The dancer just did an amazing job changing level from a high level to a medium level by bending her knees greatly. She had her head reached down to where her knees was. This was a sudden change that she executed wonderfully, especially because she initiated that drop down from her head. So by moving her head quickly down like that, her upper body followed, you know, her neck, her shoulders, her chest then followed downward. And this was a great change of level. The dancer's spot again is excellent. She's doing a full revolution around and she's able to do that quickly because her eyes are spotting exactly forward where she wants to end that turn. The dancer executed this turn seamlessly she completed one and a quarter one and a half revolutions where she started Facing the left side of the room and then rotate it all the way around back to the left side and then back further forward So I was about one and a quarter revolutions and she was able to do that So seamlessly so swiftly because she placed her weight onto her toes She lifted her heels when she was turning which didn't cause her any Friction that would stop her there were no boundaries or barriers to stop the momentum of her turn and she also used her eyes To spot the front of the room, which is where this turn is ending So between what she's doing with her eyes in her head and what she's doing with her weight on her toes She's able to execute this turn wonderfully In this opening position that the dancer is executing, it can be improved if her front foot is on a higher arch, meaning that she's standing on tippy toes. But if she was to further her tippy toe position by moving her weight higher up onto the ball of her foot with her heel higher up off the ground, that would help. And also what would help is if her heel was reaching further in alignment over her big toe. Right now her heel is kind of leaning a bit towards her pinky toe, so if she really concentrated on putting the weight of her foot into the metatarsals and the undering of her big toe instead of her pinky toe, that would help her remain balanced in this position and would be an aesthetically aligned position. The dancer finishes strongly in a pose. She is frozen and we know the dance is done because she is not moving. She is also freezing with energy. So even though she's stationary, not moving, the energy is coming all the way down out of the tips of her toes and all the way up out of the tips of her hands. Her energy in her head is also pulling straight upward. So she has energy in her legs on the diagonals, downward diagonals, energy in her arms and the upward diagonals and energy from her head straight upward. Her hips are moving easily, they're moving smoothly, and she's basically gliding across the floor because she's pressing her weight onto her toes, which is allowing her hips to have this movement back and forth, and for her to glide from feet together to her leg out like this, and she's gonna cross it back forward, mostly because she's able to maintain her weight towards her toes. She is able to move her arms quickly to different positions because she is not tensing her arms. Rather, she's loosening her body so that her arms can swing sideways up and down with ease. And this is happening because she is not tense. If she was to be tense, her whole body would be stiff, and she wouldn't be able to move this quickly to multiple positions as she is currently doing. The dancer is able to change direction here so quickly, moving her feet and different patterning across the floor because she is relying her weight on her toes and her heels are constantly lifted. We see here in this frozen frame that her heels are off the ground, her feet are actually at an angle because she is standing more so on her toes. The dancer is able to execute this backbend step with great energy and very quickly because she straightens her arm that is resting on the floor. So her hand and palm of her left hand is flat on the floor and she's pushing upward to straighten that arm and how she's also able to do that is pushing her back up as a means of pushing her hips to the ceiling. So because her hips are pushing to the ceiling that is helping her arm also straighten upwards towards the ceiling. The dancer is able to get down to this floor position without hurting herself, without injuring herself, because she rotates her knee to face the front. At first, she gets low by bending her legs. She then changes her knee position from facing the floor to facing forward. That way, she can sit down on her side of her thigh. And she's also using her left hand as a foundation, as a root in the ground, so that she can get into that position without any banging around on the floor in a way that's very neat and very consolidated. When her arms are punching downward like this, she could do a better job of being meticulous so that we can tell if the choreography is meant for her to have straight arms, slightly arced arms, bent arms, but it's not really clear if her arms are supposed to be straight down or at an angle because they're in an in-between territory where her arms are slightly bent and kind of in a circular arc and not exactly straight. Again, the dancer drops down with great energy going from a standing position to this bent low position. She's able to do this well. She's bending her knees and really pushing her entire weight downward, changing her center of gravity by really having this wide stance in her legs, which is helping her remain balanced and change that level quickly. That's wonderful. The dancer does a good job in extending her arm completely straight outward. We see even her pointer finger is pointing diagonal into that front left corner of the room. What would make this step even better, especially as an opening step of a dance routine, is if she also extended this movement with energy from her shoulder outward, as if she's yearning for that corner or reaching as far as she possibly could. So her arm is technically correct in that it is straight, but from an artistry standpoint or a stylist standpoint, it could be even better if she was to extend outward from her shoulder forward as well, as if she's desperately trying to reach something in that corner. Her arms do a great job of pushing forward and outward, especially we see that she's holding her hands in fists. She's making this energy tight so when she's pushing forwards and outward the direction is clear and with much force. The dancer does a great job of bursting her energy upward. Here she's creating a V with her arms and this is a perfect angle, this is perfect execution. She has energy coming out of her fingertips. We could feel and see it emitting on these diagonals. Something that would help make this movement even better is that if she maintained her balance slightly more and she could do this by closing her rib cage. Right now her ribs are exposed as her chest is leaning forward or pushing forward. But if she was to wrap her rib cage inward to close her rib cage towards her belly button, this would help her remain standing tall without losing her balance. All of the dancers and movements are very sharp. They're linear. There's no question about where she is in space, where her arms are aiming or what direction she is facing. She's dancing very clearly. The dancer does a wonderful job of leaning backwards in this step where she's looking upwards. Her arms are going outwards on a diagonal, so diagonally upward and out, and her chest is facing upwards as well. Her head is leaned backwards, her neck is exposed, and leaning backwards like this is giving her more room to lift her leg higher and her leg is leading or leading up into the air with ease because she's creating space for it by leaning backwards. The dancer is punching upwards with great energy and we see this well in her hands and fists and also her knee is mimicking her arms or her fists. Her arms are punching upward with great energy and her knee and her leg is doing the exact same thing. A minor note for styling, the dancer could drop further down here in level so she could bend her knees even more so that her whole position, her whole body would be lower in space which would show a more dynamic shift in level from when she was standing up tall and high to now this middle level position where she's bending her knees. The dancer shimmying her shoulders with great energy and style. When the dancer is circling her right arm around counterclockwise over her head, she is doing this well, but the step could be even better if she was to straighten her arm all the way right here. Her elbow is slightly bent, and if she's also aware of her wrist, making sure she's not bending at the wrist too much. Right here, her wrist is bent so that her line breaks, and her wrist being bent is making her fingers point outward instead of extending from that line further upward.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And with his arm being straight as he swings backwards and continues to swing back, it's going to just act as a bigger lever and it's going to leave all this room for his feet to swing out and his whole hips to kind of come further and further from the wall, sending all of his weight flying away from the wall. So it starts in a pretty good position. His arms are nice and straight. The dino up to this green hold. So his movement here is gonna be pulling himself as close to the wall. And when his hips are as close to the wall, then jumping up to the dino. So by not bending his arms, that's pretty good. So he should be able to kind of pendulum up, give himself a couple of practice swings, get his hips close to the wall, and then jump. He does something kind of funny. He's kind of twisting his right knee in, which when he kind of practices, it kind of sends him out a little bit. So we can see that as he's jumping out, as he's jumping up, that knee twist isn't really bringing his hip closer to the wall. It's kind of sending him off at this kind of angle. So when he jumps out, he's going to be kind of shooting outward from the wall as he moves upwards. And so he won't be as close to the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Here I would tell them to drop their weight and their pelvis even further in the ground as they move their legs in and out. That would create a more different level of variations, which again creates more dynamic quality within the movement, which dynamics make it very interesting to watch it is. I would encourage this dancer, they have really great energy throughout their extremities, but they're missing their center. So they're not rotating that rib cage, they're not rotating those hips, right? And by doing that, it makes it feel stiff, even though they're doing all this amazing work. So embodiment from not only just the extremities, but from head to toe and through your center is super important. I would encourage the dancer to roll their shoulders forward, up and back right now. Their shoulders look hunched up to their ears. I would encourage the dancer to be very precise about where they place their arms. It looks like they're doing a little bit of a heel toe at this moment before, so making sure they know when to be on their heels versus when to be on their ball to the feet, that kind of attention to detail and advanced choreography takes it to the next level. I would encourage the dancer to send their hips back even further, but again, open up their chest so they can be grounded, right, and be able to move really quickly and have this great range of motion, which we see with this dancer. But then they're also able to exude confidence and have this rib cage articulation here.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He does a little kind of chasse, just gallops to the side. First he went to the left and now he's on his right side. Right now his weight is on his right foot. The arms were swinging up and back. So again, just really nice way of getting into the groove of the music and keeping the energy going. So here he does a body roll coming back. I think maybe this may be my only just critique, maybe just add a little bit more body roll. So really pushing from the knees, then to the hips, into the full spine of the back, and then to the head as you bring your arms up and around. So that can be a real like snakey movement that you do with your body, if your body is capable of doing that much movement. So again he did a nice turn around towards his left, turned it a little salsa step, just really nice movement, nice flow of his movement, great energy, just everything is coming together nicely. And as he steps forward and back with his left foot, he does a nice shimmy with his shoulders, keeping the body half pretty still, but then the top half has really nice movement. So the music picks up, so does his energy and his movement. He just takes a little step with his right and left and he's kind of like toe-tapping his foot so just pop pop pop and then also a little shimmy with his hands and arms. So again just nice matching the energy of the music. The rhythm and tempo matches his movement as well. So here another great movement where he spins around. His left foot is crossed behind him. All of his weight right now is on his right foot, so he's standing firmly on that leg. His arms are what I consider a dab, so that left arm is bent in front. The right arm is reaching up to the ceiling. So just really nice control because he's able to stop his body and then go back around into the next movement. So here he stepped over with his right foot, crossing over his left, and then came back around, did a little twist, and then body roll up. And his body roll went from the bottom to the top. So just really nice work with moving and putting everything together and transitioning between steps. So here he steps side, his body is facing the right, but his head is still facing the front. He does a really nice twist with his lower body as you see his heels are both facing the front of the room as well as his hip is pushing forward and his arms are up over his head so just really nice overall movement. So this one the dancer starts stepping side to his right and he's just stepping out with his right leg and stepping together but he adds a little extra in his back and his arms are moving and swinging to the beat nicely so just a really nice clean opening. This is a really great example. I could actually teach this and perform it just off of his energy. He was able to do each step clearly, but the energy really, really helped. He was really in the pocket of the music, which helps with the style of dance. So everything I would say, just really nice work. He was not afraid to move his body. He wasn't afraid to use the space and spin around, use all of his arms. So just really, really great execution. So here he did a little footwork with his right foot. It kind of tapped out and in and then he hit the back of his left leg with his right arm and then he goes into a body roll. So just really nice footwork again with the music and just staying on rhythm and keeping the energy. So here he just did a nice spin around. I love that he was able to get around and just control his body to get around right on the correct beat. So here he does a kind of a square step but adds a little salsa elements to it. So he crosses with his left foot first and just steps left right left right around in a square. So again really nice movement nice beat to the music and just really good energy overall. And then here he takes a step with his left foot and crosses back with his right. And he does a little arm shake with his hand. His hand is up in an L shape. And his fingers kind of do a little shake in the air.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I would also encourage the dancer again to plie or to bend their knees to be more grounded in this movement So it flows and it looks a little less awkward So the grounding motion will help that and help the flow throughout the body I would encourage the dancer to just take a half a second before they start this side step. They're a little bit off of the music, so taking that moment to just breathe and ground themselves before they start this side step will be extremely helpful to make sure that they're on the beat. This dancer does a really great job of having like really sharp and staccato movements. I would encourage them to think about how they can be more energetic in their movement and also be overly dramatic while they take up space. This would give more dynamic quality to this already really great sharp and staccato movements that we're seeing. I would encourage the dancer to really think about their neck in this and the alignment of it to make sure that their shoulders are either erect and their neck is sitting right on top of these shoulders. And I will also to encourage them to roll these shoulders up, back, up, back, and down, up, back, and down so they have a more wide open chest and wide open base to work from. This would encourage the dancer's dynamic quality and also give the illusion that they're taking up more space throughout the dance. I would encourage the dancer to sink a little bit deeper into their plie and engage their hips in a circular motion, not just kind of the right now they're kind of going side to side back and forth. This would give them more dynamic quality.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The music is playing very low, so it's difficult to hear. However, from what I do hear, she's not dancing in rhythm with that music. She's dancing a lot slower than that music. The dancers need to be pulling in oppositional directions more. So although the dancers are far apart here in width, which is good, the dancer in the pink should be pulling further backwards so that their arms are really taut in how they're linking. The dancer is doing a good job of meeting her feet on the triple step. So when she came forward to the front left diagonal of the screen, she moved her right foot, then her left foot, then her right foot again, three steps, triple step, or one, two, three. And in that second step, her left foot met her right foot in the center. The dancer's arm is a bit bent when she is spinning and she can extend more from the elbow higher. The dancer's eye focus is very good. She's looking in the direction of where her body is opening and facing. So when her body is facing to her left, she's also looking in that direction and looking towards her arms that she's extending as well. The dancer is also standing in a nice wide stance here, which is allowing her more mobility in her upper body because she is stable in her lower body. The dancer is doing a good job of making eye contact with her partner. Her partner's face is clearly in her line of vision. She's staring straight ahead at him. The dancer extends her arms well when she moves them away from her center. She is extending them in straight lines. The dancers are mirroring each other while so when the dancer in the pink uses her right foot, the dancer in the black uses his left foot. They're facing each other with their bodies angled towards each other's shoulders angled towards each other, hips angled towards each other and their feet are mirroring each other. However, now that the dancer is moving to a greater extent, she's looking downward. The dancer's lower body is in her view. The majority or the rest of his face isn't in her view anymore. So she needs to raise her focus. Her chin should be parallel to the floor instead of pointed at an angle downward. And she should still be looking at her partner who is straight in front of her.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So a lot of testy angles here, if you had motion sickness you would be easily affected watching this one. Despite the imbalance and the mistake, the player is doing a good job at just keeping the ball always on the move. It's touch, step almost all the way, so they're definitely doing their best to push the tempo on this one. Just no real structure to it. Just a touch on the surfaces of the foot and the variety. Definitely the highest amount of variety we've seen in terms of touch type across any video. But no real track that they're adding the variety on. It's just variety in the touch which is just causing the ball to do movements almost like a rumba at the moment. Just random directions and zooming around changing directions. But yeah a lot of variety in there. So with this one here we just see the player has moved the ball from here over to their right. And they've used the bottom of the foot to do this in a motion that has increased the distance between both feet. So they've opened up the stance with more of a pull away. This one can be tricky because the balance, and especially since the player has been moving forward, the balance can be knocked off. We look at this super wide now. It's easy for this player to move forward because of this line here. So not something that I would advise or say is an orthodox turn type. But the player has been doing well to just roll with the punches, go with the flow here, and keep the ball moving with a minimum one step between touches. Here we see the players try to roll it with the bottom of the right foot in this direction and while the ball is rolling and this right foot hits the floor, this left foot comes across to the position that it's in now and the ball kind of rolls through the legs and what the player would probably have tried to do would have been to twist it around afterwards and continue to dribble in a different direction but what we see here is the ball rolls in and this right leg kind of blocks it from rolling across so it gets stuck. The player doesn't realise until the last second he's brought his foot in front trying to allow it to roll through but there is a small breakdown in what has happened here, probably due to the player maybe being slightly off balance because they've just turned this corner at a very tight angle. And now we can see the ball is in the air and the player is juggling the ball So maybe Maybe the player is just trying to freestyle Because it's not dribbling and even the dribbling is kind of not dribbling. It's just High volume of touches and the players trying to just get a high volume of touches in this one So I would like to know what the instructions are here Again, just a lot more spinning up here. If you're just looking through the ego lens here, you might start to get a little bit dizzy. Hopefully, the player straightens up a little bit and starts taking it across distances versus the stoppy, starty, spinny, freestyling kind of touches that we're seeing so far. Again just to touch on the erratic side of this we're seeing the player completely airborne right now Jumping up in the air Ball behind them. I think they're trying to do a rainbow flick, but didn't quite come off a rainbow flick would have seen the ball Come over their head and land somewhere in front of them But yeah, I'm not sure whether it's just a headset being on or maybe off balance or having trouble with the perception of where the ball is but Kind of getting dizzy watching this one a little bit So in this video we're going to be looking at dribbling. It looks like this is going to be more of a freestyle dribbling video versus one of the videos we may see where players are weaving in and out through different cones on a different kind of a track. So we will still assess the fluidity, look at different surfaces of the feet that are being used, the dribbling technique, the stance, centre of gravity, ball speed and the tempo of the touches. If there are any repetitive challenging sequences, we will look at the steps between the touches and the tempo of those and then just any moves that are maybe breaking down fluidity or maybe unorthodox, that are maybe not advised or don't add positively to what the player is trying to achieve here. And we see here the opposite direction opposite foot, but same idea Left foot is pull the ball out here, and we see a very wide stance the balance going to be affected and We see again another stumble forward so not a move to recommend on the dribble Got to be careful with that one especially if you're trying to Continue to move forward with it, or if you don't have a plan for following it up And then as we can see resulting from that stance that can knock her balance off, the player completely bent forward. And now we're getting probably the first view of a touch from the upside down in all of the videos so far. So I'm not really sure what the idea is with With the overall structure in the overall purpose that the player has in mind again just Freestyling, but the ball is now just going in random directions and player is trying to take a touch after every step, but it is a bit erratic and a bit Loose and just a bit unpredictable And yeah, just not quite sure what the idea is here So with the space the player is very limited in terms of the speed that they can Gather on this dribble because these distances are very small. It looks like They're trying to stay within This box or at least just around the outsides if they are turning so just a couple of pull pushes V turns L turns here on the spot player trying to add some variety But it's difficult to kind of see dribbling quality When they're just kind of pulling and pushing pulling and pushing and twisting with the ball in such a tight space so starting off we see the players being kind of doing somewhat of a zigzag motion with what we call tic tocs or bells or foundations where the ball is just moved from inside to inside alternating touches and just kind of also on the step with the touch and just here we can see the players doing a bit of a step over turn right foot knocking the ball just efficiently around the corner of this cone left leg and coming around so now we have a gap between the two feet which the ball has kind of went through and the player will turn and proceed to dribble in another direction", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This is the most efficient way of undoing a foot switch because the climber is first applying pressure to the left toe coming into the hold before releasing the left foot from its place. The climber dropping the right toe had applied significant pressure onto the left foot as well as the grips. So quickly the climber has glanced down at the wall to bring the right toe to come into place at a new stance bringing it as a high foot placement where the climber places a toe over the edge of the hold. Once the climber is able to create pressure then we'll be able to release one of the limbs to the next move. For a second the climber in swinging the right foot out, the left toe kind of lost pressure. This is because of the way that the climber placed the foot immediately onto the hold and has adjusted by smearing the foot into the hole to secure the foot placement. We can see how the left toe placement helped the climber to gain direction when performing the reach. As we can see the climber is placing the toe and pushes it over to the left direction and down so that she was able to send the right hand over to the jug. Right now the climber is repositioning the right hand to gain more height by placing the hand above the hold. In doing so the climber first brought the right knee to come inwards to bring the right side of the body towards the wall to help the reach. At this moment the climber is sustaining to positive grips this one because the climber is able to wrap the fingers around the lip of the hold And now it's glancing down to perform a foot switch where she's bringing the left toe to come into place where the right toe is however, the way and technique that the climber is Performing the foot switch is called the jumping off and jumping on So the climber jumps the toe off the lip of the hold before Bringing into place the left toe and then the left toe comes to jump over the hold to apply pressure immediately This is one that is most commonly done across climbers, but also Mostly done by newer climbers who are introduced to the sport. This is because the foot switch does work This method but it's not the most accurate placement especially if done on the small holds. In this case, this is a large lip on the hold so it's hard to miss And they can take a fair bit of energy when doing this method The climber in keeping the right leg extended with the toe tapped against the wall forces the climber to have a twist of the body over to the left side which helps the climber when making the reach. The climber had just made the right foot placement and on almost performing the next move, her right toe has popped out from place. It's important that the climber always apply sufficient pressure onto the toe placement before performing the move, but due to this slip, the climber is now engaging on the arms to do a quick pull-up to pick up her weight and engaging onto the core to recover the move, as she is glancing down again at the feet to reposition a new foot placement. As we can see the climber was able to release the right foot from its foot placement, having the leg extended. This is called flagging out, so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place, and was able to transfer the left hand over to the next hold at reach. This one being a small jug with a lip where the climber can place the fingertips behind the lip of the hold. Because the climber is sending the right hand to the holder at reach, she needed to adjust due to the first placement of the hand not being the most accurate one. So the climber engages into another pull up to release some pressure at the grip to reposition the right hand grip. The climber sends the right toe to come back onto the wall to have the leg extended. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer the weight to the left foot being in place. And dropping the foot helps the climber to drop the weight onto the grips once the climber brings the hands over to a match at the last hold. The climber must sustain the match with control and stability over her body position as well as when performing the match in order to complete the climb. The climber glances down at the feet and performs a jump off jump on placement of foot switch technique. This one seemed to work even though it was placed on a small foothold. And the climber, in order to gain accuracy over the placement, the climber is glancing down at the feet. So for a split second, the climber's feet are not in contact with the hold during the process. And this can take a fair bit of energy when being performed in a small hold. However, the climber was able to secure and take the risk of this foot placement because she's hanging on to solid grips. The climber was able to take advantage of the momentum when the climber was bringing the center of gravity over to the right foot and releasing the right hand to immediately make the placement of the fingers going into the hold. Now the climber once gets to curl the fingers and applying pressure to the lip of the hold then the climber will be able to gain a stability on the move. The climber was able to send the right hand over to the next hold at reach. She first had extended the arms over the grips that she was sustaining down below to lower her center of gravity, then to quickly use momentum to pull herself on a forceful pull-up to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place and pulled down in order to gain height for the reach. The climber continues to apply pressure at the feet when transferring over the left hand over too much at the jug. And it's important that the climber eventually brings her center of gravity over to the right foot, newly into place as the climber is continuing the direction of the route to the right. The climbers are starting at a one-hold start where she places both of the hands on top of the lip of the hold. This is called matching and has placed the right toe to come into place over a hold to extend the left leg as the left toe is not placed onto the wall and is to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. Now the climber keeping the arms extended is to transfer over the weight to the grips and not standing onto the mat anymore than the climb has started. Once the climber has secured the right hand grip on a more sustainable area for the grip, this one being above the hold and not to the side, this one because the climber would have to press on the direction opposite from the opening of the hold which would have had the climber engage more force onto the arm by pointing the elbow out. But it was good of the climber to bring the hand farther up to secure the grip as the climber is able to extend the arm. This will allow the climber to gain recovery time on the arm muscles since it is not engaged and the climber is only engaging on the grip. Once the climber was able to secure the grip, we can see how she was able to transfer over the weight and releases the right foot from its place to transfer over the weight to the three areas of contact. The climber now glances down at the feet because she is making a new foot placement. It's important that the climber knows exactly in what area of the hold she will be pressing the toe onto. Eventually the left toe will help the climber to be pushed over that direction at reach. The climber was able to bring the right toe at a high foot placement. This is a large hold with a lip that is sustainable for her toe placement. Once the climber was able to apply the toe over the lip, she now presses it down and was able to transfer over the right hand over to the next hold. She is gaining height while sustaining on the grips, reason why the climber has released the left foot from its place to transfer over the weight to the highest foot. As the climber releases the left toe from its further placement, the climber is right now balancing over her areas of support as she releases the right hand to bring it over to the last hold. As soon as the climber was able to recover, had placed the left toe onto the foot chip and quickly has engaged into a quick standing up by pushing onto the left toe to gain height to bring her left hand over to the hold at reach. As we can see the right leg being extended, this is called flagging out and the climber had tapped the toe against the wall so that she can stay in position on bringing her hips close to the wall when performing the reach. It's important the climber always glances down at the feet to reposition the feet or when making a foot switch to make sure that the position of the toe coming to place at the foot chip is accurate. As the climber will need to rely on the foot placements for the stance when performing the next move.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The arms are pretty symmetrical, feet are, you know, this back foot's helping to push her into the front, the side, the other foot. And she's being very sharp. The thing I would say is in the choice to be sharp, let's also be sharp with the arms. What's sort of happening is that the arms, rather than stopping in this moment, in that sharp moment, you can see, because they're sort of fuzzy here still, you can see that she's not fully stopping her arms. She's allowing them to sort of bounce back, and so that takes away from the sharp crispness that she's attempting to achieve here. Here the dancer is attempting this mincing step again. She has got her feet a little bit closer together here so that she can get that nice shape through the hips that she's looking for. However, I would say that if she could bring this foot onto the ball of her foot, she'll have a smaller pivot point to achieve that even better. In this moment, it appears that the dancer is preparing for the next moment. One way that she could prepare in a more optimal way would be to keep her weight more on this left leg so that the right leg is more available to be leapt onto. But also if the weight is more on this left leg, she could bend it and use it more as a spring so that the next moment is even more exciting and flat. This is an excellent moment here. The dancer really appears to be quite intentional with every single part of her body. So we can see that here her hip has been thrust a little forward but mostly to the side because her left leg is parallel. And when that hip goes towards a parallel leg, it's a very interesting moment for the audience. Even though her hip has been thrust forward, she's not allowing her torso to go forward either. So what we get is this really interesting diagonal line that's very jazzy, very modern dance-y. Also, this back leg is excellent. It's helping the, she's using the ball of her foot to help make this line that she's made here from the feet up towards the head. Her head posture looks excellent. She's looking straight out at her audience. She's not thrusting her chin forward, which is a great head posture. These arms are pretty symmetrical for what she's doing here. Also, they're, in terms of their distance from her center. But also, the lines that she's making with these arms are excellent. They're interesting. They're symmetrical. So we can see that from the shoulder up to the wrist. On both sides, we've got a straight line. And then we've got this sort of little, cute little flick of the wrist at the top. And she does this movement twice and does it pretty much the same way both times, which is excellent, great technique. The way the dancer has collapsed out of this previous shape is not optimal. So she made this great, excellent shape, and then she sort of dropped out of it in a very pedestrian way. I actually thought it was the end of the piece, because of the way that she's kind of dropped out of it here. She really has just sort of let it go. It looks very pedestrian, meaning it looks just like a regular person walking around off the street. And so this is another moment where I would encourage the dancer to think about those transitions and those preparation moments. How do we continue dancing, quote-unquote dancing, through all of that? Not just in the big moment, but in between. How do we really finesse that and make it interesting and artistic, and use our technique in between the big moments, because the small moments are just as important. Here the dancer's done a great line. In this moment, she is starting to come down out of the line, but this is a great shape here and this line here. Excellent. I can see the energy coming out of the fingertips. I can see that she's using this leg to help push this hip forward. It makes a super interesting, nice, jazzy line. So here the dancer has done a step touch. So a step with the right foot and a touch with the left. What I would say could be improved about this is that this step does not match the step she just did. The step she just did was step touch step and now she's just doing step touch. So we really want to make sure that again we're being intentional and deliberate about our movements. If we're trying to do something that is the same on both sides, it's important that it's the same on both sides. So my suggestion would be clarify with the choreographer is it step touch step or just step touch. This sequence, one, two, three, four, this is count four of that sequence, almost appears... it's hard for me to tell exactly what the dancer is trying to accomplish there. It's unclear whether she's trying to just do a few steps backwards or whether she's trying to do a step-touch-step-touch. She has just come out of a large leg movement and so it may be that rather than using her core to control that leg movement coming down, she's had to recover by stepping backwards a few steps. So one way this could be improved is using core strength, using the strength of the quads and hamstring muscles to bring that leg down in a very deliberate way so that she doesn't have to recover by walking backwards a few steps. So once again here the dancer has chosen to change her facing. So at the beginning she was facing this way, which she's setting up for the audience or for the viewer that this is her down stage. And then she made an excellent 90 degree turn, and then she made this sort of angle that didn't quite make sense. And now I'm thinking that has set her up for this moment where now she's facing this way, which you know if we go back to this 90 degree angle that she set up initially, we see that this facing is not really in line with either of those facings. And so again it appears potentially that she's not aware that she's done that, so it doesn't appear deliberate. Great control on her landing here. So as she's bringing this left leg back down to the floor, she's really controlling it using her muscles so that it's not slamming down onto the floor and just hitting really nicely. That's excellent technique there. We can see in this moment she is achieving something that I believe she was attempting to achieve earlier. So basically what we can see here is she's doing this mincing step, rotating her hips to make her skirt move in this very nice way. And she's able to achieve that in this case because her feet are closer together. So when we're doing any type of mincing step like this it's always better to keep the feet closer together. In fact, any time that we want to move faster, always better to keep the feet maybe not directly next to each other but closer to our center, smaller. So in this case because her feet are closer together and because she's a little bit on the balls of her feet here, she's able to achieve a rotation with the hips and she's able to move quickly in space. One thing I would say is if she could go up on the balls of her feet even more, that would help to create a smaller pivot point on her feet so that she can get even more of that swing through her hips. Here the dancer has attempted to maintain the same rhythmic structure as the two previous phrases, however she has not achieved that. It appears as if her goal was to do the movements in a 1, 2, 3, a 4, however it seems as if maybe she's accidentally taken an extra step or didn't put that extra step, meant to do the extra step but put the extra step in the wrong place. So instead of 1, 2, 3, a 4, we're getting a little bit of a delay, so it's more like 1, 2, 3, a 4, and that kind of loses that rhythmic integrity of that particular section. This is an example of the dancer not having very great control of her arms. Right now she's made a relatively large movement. You can see here that she's made a large movement with her legs. There's a lot of momentum in that movement and rather than using her arms to help her achieve that movement in a way that looks deliberate, looks intentional, and looks like excellent technique, she's sort of allowed this arm to fly in the air. And you know again sometimes that can be what the choreographer asks for. In this case it doesn't look intentional and I'm saying that because I'm seeing the arm fly in the air without any obvious coordination between the arms and the legs. Also because once again we are not seeing great extension through this arm. So I'm drawing a line to sort of mimic her arm and we're seeing that the line isn't really a line, it's more of a curve. We can see that the elbow is not fully straight. We can see that once again the fingertips are sort of curled and I'm sort of drawing what the fingertips look like. They're curled there rather than the energy coming out, out, out, out. Anytime our arms are moving out or legs are moving out, we want to try to have the energy coming all the way out through the top. So potentially more optimal way of doing this arm movement would have been straight up with the fingers also straight. Or if this is the line that she wants to follow here from the shoulder for the arm to come out more in this direction rather than allowing these joints here to be more relaxed. So if she can bring the energy all the way out through her fingertips and really let it fly either that way, oops, well that's weird, either this way or this way that adds to this line from the heel of the right leg through the fingers of the left hand. She does a great job with her musicality here. She does a little twisting step, one, two, and it's very interesting with the music. The music's going, ba-ba-da-da, and she's going, ba-ba-step-step, right with the music, and that's great musicality there. Here she's done a good job of extending her energy all the way out through her fingertips. She's got excellent posture here. It looks like a, you know, really great curve of the spine. I really like that she's looking directly out at her fingers, and I can see that because the camera is looking out at her fingers here. Also, nice straight line from the shoulder all the way out to the fingers. She's done, she's really using her strong muscles here. She's really putting that energy all the way out through the fingertips. One thing I would say here to improve may be to force this arch a little bit. Right now, the ball of the foot is kind of towards the floor. I would say if she could bring the ball of the foot up, force onto the balls of the feet more, that would just add that little bit of icing on the cake and make this moment even that much stronger. In this section, the dancer's arms change from the beginning of this step as she moves through it. So right now what we can see is that she seems to be pointing a finger down here. However, the arms are asymmetrical. I can't tell whether she's trying to have a straight elbow or a bent elbow. So, here's another example of asymmetrical arm movements. It does appear as if she's now focused on what she's doing with her arms, but the arms, the lines are broken and they are not symmetrical with each other. This moment she's achieving even in a more optimal way this large step than that she's trying to attempt than the previous one because she's leapt on to the right foot. Her arms are really helping her and that's really giving it that nice energy she's looking for. This is another example of keeping the rhythm of her movements interesting and that engages the audience, kind of surprising the audience. So what she's done to set her up for success there is once again she's done a step that goes one, two, three, so the audience is expecting she'll continue doing something even like that. So the next one would be four, so it might sound like one, two, three, four, but that's not what she did. Instead she did one, two, three, a four. And that makes, again, it helps the audience stay more engaged because it's a little bit surprising, it's unexpected, and that's always musically interesting and aesthetically interesting. Here the dancer has again flung her arms out in a way that's quite strong. She's making a pretty good line here from this fingertip to that one. She is using her muscles in her arms to make that line really nice and strong. I would just say again, let's not bend at the wrists here. If we can keep that line even stronger just by keeping those wrists a little bit straighter. Also, in the previous moment, she was looking out at her hand. It appears that's what she would like to be doing here, but I can see that her gaze is not directly at her hand. I can partly see that because her hand in this moment is really far down in the frame. This moment and this line would be even stronger if her gaze was directly down at these fingertips. This section is quite clear what she's attempting to do and that makes it an excellent execution. So she's doing a step, touch, step, touch, step, cross, step, cross. She does it in the correct timing, meaning in the timing with the music and the tempo with the music, and she's it's very clear that she understands what she's doing so it looks quite deliberate. Again, here we see that the dancer's arms are not symmetrically moving. And also, I noticed that here at the wrists, she is breaking her line. It's always best to try and have a line that goes straight from whichever joint out to the next joint. So for example, in this case here, she has a great line here from her shoulder to her elbow. However, from her elbow to her wrist, you can see that the line breaks right there and goes out and up. That gives the impression of shortening rather than lengthening the line. The same thing is happening with this arm. So a pretty good line from the shoulder through the elbow joint, but then you see that here at the wrist, it's breaking. And that can be okay if that's deliberate. In this case, it does not look deliberate. If it were deliberate, I would expect to see the line of the wrist coming out more at a 90 degree angle. Her wrist is coming out at a wider angle than 90 degrees. Here, the dancer does a great job of making a very deliberate movement into the direction that she would like to go next. Here we can see she's doing three or four steps here with her feet and we can see how far away her feet are from each other. When the feet are that far away it's quite hard to control not only the feet but the rest of the body, especially when doing a small mincing step like the one that she's attempting to do here. So one way that she could improve this step would be to keep those feet a little closer to each other, a little closer to her center. That can help it to have a more interesting shape but also when the feet are closer to each other sometimes that can allow the hips to move in a really lovely way, especially with a flowing skirt like this and it does appear that that's the type of step she's attempting to do. So to improve that I would say let's bring those feet closer to each other, closer to her center. Another thing that could improve this step, you can see here that this foot is either fully flat on the floor or almost flat on the floor. This one that she appears to be about to step on to, yes the heel is a little bit off the floor but to make this step a little bit more crisp, a little bit more, appear a bit more intentional, also to give it that nice sway to the hips and to the skirt that she's wearing, she could go up higher onto the balls of her feet. So again two ways that this step could be improved is if she were up higher on both balls of her feet, keeping her feet closer together, closer to each other and closer to her center. That would make it look quite crisp and it would give it this sort of swaying look that she appears to be attempting to achieve. Another example of the dancer doing something in good timing with the music and what makes this little movement that she's done here interesting is that she is stepped on just prior to this so what set her up for success here sorry here with this movement is that she did a step touch step touch and now she's coming into a different rhythm so the steps touch was five was you know in a one two three four but this movement that she's doing here is in more of an eighth note count so it would it makes the step interesting musically because she's changing the tempo on us so what set us up for that to be interesting is that all these not all the previous moves the previous eight counts or so were very even one two three four five six seven eight but here she's gone one two three and four which makes the which engages the audience in a way because it's unexpected and surprising and also again appears very deliberate which is always something that we strive for when we're performing In this moment, I would say for her, it would be supportive of her technique if she would choose in the moment whether this is meant to be a full kick or whether it's meant to be more of a passe into the knee. This appears to be something in between the two. It's a little bit unclear what she's attempting here. I know that this style she's doing, there's not a whole lot of flexing or pointing. It's a little bit more of a relaxed ankle and that's okay. That's a certainly a technique choice that appears that she's made. In this moment though, I would say if that's what she's chosen to keep it more of a relaxed leg, let's keep it, ankle, let's keep it nice and relaxed all the way through the toes. Right here we can see that the ankle is a tiny bit flexed. It's in that more relaxed position but the toes are flexed upward. So you know if her choice is to be a little more loose through the ankle and foot, let's keep it that way you know every time rather than kind of coming up through the toes there. And then we see here that she has made a change from facing this pole to now facing this way. And that doesn't quite square up with the way that she turned earlier. So before she set up this, she set up the concept that this was sort of what we call her downstage, because that was the way she began facing in the piece. And then she made an excellent sort of, so here's that downstage again, and she made an excellent 90 degree turn to face this way, which is where she is coming from in the middle of this movement. But we can see that her new facing is neither facing this way or this way. She's now, instead of kind of maintaining these 90 degree angles that she herself set up as a dancer, she's now kind of in more of this sort of an angle. So it makes it quite unclear whether she's deliberately doing that or whether she's not aware that she's not in that 90 degree facing anymore. So again, in this case, it looks as if she's making moves that are movements, whether they're small movements or large movements, in this case, a large movement to change her facing, it's unclear whether she's deliberately doing that or is just not aware that she's not moving in a very accurate, to a very accurate position. This is a great choice here. This arm movement coming up and around looks excellent. It's a nice, pretty great extended line. A little bit bent through the elbow, but other than that, you know, pretty good energy coming up and around through here. It may be supportive. She's kind of looking down at the floor again here. It might be more of an interesting position and also better for her posture if she's looking straight out in that moment. Otherwise, it's an interesting choice. I like that the hips are kind of popping this way. She's got her kind of left foot coming in for a little turned in moment. This hand on the hip looks great. Here she's still going through this mincing step but we can see that now her feet are a little bit further apart from each other so she's starting to lose that nice technique of having the feet close together. However she is doing a pretty darn good job here of keeping on the balls of her feet so her pivot point is smaller. Here the dancer is attempting a mincing step again. Once again, you know feet are too far away from each other, they're too far from each other front and back, but also side to side. And I would also say, you know, once again let's be on the balls of our feet and that will really help to keep that hip movement that she's looking for. Same thing here, the dancer has come to this position that, you know, could be a very strong moment, but she's allowing it to be a little bit weaker by not engaging through the fingertips and letting the energy go out through the fingertips. Even though she's got a bent elbow here, she could still throw that energy out through those fingertips using really strong muscles here to make this position very strong. Another thing here, Here the dancer has a slightly improved line in the arm, and I'm going to show that in a different frame here, in a better frame here. This kick here again appears to be an afterthought, potentially forgot what she was doing or something. It just appears unintentional. And it appears unintentional because the kick she just did was very different from this kick, but almost appears as if this kick was supposed to look like the other one. So I would just say, you know, always being really intentional. What's the choreography? What am I trying to accomplish? And trying to really keep things symmetrical if they're meant to be symmetrical. Here it appears that the dancer was attempting to put both hands on her left hip. She has successfully kept her left hand on her hip here, and her, however, her right hand appears to be slipping this way as she continues moving. So this is another example where it seems as if the dancer is focused very much on the choreography of the feet, and sort of forgetting to keep the arms nice and crisp and tight. I think a way that this could be improved is really putting more energy into the arms, so that the muscles are engaged, rather than allowing them to slip away. So engaging these muscles here nice and tightly, right up against that hip, especially if the right hand could be directly over the left hand. So if the right hand was right over that left hand here, and keeping it nice and solid and tight against the hip, that would allow both the audience and herself to focus more on the fancy footwork that she's doing down here. She has just in this moment come back from the back of a shuffle here. Shuffle is traditionally a tap step, but swing dancers have adopted it. In this case, she did an excellent job here of keeping her ankle loose on this particular shuffle. When we have a loose ankle, we can always move faster through space, and she was able to achieve that here. So here the dancer has too abruptly let go of the final shape that she made. I would encourage her when she finishes that beautiful final shape to really hold it, allow it to sink into her body, allow it to sink into the audience. Even though there's no audience here in this room, it's great practice. Dance is a performance art. Imagining that the audience is right there in front of you and just allowing the audience to appreciate this great achievement that you just had. And really that shape especially. Let's hold that shape and show how beautiful it is. One thing that the dancer does quite well in this moment is that just prior to this, she did not maintain the rhythmic structure that she was attempting. So she basically made a mistake in terms of her rhythm. Right here, she recovers really well from that. One of the skills that a good dancer has is, you know, it's inevitable that sometimes we're going to make mistakes, and it's really good skill to be able to correct those as quickly as possible so that we can stay on the right beat and continue doing the correct moves as much as possible. So right here, she's used these two steps. So it's a step here, and then a step here, right, and then left. She's used those two steps to get herself back on the correct tempo. Here the dancer has attempted to make another line in this direction, like let me do a better stroke there, in this direction like she did before. But it's very hard to capture that moment because she did not hold that line for very long. So now it's already a collapsing sort of line here. So important to really have those strong, strong muscles, keep those lines nice and straight. This is in the middle of a sequence of steps, one, two, three, four or so, sort of like that, that appear to be preparing her for this next big movement, for a big movement that she might do next. However, when, to make this, I would say to make this more of an optimal movement, the steps themselves would be part of the dance, rather than just a preparation for something else. Meaning, the steps need to also be interesting to look at, need to be really well thought out. The arms need to be very deliberate, so that we're not, what happens, what's happening here is that she's stepping to prepare for something, rather than stepping to dance. And when we're just stepping to prepare for something, it's more like an acrobatic or a gymnastic sort of performance. With dance, every single step needs to have full energy in it. So that's what I would recommend with these steps is, you know, inviting her to think about, how can I make these steps part of the dance, rather than a preparation for something? How can I make them interesting for myself and for the audience? A couple of ways that she could do that, again, not breaking these lines, being really deliberate and intentional in thinking about, being proactive about what the arms are doing. Something more, a little bit more interesting than just walking with the steps, she could try going back into that sort of mincing step with, on the balls of the feet, with the feet close to each other, as she's moving forward into what she's about to do. So again, to make this more of an optimal moment, so that it engages the audience and keeps it interesting for us, and it keeps it interesting for her, to be honest, is having her think about, how can I use my whole entire body? How can I add a little bit of flair, a little bit of pizzazz to this movement, so that it's not just preparing me for something else? So that itself is interesting, as well as the big thing that I might be about to do. Here's a nice moment where the dancer is again finding this interesting line through the hip, pushing through the back ball of the foot to bring this hip thrust to the side and forward. She's also bringing her arms up into a nice line. And another thing that's really supportive of this moment is her head position here. So she's actually looking up towards the ceiling as she's bringing her arms up and that gives it a really nice sort of regal feel, very intentional looking, very deliberate looking, got a nice regal vibe to it and it helps this head position is helping to support the line of the arms as they come up. Here the dancer is doing a repetitive motion bringing the arms in and then out again. This appears sort of like a weak position and I would suggest that to make it appear stronger to really engage these muscles in the upper arm and really let the energy go all the way out the fingertips. I can tell that the energy is not going out the fingertips in this frame here. These fingers are sort of curled in. Maybe the energy is starting to come out here a little bit but what we really want to see is the energy going all the way out through the fingertips past the fingertips. Here we're seeing a forward head posture rather than straight up and down. It's an interesting choice to be looking over the shoulder. I would just say let's keep that head nice and in line with the torso. Here, the dancer is kind of coming towards the end of her piece and this moment from the sound of the music and from the motion itself appears to be a moment that's meant to be very big and exciting. What's happened, however, is that she's cut off that energy by stepping onto this foot rather than leaping onto it. So a step is just what you might imagine, stepping from one foot to the other. A leap is actually sort of jumping from one foot to the other. Instead of leaping, she's stepped onto it, which has prevented her from making this really nice big motion that I think she's attempting to do. Another thing is that that motion could appear even bigger and more energetic if the arms come from here and go around. She's sort of initiated them from here. So here the dancer has brought her arm up like this and now she's bringing it down here. Unfortunately, she cuts off the line right there. So it appears to me like she's about to do a beautiful big arc with her arm, but for some reason she's cutting it off there. So I would encourage her to kind of talk with her choreographer and see, well, what was the point of me bringing my arm up and down like that? Do we even need to do that? Is there a way that she could spend a little bit more time bringing that arm up and around to kind of finish that line? So now the dancer has moved into a motion of bringing the arms out into a line and then back in for a clap. It's unclear to me when this particular sequence was supposed to start, meaning just prior to this she was doing just the arms straight out and then down and straight out and down, and now she's going straight out, clap, straight out, clap. But it appears that maybe she forgot that she was supposed to be doing these claps because out of these four moments only two or three of them have the clap in them. So just being really clear about what you're doing, being intentional about what you're doing, being deliberate about what you're doing is always super helpful in dance. Here the dancer is moving her arms as she moves her legs. One thing I'm noticing about her technique is that when she's lifting this arm or this arm, we can also see that she's kind of lifting the elbow. So that suggests to me that the, sorry, I meant to say lifting the shoulder. So this suggests to me that the movement of the arms is coming from the shoulder. In any Western dance technique, typically we want the arm movements to actually come from the latissimus dorsi, from the back or from the scapula in the back. You can't really see that on this dancer here. Rather than using these sort of deltoids or the trapezius muscle in the neck and shoulder here to lift the arms, we always think, we always say, you know, we want to lift the arms from below rather than from above. And so I can tell that this dancer needs a little bit of support around maybe even strengthening her back muscles so that she can feel more how to use those back muscles. Or just getting coached, like, hey, let's keep the shoulders down. Typically when the arms are going up in any sort of direction, we want to keep the shoulders down rather than up. And so again, she can achieve that by using more of her latissimus dorsi, her rhomboids and scapula in the back and her, and letting this trapezius relax a little bit. Lifting from below rather than from above. One other thing about this section is, again, I can see that her sternum is here and her chin is here. So she's got a forward head posture that could be improved by bringing the chin back a little bit, keeping the gaze level with her head rather than down towards the floor. And also even visualizing a string coming directly from the top of her head to help elongate her cervical spine. Here the dancer is moving into another line and she's set up for us this expectation that when the arms are going out there it's going to happen it just in one count because that's what she's just done. In this case she's opening those arms up in two counts so that could be really an interesting choreographic choice because as an audience member I'm expecting to see a one two one two but I'm seeing a one two moment and that's that's that would be interesting I don't think she quite achieves that here so I would say just being a little bit more deliberate about exactly when those hands are gonna and those arms are gonna hit that last shape So here is another example of the head forward posture that is not optimal. We can see, you know, here is sort of the front of her sternum and here's her nose. So we can see that her nose is quite a bit further forward than her sternum. That head forward posture is suboptimal. There's a couple of ways that this could be corrected. Right now it appears that her gaze is more towards the floor rather than straight in front of her. That's one way that we can improve a head forward posture. Another way that she could improve a head forward posture is to imagine a string coming directly, let me do that a little bit better, a string coming directly up from the center of her head. That will often allow for a sort of floating feeling of the head which can elongate the cervical spine here and allow for a more upward posture with the head. Here's another example of asymmetrical arm movements that do not appear super intentional. This arm here, sorry let me do that a little bit more clearly, this arm here, she's breaking her line. So this twist that she's doing here in her upper torso is not in line with where this arm is going from her shoulder. So it's almost as if her shoulder has not come around with her on that that twist. So one thing I would recommend is that if she's going, if she would like to have this broken line from the shoulder, either make the elbow more 90 degrees or more straight and that would give it a bit more interest and prevent the line from appearing broken. Another option would be to bring the shoulder more around with her on the torso which would also bring the arm more around with her. So here is towards the climax of the piece. This leg is looking pretty good. It's, you know, a little bit more than 90 degrees. It does appear that she may be hyperextending her knee. It's a little bit hard to tell, but I'm wondering that because I see this line sort of breaking here at the calf. So I think she may be hyperextending her knee. It's not great for her health long-term and also does break the line that we're trying to make. So I would just investigate, you know, am I hyperextending my knee? If so, I might need to bend it a little bit more than I think I need to. And I would also make sure that she's not pronating through this foot. It appears she may be slightly pronated, meaning collapsing in on her arches, in order to get that leg nice and high. So I think she might need a little bit more work in flexibility in her adductor muscles and her hamstrings so that she doesn't feel as if she needs to pronate through here or hyperextend her leg in order to get it nice and high. However, I will say that her flexed foot here is looking really great. She's putting a lot of energy into keeping it nice and flexed rather than kind of floppy. So even though it's not in a straight line from her hip, it is in a sort of a 90-degree angle, which looks very intentional, looks very interesting. However, I would suggest that she think about, again, what's happening with this arm. This nice, strong leg at the climax of the piece should be mirrored by a nice, strong arm here. So we should see more of a line like that rather than a nice, straight line here and then a curve coming up. So this is another moment where I would say, let's make sure, is the line coming out that way? Is it coming up this way? Whichever one it is, let's try to keep that a nice, straight line from the shoulder all the way out through the fingertips. So here's another example of the dancer not moving her arms in a symmetrical way. I can tell that what she was attempting to do here was to bend her elbows and snap her fingers of both hands at the same time. And that's great. She did accomplish snapping her fingers at the same time as each other, but also on the beat. That's excellent. The part that I could say could be improved is that the arms are not symmetrical. So you can see here this right elbow is kind of more directly against her body, and then the forearm is coming kind of 90 degrees away from her body. However, on the other side, the elbow has more distance. A little bit hard to see here, but when I clear that, you can see there's more distance between her torso and her elbow. Also, this angle of the elbow up is much of a shallower angle, and that can be okay as long as it looks deliberate. In this case, it doesn't look deliberate. It looks as if the dancer is not aware that her arms are moving in an asymmetrical way. This left leg hitting the ground was just a teensy little fraction of a millisecond too early for the music. So she set up this nice rhythmic moment where she was right on the beat and then she lost it in this second. So just encouraging her to take her time. That foot could have come down just a second later. Maybe it's a matter of core strength or strength through the leg muscles to really control that movement down or it could just be a musicality issue. So on this really big movement that's towards the climax of the piece, this leg has come up really nicely. The arms also really need to be super controlled and deliberate, especially because, again, this is sort of the climax of the piece. We really want to make sure we're seeing that really nice, strong moment that we're sort of missing because the arms are a little bit weak there. So here the dancer is finishing a mincing step, but in this moment what she's done is really turned in her hip and I can tell that because the toes are now facing this way even though the rest of her body is facing this way. It's unclear you know why she ended up turning in that hip there, so it's really important let's just be super intentional. Is this a turned in hip or is this a parallel hip or is this a turned out hip? Here the dancer appears she's attempted to do something called a shuffle. She's, this movement here with her foot is the second part of the shuffle. A shuffle typically includes just this part of the foot, the ball of the foot basically. And typically includes a front and back motion, especially in swing dance, not so much in tap and tap. It's more of an up-down motion, but she's, it appears she's trying to do the technique of the front-back type of shuffle. What is holding her up here, this particular shuffle I think is the reason that she's having a difficulty staying on the rhythm, rhythmic structure that she's setting up. So she's set up one, two, three, a four, one, two, three, a four in the two previous phrases. And it appears she attempted to do that in this phrase. And I think that this shuffle she's doing here is maybe what's holding her up. And I'm saying that because a shuffle is the most, shuffles are most successful when the ankle is loose. And in her case, her ankle is not loose enough to make the shuffle quick enough to make this particular section line up with the rhythmic structure that she is attempting to achieve. So one thing that she can improve here is keeping her ankle nice and loose so that when she does that forward-back motion to try to make this shuffle happen, she doesn't have to use so much energy here in her upper leg or her lower leg here. She can really just barely move them and her ankle, when it's loose, will follow along and she will get those two shuffle sounds that she's looking for without having to put in so much energy. And when you don't have to put in, and if she didn't have to put in so much energy, she could achieve that shuffle a little bit more quickly and could have stayed within that rhythmic structure that she's attempting here. Here's a moment where I would really like to encourage symmetry through the arms and intentionality through the arms. The arms have come up most likely simply because the leg has come up. They're in reaction to what's happening down here. Instead of being proactive and being part of the piece, they're sort of reacting and flopping as the energy is moving through the legs. And I can tell that because this elbow is in this shape, this one is in this shape. I can see that the shoulders are a little bit raised where we want to keep our shoulders down every time we're moving our arms. We see this wrist is sort of, what would I say, pronated and the other one is more directly up and down and so they're not symmetrical. It's okay to use your arms in a utilitarian way as long as you're intentionally doing that. I don't think that this dancer is intentionally doing that. Here the dancer has done a step touch. So this right foot has done a step and this left foot is doing a touch. The dancer's energy on the touch was down. So when she brought that left foot to her touch, her whole body also went down. With a touch it's very helpful to keep the body weight even, not to go up or down, but if anything to err on the side of going up away from the floor rather than down towards the floor. And also with the touch, a touch never should have weight on it. So a touch is called a touch because it's just for a second touching that floor and then moving back away from the floor. So I would encourage this dancer to really keep her weight all the way on that standing leg, in this case her right leg, and just do a very gentle touch with that back foot, keeping her weight forward and her energy either even or if anything a tiny bit upwards when she does the movement. Here the arms appear to be an afterthought, appear to be unintentional. So, you know, again, we always want to be very deliberate and intentional with our steps when we're dancing because that just shows excellent technique and it keeps it very interesting for the audience because it's very crisp. In this case, the arm has swung around to this side in a way that does not appear intentional. Here's another good example of the dancer using great technique. What she's done here is her right hip is thrust towards her right leg, which has a parallel, or her hip is in parallel. And that's a very jazzy, modern dance sort of fun line that she's making there. What set her up for success in this moment is that just before this, she was doing the opposite feet. So she had her weight on her left leg, and her left hip was thrust forward. That helps to create momentum for her to move back in this way. Another thing that's great about this moment is she's using this leg to help push her and thrust her in that direction. That's helping her to make this great line. Head posture looks great. Her chin does not appear to be thrust forward. She does not appear to be looking down at the floor. Also, her arms are pretty symmetrical, and it's really nice she's making this straight line. That's interesting because up until this point, so I guess what I should say is setting her up for success in this moment is that prior to this, her arms have mostly been doing this or something like that. And so this is different. This is straight across pretty much, which makes it interesting because it's unexpected. Also, they're quite symmetrical. They're pretty straight. She is a little bit hyperextending this elbow, which is forcing these fingers to go a little bit more behind her than is optimal. So one thing I would suggest is trying not to hyperextend that elbow there. But other than that, the arms are quite symmetrical. We see pretty much a straight line from the shoulder to the elbow and from the elbow to the wrist. And then what's really especially excellent about this is that her fingers are also straight. And the reason that they're straight is because she's allowing her energy to come from her center all the way out to those fingertips, all the way out to those fingertips. We always want to try to keep that energy flowing out, and she's done an excellent job of that here. I love that in this moment she's looking pretty much directly up at her hand. That helps to accentuate this line that she's making with her arms. I see her fingers are quite extended so her energy is moving out through that arm. We can't see this arm quite as well but it does appear that she's really allowing her energy to go nice and strongly out of that arm too. Appears that she's really pushing through the ball of the foot to help push through this hip and make that line that she's trying to achieve. The dancer begins to dance as soon as the music starts, which makes it difficult for her to find the tempo of the music. One way she can improve this is by waiting four or eight counts before starting so that she can get a good idea of the rhythm and tempo of the music. Here the dancer has kept the same rhythm to her steps as she had in the previous section, so that also sets her up for success here. Now she's established this new rhythm that we can expect to see again. So the rhythm is 1 2 3 a 4 and then she repeats that 1 2 3 a 4. This moment with her arms here, they've come, both arms have kind of come down and around, and this one's kind of down and around. So a couple of things that I would say she could improve here, one again, asymmetrical arms. So we see that this elbow is bent and this one is mostly straight. It would be, it could be improved by both arms either being bent or both elbows being bent or both elbows being straight. Another thing is that this motion of them coming down with combined with the fact that the energy of her arm is not coming all the way out through her fingers. So we can see here that her fingers are sort of bent rather than energy coming straight out all the way through her fingers. It kind of appears that potentially she may have been unaware of what her arms were doing in that moment and using them more in a utilitarian way to help her make this movement that she's making here. In performance, we always want to try and be aware of every part of our body and have an intentional deliberate movement in each of them, including the arms. Sometimes we do use them in a utilitarian way, but in this case, I don't think that that was what the choreographer meant to do. It appears that the dancer was simply just unaware as she was focusing on making this turn that she's making here. Here the dancer has shot her arm out, however she's left her hand to sort of flop. So I would say, you know, keeping that energy moving out through the fingertips. Here, the dancer is demonstrating a lack of awareness and control in the arms. There's a broken line from here to the elbow and then from the elbow to the wrist and then again from the wrist to the hand. Same thing over here. We can't tell, I can't tell exactly what her intention is in making these shapes. The arms do not appear symmetrical. One shoulder is a little higher. She is sort of doing, it appears as if she's attempting to do this sort of up-down movement with her shoulders, but it doesn't appear very intentional, perhaps because the movements are quite subtle. I think if she could exaggerate those shoulder movements a bit more, they might appear more intentional. Another thing we can see, again, these arms are not symmetrical. So this right arm, even though it appears she's trying to do this up-down shoulder movement, we can still see that this right arm and this left arm are not the same distance away from her body, which again, when it's not symmetrical like that, it just appears that as if she's not super aware of what her arms are doing and not super in control of what her arms are doing. Once again, here, the dancer has made a great, excellent, interesting line with this leg. I would encourage some strengthening, or excuse me, some stretching through the hamstrings so that the pelvis doesn't have to come forward to bring the leg up nice and high and so that this knee doesn't have to be bent. It may have been an intentional choreographic choice to keep that leg bent. So that may not be an issue. With the arms, however, though, again, let's make sure that this beautiful line that she's making here is reflected in the arm movements. Here, we're seeing a bent elbow, bent fingertips, energy's not coming all the way out through those fingertips. And the same thing on this side. It seems a little bit curved here through those fingertips. So that breaks the energy and breaks the line that she's made here with the leg. This is a really cute little pose that she's done here. So she's brought her right hand onto her hip, her left hand's kind of a little bit, you know, forward here. She's got this cute little turned in position, really kind of common Fosse jazz type of position. I would encourage her to really amp that up, amp up that pose, really demonstrate what she's doing, make it nice and crisp. Maybe hold it for a tiny bit longer. Maybe get into it with a little bit more force. So it really accentuates the pose that she's making. Once again, throughout this section, we can see that the dancer is not moving her arms in a symmetrical way. Here we can see one of the concerns I have overall for this dancer, and it's kind of from the shoulders up. What we're seeing here is more of a head forward posture. And we can see that because here's kind of the front part of her shoulder. And then here's her nose. So we can see that her head in general tends to remain a bit more forward than is optimal in terms of posture for dancing. Here the dancer is doing a motion with her arms and hands where she's bringing the elbows in and then out and when the elbows come out she's flicking the wrists down. What would make this more successful is either keeping the elbows glued against the body and then the hands coming out from there or keeping the elbows here but not moving them and just focusing on flicking the wrists at the appropriate time. In this moment it's unclear whether the dancer potentially forgot the next step. So this, not the next step, but this current step. So she just did a jump onto her, or leap onto her left leg, and her right leg is currently behind her. This particular moment appeared just slightly behind the beat. It almost seemed to catch her off guard. And so if she forgot the step, there's nothing else to do except remember the step next time to improve that. If she didn't forget the step and she was just behind the music, one way to improve that is to try to be right on that tempo, on whatever, right on that beat, on whatever beat you're supposed to be on for that movement. Again, when we're doing a choreography for a performance, it's really important that what we're doing is intentional and comes across to the audience as intentional. In this moment it seemed unintentional that she did this movement. Here again, the dancer appears to be repeating something she's just done But she's a little bit behind her timing here. So this should be on a 5-6 or a 3-4 or a 5-6 She's just a tiny bit behind her timing So again, it makes it look unintentional as if maybe she forgot what she was about to do or lost track of the timing here Another thing here is that we again want the energy to come all the way out through the fingertips in both arms at all times. Here, the dancer has made an excellent change in her facing from directly forward to directly 90 degrees from where she was facing before. She did this in a very deliberate way, which is excellent. Here the dancer has good extension through this right arm. So we can see that from the shoulder to the fingertips is almost a straight line. That's excellent. That appears intentional. It appears deliberate. And it allows for an interesting line coming from this crossed leg all the way up through the fingers. One thing that has helped her be successful here is that she's allowing her energy to go up. All the way through her fingertips. And I can tell that because this joint is lined up with this one. Is lined up with this one. And you can see here that her fingers are also extended. So once again that helps to create a line across her body. Which is interesting, appears intentional, and appears deliberate. One thing I would say again for improvement here is this head forward posture. So we can see that it appears as if she's gazing down towards the floor. That's typically a big no-no in dance. We want to be gazing out at our audience or wherever the choreographer wants us to. Which is almost never the floor. Often looking at the floor is going to then cause this chin, which you can see here, to jut forward relative to the neck and chest. Here the dancer has done something a step very similar to what she just did but her arm is very different. Here her arm has this bent nature to the elbow and the hand is doing more of what we call a jazz hand so the fingers seem to be splayed apart. I would say when we're doing the same step twice unless you really are intentionally trying to do something different try to keep the arms the same as each other each time. This is a great shape. So I think this is excellent technique, really good shape here. We've got a nice forced hip here, which is a really interesting, nice jazzy moment. The leg is slightly bent here, but not too bent. So again, it gives it that nice kind of fossy jazz shape that's really interesting and lovely. She's doing great at keeping her feet pretty parallel here towards to each other. So not too turned in at the hip or turned out. The arms have nice energy through them. They're symmetrical. The hands look really graceful. I think in this case, having the head posture a little bit forward is actually great because it lends itself to this sort of fossy shape through the leg. The only thing I would say is this beautiful shape, let's not lose it. I would encourage her to hold it there at the end. This is her big finale. So I would recommend you hold that position, hold, hold, hold for a few counts, and then let it go. And unfortunately, in the next moment, she's letting it go. Great musicality there. The music said, Bum-ba-da, and she did a step, step, step. Very good musicality. Here the dancer is doing a sort of a windmill arm. This could be improved in this left arm if the wrist were straight. Sort of how this one is doing. This right arm looks great. It's nice and straight all the way through to the fingertips. This one kind of bends and so it loses that windmill line that we're looking for here. In this moment, it appears maybe the dancer forgot what she was supposed to do or doesn't know exactly what she's supposed to be doing because she's kind of swung her arm around here, swung her leg around. It's unclear what she's attempting here. So, let's, I would just encourage her to be really sharp, crisp, and deliberate about her movement. Here the dancer has done a little touch and is bringing this leg across. This moment now makes a little bit more sense of what she's just done. So potentially setting her up for this to look successful was that her right foot was just turned in a moment ago. However, it does not appear that what she's doing there is intentional. Here the dancer's arm movements are not symmetrical and not very well coordinated with her shoulder movements. Here the dancer has brought her right leg forward. It was just behind her and that has set her up for success to make this movement interesting. Because she leapt on to that left leg and had this right leg behind her, there was a enough momentum to bring this leg forward in a way that looks quite interesting. One place for improvement again here is really being deliberate and intentional and aware of the arm movements. So it's sort of hard to tell in this freeze frame, but the arms appear to be more sort of following what the legs are doing or moving in a reactive way to what the legs are doing and are kind of floppy and there's not very much extension or strength through those arms. And actually you can see in this version of the video here that the fingers are curled in towards the palm. You know that can be an intentional choice. This does not appear intentional. It almost appears as if she's almost in a fist sort of a shape and that does break the line and it breaks the energy of the arms. And I think that what's leading to that is the fact that she's not putting a lot of awareness and intentionality into the arm movements. There's not a lot of muscle in muscle engagement through there, at least an intentional muscle engagement. So the arms are sort of flopping and reacting rather than being proactive like the legs are doing.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

As you can see, he already has dropped his follow through. You will notice with shooters who have really good follow throughs, they tend to have a tendency to get lazy and drop their follow through early. So when they're missing shots, the best way to correct it is just to tell them, hold your follow through. So it's a good way to get someone who has a good follow through to refocus themselves. So holding that follow through until the ball goes through the basket or hits the rim forces them to focus just for a little bit longer, which just that little bit of extra focus increases the shooting percentage. Or someone who doesn't have a good follow through and is looking to work on it, you have them hold their follow through in order to be able to correct the mistakes in their follow through. This shooter right here, he has a good follow through. So you can tell it's a habit of him because he knows he has a good follow through and he has a good feel for it. He's built up a habit of not holding the follow through. Now as we see as he goes into his shot, now he has turned his wrist to get his hand in the correct position from the side of the ball to underneath the ball. So in order for it to, the placement of his hand right now is where his hand should be when he catches the ball. So once he actually gets into this position here, his hand placement is right where he wanted it to be. But the problem is there's a lot of moving parts in order for him to get his hand to this position. So in order to eliminate all the excess movement and all the excess things that could go wrong with his shot, the positioning that his hand is right now is this is where we want it to be as soon as he catches the ball. as the shooter releases the ball you can see this right elbow is at his eye level so as long as we get this elbow as a right handed shooter as long as we get that right elbow to our eye level we're gonna get a really nice arc on this ball that will go into the basket so make sure that we have the proper footwork and the elbow up to the eye level and generate nice power from the ground up through our body the ball through the ball and into the basket this right here is a nice example of us shooting that shot snapping that wrist having a good follow through and having the proper footwork and proper balance and getting that elbow to our eye level to get the proper amount of arc for our shot As you can see here, the shooter has really good balance with the positioning of his feet. From this angle, you can tell that his right foot is slightly in front of his left foot, which means that his right elbow is going to be straight and aligned to the basket. This is really good. His base and his foundation from the ground up is looking good. Over here with the ball, if you take a look at his left hand, his guy hand is already kind of behind the ball as he's going up into his shot. You want to slide this guy hand down more this way, just a little bit. So it's more on the side and his fingers are not behind the ball. So as he's raising the ball up, his hand is behind the ball, so you're already kind of blocking your own shot. The direction that we want the ball to go, the fingers of your left hand are in the way. So we have to move that hand to the side of the ball more so the fingers of our left hand are out of the way. And now we see here his right hand, his index finger, is on the side of the ball. We want this index finger on our shooting hand to be more in the middle of the ball. So he has his hand here, he has his finger here. We would like to get it over into this area right here if possible. Whether his hand is on top of the ball, fingers here, I've seen that, or directly behind the ball. Whether his right hand is on top of the ball or behind the ball, when he raises the ball above his head, his hand will naturally go underneath the ball and be in the correct position. But since his hand is on the side of the ball, as he raises the ball up above his head and to his motion to shoot, he has to turn his wrist in order to get the ball into the right position. The best thing to do is already have your wrist and your fingers in the correct place on the catch. So that way when you go up into your shot, you don't have to do too much movement with your wrist as you're trying to go up into your shot. The less movement that we have in our shot, the more consistent our shot will be. The more moving parts that we have in our shot, that increases the chances that something can go wrong. So we want to eliminate as much of the extras in our shot as possible. That way we cut down the risk of something actually going wrong in our shot while we shoot that causes us to miss. As the coach pass the player the ball, you see he has his left foot in front. So he's gonna, he stepped towards the pass to catch the ball with his left foot. And he's gonna bring this right foot in front, slightly in front of his left foot to square himself up to the basket and shoot the ball. Ideally, we would like for on the catch as he's stepping into it for him to drop his hips a little bit. So he's loaded and ready to shoot. So that's our ready to shoot position where we drop our hips and we step to the ball with our left foot first as a right-handed shooter. We step to the ball first with our left foot, hands up ready to catch the ball. And then when we catch the ball, we catch the ball in a position, our hands are in a position where we're gonna shoot it. So as we raise the ball up, there's no movement with our wrists or the ball. Everything's already locked and loaded and ready to go. All I have to do once I catch the ball, just raise it up and knock the shot down. as he releases the ball you can see that guy hand is nice and open guiding the ball directly to his basket we can see the right wrist is he snapped the right wrist causing the ball to get a good rotation and good backspin so we have good backspin on the ball right here so the follow through after once he gets it to the point and releases the shot is a good follow through as you see here he raises the ball up above his head and his right hand is still on the side of the ball and his right hand is still on the side of the ball his left hand is still behind the ball", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

With the ball placed here on the backboard, she would need to create side spin on the ball for the ball to spin off of the backboard and go into the basket. On the release of the shot she was able to create the necessary side spin so once it hit this location on the backboard it spin off of the backboard and went directly into the basket. After she makes the layup and the ball goes through the basket, she allows the ball to bounce and hit the ground. This is due to her being so far away from the basket that she's unable to catch the ball as it comes through the net. When we're doing the mic and drill, we want to make sure we want to make sure that the ball never hits the ground and after every time we make the layup, we're in position to catch the ball as it comes through the net and then we can as we catch the ball, we can immediately go up on the opposite side of the basket and shoot the ball. The player here is demonstrating the Mike and Drew where you jump off of two feet. And you can see, take a look at the positioning of the ball in her arm. She does a good job of extending the ball out away from her body and having her hand underneath the ball. With her arm extended out in this fashion and the positioning of her hand underneath the ball, this allows for her to create a side spin on the ball as she shoots the ball off of the backboard. The side spin that she created with the release will be able to spin the ball off of the backboard and go into the basket. However, looking at her positioning on the floor, we can see that she is not underneath the basket. When we are doing the Mike and Drew, we want to make sure that we are positioning ourselves underneath the basket and not so far out in front of the basket. So her positioning on the floor is incorrect. And because she is so far out from the basket, it is going to be very difficult for her to perform the drill correctly. Due to the player being in the incorrect position on the floor, as she releases the shot from her hand, she hits the bottom of the rim and she misses the shot because where she released the ball from isn't the best position on the floor to shoot the layup during a mic and drill. This is why it's important for us to use the proper footwork during the mic and drill as when we use the correct footwork, it will place us in the best positions on the floor in order to make the layup as easy as possible. And while we're doing the mic and drill, we always want to put ourselves in the best position to make the layup that we're attempting as easy as possible. As she shoots the ball with her right hand on the right side of the basket, she does not take any steps, so she's not using any footwork for the Mike and Drew. When we're going to the right side of the basket, we want to take our first step with our left foot to the right side of the basket, and then we're swinging our right foot into position to square ourselves up. So we'll have our right foot here and our left foot here, and then once we're in this position here, we jump up and shoot the ball with our right hand off of the backboard and into the basket. As she is going to shoot the ball with her left hand on the left side of the basket, she steps with her outside foot, which is her left foot. When we're doing a Mike & Drew and we're going to the left side of the basket, we want to take the first step with our right foot to the left side of the basket. So her right foot should be positioned here for step one, and then she'll swing her left foot into position here for step two, and then shoot the ball with her left hand off of the backboard and into the basket.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They have a lot of nice clarity in this moment and consistency when performing this movement. As the dancer begins to perform a triple step and a rock step alternating as he's turning around himself, he's still struggling to move through the space as he's turning around himself, particularly with his footwork. However, when he's not turning around and he's staying stationary or performing the triple step and the rock step in fairly the same facing, he finds a lot of clarity in his footwork. He would benefit from bringing that clarity through the stationary movement into the movement that locomotes around himself. As the dancer begins to do a basic step touch or a side-to-side movement with their partner, they appear to be connected to the rhythm and have an understanding of the movement vocabulary. They're able to effectively use their feet primarily to stay connected to the rhythm, while using their arms to stay connected physically to their partner. As the dancer transitions through a few different steps that locomote him and his partner through the space, he again struggles to find consistency in his footwork. He's able to go in and out of being connected to the rhythm, however, he's really inconsistent in the clarity as well as the rhythmic embodiment. As the dancer performs a kind of a stylized walk moving forward in the space holding their partner with one arm, they really start to reconnect to the rhythm here. They find a lot of clarity in their footwork, they have a nice soft bounce happening in their body which is showing that they're able to embody the rhythm and overall appear strong in this moment. As the dancer turns around himself, moving his partner around the periphery, he struggles to find some clarity in his footwork, though he is able to stay fairly connected to the rhythm just by keeping up with the tempo and because the partner is helping him move along in that way.

In this moment to keep her left side close to the wall as she is releasing some of the pressure up out of her right hand grip. Now with the right hand we can see the climber placing the fingers flat on the top area of the hold. With the thumb wrapped around it helps the climber to sort of create a pinch as she's folding her hand onto the knuckles trying to bring the palm close to the hold. Now the climber what she's doing is trying to engage as much skin over the hold to create friction as she will need to create eventually pressure on her open hand grip and try to close it to sustain the grip. The climbers is starting at one hold start where she places both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching and she's sustaining to the lip of the hold where it indents in and the climber is able to curl the fingers behind the lip of the hold. This one being a jug the climber is able to add extra support into the grip by pinching it using the thumbs from underneath to squeeze the hold. Once the climber got to secure the grips she's able to lean back to transfer the weight to the grips and brought the left toe to come into place much lower than the right foot that is placed at a distance. The climber releasing the right foot, she needs to continue to apply pressure onto the left foot placement. It could be potentially that the climber did not place accurately the toe over the hold or the climber did not give it sufficient pressure onto the hold. So it's important that the climber brings the toe as far in towards the wall and places the toe above the foot chip. This one being as small, if the climber places it too much out away from the foothold because the foothold might be rounded, then she wouldn't have much surface of the foot meeting with the hold, resulting potentially for the slip. The climber releasing the right foot to bring it over to the next placement after placing the left foot. The left foot has slipped out from the hold. Now both of the feet had come in contact with the ground ending the climb. The climber is placing her hands inside of the chalk bag. This is to cover her hands with the powder that will help her gain a better grip when sustaining to the holds when at the climb as well as absorbing any moisture that may be built up at her hands. The climber had dropped the left foot this way so the climber was able to load most of her weight onto the grip and find the right position on the adjustment before bringing the left foot back into its place where she would then release pressure as she would not be loading it completely. Also, she's bringing the left foot to come into position so that she's able to release the right foot from its place as next the climber will need to transfer the left hand to the next move. The climber here engages immediately on an efficient move where she pushes down into the feet to raise the hips and that way throw her shoulder up rotating her top area of the torso to send the right hand to come into place onto the next hold it reach.

Due to not making the reach, the climber then now will be brought down due to her center of gravity being thrown off. The climber in applying the toe to apply pressure over the hold, she was struggling and create that pressure. This is because the climber is leaning over to the right side making it really hard for the climber to sustain pressure onto the left foot as most of the weight is transferred over to the right foot being in place. Right now the climber is bringing her center of gravity low to keep her feet above her hips. This is because the climber right now is glancing at the hold reach where she will need to perform a dynamic move. Once the climber was able to transfer over the weight to the right hand grip, after securing it, she is bringing now the left foot that was out and extend it to come over to a high foot placement, coming to a match where the left hand is. As we can see, the climber sends the heel into the wall and is placing the outer area of the heel towards the hold. This is called a heel hook and the climber is placing the heel hook as one of the foot techniques that helps the climber to keep her center of gravity close to the wall. This is a strong foot placement as the climber could be working on a series of moves or one big move while keeping the heel in place. The climber is glancing over to bring the right foot at a high foot placement due to the next hold being at reach to the right side. So the climber brings the right foot at a high foot placement over the flat surface of the hold. This one almost plays by the lip since it is slightly curved in and it will be more positive for the climber to apply the sole of the foot on the toe area towards the hold. The climber needs to try to place the shoe above the surface of the hold and create significant pressure onto the right foot placement in order to stick the rubber to the pores of the hold. Here we can see the climber has gain height and stand up over her feet being in place while pulling her right hand a Grip towards her by bringing the elbow close to the core in order to send the left hand over to the next hold at reach Now the weight of the climber is sustaining to the top hold. She's sending The hand over as a hook to apply the skin over the open grip this one is a Handle that is thick so the climber brings the fingers far in into the hold in order To apply pressure and secure the grip The climber was able to remove the right toe from its place down below and statically send the right toe to a high foot placement. The clamboran making a move over her mean areas of support with the left extended and Continue to do one extra move. This is called bumping and she has moved the hand to come up further Because it has a more secure grip lending the hand onto a jug The climber is glancing over at the hold at reach and even if she had placed the right foot to come into surface at the hold previously, she instead has brought over the right toe to come into place where the left toe was to release the left toe from its place. Now the left leg extended. This is called flagging out so it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. The climber is starting at a one-hold start where she places both of the hands onto the hold. This is called matching and the climber places the palms facing up towards the lip of the hold. As we can see this type of hand placement is called an undercling where the climber gets to slide the fingers behind the lip of the hold and can use the thumbs above the hold in order to secure the grip by pinching onto the hold meaning squeezing. Now in order for the climber to support the grips she will have to pull herself in or pull the hold towards her bringing the elbows close to the core to sustain the grips. Now the climber is standing on the mat and once the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing in the mat then the climb will start. The climber in order to perform a dynamic move she needed to jump over her feet and in this case the climber Lack height to place the hand over the hold This is because the climber was focusing on applying pressure onto the left foot placement Which she was struggling to apply and that distracted the climber from applying Most pressure onto the right foot placement reason why the climber wasn't able to perform the jump with sufficient height Heel hooks can be tricky to release because they provide a lot of force and in this case the climber chose to stay into one side of the hole matching the grips to transfer the weight over to the right side as a climber then engaged into a quick pull in with her heel being engaged to then release it to quickly place the toe above the hold The climber was able to send the right hand over to the next hold at reach and having the left leg extended helps a climber to keep balance over her areas of support. The leg extended, this is called flagging out. As we can see the climber was able to bring the right hand over to a match at the hold and this one is placed underneath the handle where she places it as an under cling. This is when the climber is placing the hand from underneath and in order to create pressure and secure the grip the climber places the fingers far in and to the handle in order to squeeze the hold and Once the climber securing the grips she's able to bring the left foot at a high foot placement and is glancing over to the next hold at reach It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet to make sure that she applies accurate placement. This one because the climber eventually will have to stand up to gain height to perform the next hold at reach.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You want that shoulder to face more in this way compared to going out that way. It eliminates the ability to miss, it will make you more efficient in your accuracy, and it also will prevent the defender from being able to block your shot. You can see his shoulder is probably more going that way where he would want it to come more turned in this way, creating a better angle for the layup. The player starts out with a good base, feet shoulder width apart. You want to do that so you maintain good balance. You're able to get explosion with the left or the right foot. So that's why you want to have good balance and good footwork, shoulder width apart. As you can see right here. The player also does a great job of having both hands on the basketball. That secures possession against any defender trying to slap it away. Another area to note is he's not bending his knees enough as you can see and he's not getting off the ground enough. You really want to explode vertically, straight up and down to get the most explosive layup that you can possibly get. The closer you get to the basket, the more efficient you will be in your layup attempt. One area of improvement, as you can see, he needs to turn his shoulder into the rim right here. You want to turn more so that you can have a better angle to finish the layup accurately each time. So as you're attempting that layup, you want to turn your shoulder inward towards the rim instead of having it flat or outward. It gives you a better angle and it gives you more accuracy in finishing the layup.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Also, another thing, you start here, but you finish there. You want to stay stationary, finish forward versus left, right, or backwards. Right here, kind of a wide base here, so you want to be consistent there. But everything else is pretty good. The avoid flex there with the L shape. Almost seemed like he could have obstructed his vision here, but I didn't catch it in time. But you want to make sure if he did, just shift that ball a little bit to the right or bring it up over the right. Right here, picture perfect, straight up and down. Right feet still together. That's how you want it to be for balance purposes. Enough is said here. Open hand, pop that follow through. This is a great job, shoulder width apart, flexion in his knees. Got the L in his elbow, got the offhand here. I would say the ball is already in his hands, right? So his knees should already be bent. That way you don't have to catch the ball, then go down. If you're already down by the time the ball hits your hand, you're ready to elevate into your jump shot. So just kind of being ready to shoot when the ball hits your hand is ideally how you want to be versus moving as the ball is kind of placing in your hand. Picture perfect and it open, wrist is broken, followed through is there. This is a no-no. Finish the way you start.

Also bring in the player's shooting hand inside his body's frame, allowing his elbow to form an L-shape, aligning it towards the front of the rim, creating a more accurate alignment to guide the ball. On the release of the player's jump shot attempt on the left frame, we can notice that the player's follow through is being drifted towards the right side of the rim, which will allow the ball to go towards that direction. We will want the player to keep his follow through aligned towards the front of the rim to allow the ball to be guided accurately in the right alignment to get above the rim, creating the proper angle it needs to drop through the net. A few adjustments the player can make as we look on the right frame on his release is again have the player lift off the ground to allow the ball more accuracy, arc, and power to be guided properly above the rim creating an accurate angle of dropping inside the rim. As we look on the release of the player's jump, shot, attempt on the right frame, we can notice that again, we would want the player to jump on his release, allowing the ball to gain more arc, accuracy, and power it needs to get above the rim to have the opportunity of dropping through the net. This will allow the player to have more balance and lift on his jump shot, creating more arc and power to guide the ball above the rim. As we look on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player does a solid job on his attempted jump shot of having his follow through hand go downward in the direction of our target, allowing the ball to have the opportunity of staying in the correct alignment. As we look on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player is followed through. Momentum is guiding it towards the right side of the rim. This does not allow the ball to go in the right alignment it needs. Instead, allowing it to be drifted towards the right side, resulting in an incomplete jump shot attempt. On the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player does a solid job of getting his hand underneath the ball. A slight improvement we will want to make is to create a gap between the ball and the palm, having the ball rested on his fingertips, allowing a better release, creating more control, power, and alignment to help guide the ball above the rim, to be able to come down in the proper angle it needs, resulting in the completed jump shot attempt. As we look at the player go into his shooting motion on the right side of the frame, we can notice that since the player switched his shooting hand, he will now have to incorporate the correct footwork by stepping initially with his left foot first, and then having his right foot come down, going into his shooting motion. As we look at the release of the player's jump shot attempt on the right frame, a few improvements the player can make as we look at his follow-through is keeping it above his shoulder, aligned in front of his face, to be directed towards the front of the rim. We also can notice on the left frame that the player's follow-through is again drifting towards the right side of the rim, which allows the ball to do the same. We want the player to keep his follow-through in the alignment of the front of the rim to allow the ball to have a better opportunity of being directed accurately. Above the rim, creating the proper angle it needs to drop inside the rim. As we look at the player go into his shooting motion on the right side of the frame, some improvements the player can make to become more efficient on his jump shot attempts is to have his feet a little bit wider to allow more balance and control on the release of the jump shot. Also is to bring the player's elbow inside his body allowing his elbow to be more aligned towards the front of the rim to create and guide the ball into the right alignment allowing it a better opportunity of getting above the rim to create the proper angle of dropping through the rim. As the player is going into his jump shot attempt on the right frame again to help the player improve on his efficiency we want the player to Spread his legs a little bit wider to allow more balance and control on the release Also bring the players elbow inside his body frame Aligning it Towards the front of the rim We also want the player to implement the correct footwork By stepping initially With his right foot first and then secondly with his left foot going into his shooting motion Thank you for watching! As we look on the release of the player's jump shot attempt on the left frame, we can notice that the player does a good job of having his follow through come downward towards the target, which is going to be the middle point between the rim, allowing the ball to stay in the accurate alignment it needs to hit the proper area of the backboard, dropping inside the rim, resulting in a completed jump shot attempt. As we look at the player go into a shooting motion on the right frame, the player does really well at getting his ball placement above his shoulder. However, we want to tuck his elbow inside his rib cage, not having it outside of his body frame, allowing his elbow to be aligned towards the front of the rim, creating a better opportunity of the ball being directed in the accurate alignment it needs. As we look at the player go into shooting motion on the right side of the frame, a few adjustments the player can make to become more efficient is to implement the correct footwork.

As we look on the right frame on our players release on his jump shot another improvement the player can make To become more efficient is to jump on his jump shot Getting a good lift off the ground Which is going to allow the ball to create more arc and accuracy and power it needs to get above the rim To be able to have a proper Angle it needs to drop through the net resulting in a completed jump shot attempt", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This she does by lowering her center of gravity so that feet are placed high and when the climber is ready she will then push down onto the feet mostly on the right foot so that she's able to gain direction to the hole that reach and in that moment once the climber gets to engage onto pushing down onto the right foot forcefully then she will engage into bending the arms to get her center of gravity close to the wall later on having to transfer the weight to the left foot being in place once landing the left hand to the hole that reach The climber starts once the climber is no longer standing on the mat and the feet are in position on the wall. As we can see the climber is sending the left foot to come into place towards the right side of the block. The climber, once creating pressure of the left foot coming into place, then she will be able to raise the hips to apply the right foot over to the hold on the wall. The climber was only able to tap the hold with the fingertips. This was due to a lack of power when performing the jump, as well as the climber would have been more successful in sustaining the grip if she kept the left foot in place. The climber right now is chocking up her hands by placing the hands inside of the chalk bag, which is attached to her. And this chalk will help with gaining a better grip before sustaining the grips, as well as absorbing any moisture that may be coming from her hands. The climber in performing the dynamic move, she has slipped off from the left foot placement. This was due to a lack of pressure and the climber had pressed hard onto the right foot to go over in that direction at reach. Now it's all a matter of time and power that the climber has committed to make this committed move. So if the climber could potentially still make the landing of the hand over the lip of the hold if she had engaged enough power but because the climber has come off from the foot placement it can also retract the move and the climber will be unable to make the hand placement. Now that both feet are into position we can see the climber pressing onto the left toe so that the climber's center of gravity is pushed over to the right side. It's important that the climber's center of gravity remains underneath her grips. The reason why the climber is leaning back to extend the arms, this is called a wrist position because the climber is not engaging on the arms and it's a time for recovery. When the climber is ready she will engage then into a pull up engaging the arms to perform the next hold at reach. As we can see the climbers placing both of the hands into the same hold as this is a one-hold start. When both hands are in the same hold this is called matching. And she's sustaining to a large hold, this one being a jug as the climbers able to wrap the hands at the lip of the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Again, he shoots it over his right shoulder. We love to see this elbow more straight. And you can see it here, how he's not really squared up. His right hip is kind of facing this wall. Again, he's pushing off. We just love for him to pick up momentum here and really lift up higher. Here he goes. Better job here of looks like that left arm comes out. You know, he's raising up here a little bit. Love that his eyes and head are up. He does a really good job with that. Again, just very little lift. He's already down on the ground. Legs are kind of locked out. Let's bring this follow through so it's more straight. You can see how he's kind of, the elbow again is going out to the right. I mean, it starts right here, of taking that dribble, which he did, and really having a big stride and a big step on this left foot, and then elevate. He's just kind of going a little bit, I don't know, 50% speed here. He's got all the fundamentals, I think. Then we pick it up a notch and go a little bit more at a higher intensity. Heads up, two hands on the ball, that's good. As he lifts, let's just be a little more explosive. We just need more strength, leg strength here to push off and to really draw and pull that right hip up. Again, more lift, more power. He's shooting a little bit like over his right shoulder. You can see how the elbow's out, which means he's kind of hooking it. Let's get it more straight onto the basket. And we do that by pivoting when we land on that left foot to kind of use it to turn our body in midair to face the basket. Again, on this push-off, will he lift? Will he really pull that right hip up? He's got the little vulnerable here sticking the ball out. Let's get it in tighter. Love that he knows where he is, though. He knows where he is in relation to that backboard. Again, very little exploding up off the foot, if you will. The right knee's already down. It's not elevated up in the air. Again, he's shooting over this right shoulder. He's just kind of flicking it up there, if you will. You know, he's got the spacing, though. He knows the target and where he wants it to go. I guess at the end of the day, that's what matters, if the ball goes in or not. We'd love to see a little bit of some distance here between the feet, like a really big step here with the left foot with a little more space. That could help him with getting more lift and power, but really use this left leg to really explode to bring this right knee up. Love that he's got two hands on the ball and his eyes and head are up once more. Same thing here, not a lot of lift and power from the legs, really relying on this kind of hook shot over the right shoulder. I do love that his fingers are pointing following the ball, that's good, and he does a really good job of using the backboard here. Here's his follow-through and landing. Again, that elbow's out. We'd like it to see more extended to the basket. I like that he's got his arm bar at 90 degree, but you could see his landing. He's a little straight up, knees are locked out, feet are flat-footed. More cushion, kind of bouncy on the landing, I would recommend. Again, would love to bring this right shoulder in and have it more square, facing the basket. He kind of shoots it over his right shoulder. I really feel like he could lift up higher. Here the shooter is doing a right hand reverse layup. He is going off the correct foot, bringing the right knee up. Arm bar is bent, 90 degree is good. I would love to see him, like as he lands on this left foot to kind of pivot and square his hips and his shoulders up. He's kind of shooting over this right shoulder instead of pulling that right shoulder in a little bit more and shooting more straight onto the basket. Here he makes his way. This big left-hand step is crucial. Like a big ol' step. We need a big ol' step and a push-off to draw that right hip up. Two hands on the ball. Eyes and head are up. That's good. Again, shoots it over the right shoulder. You can see it here. He does land with more of a knee bend. That's really good. You could see a little bit in this view how he kinda shoots it around his right shoulder instead of squaring this right shoulder up. His right hip is still pointed out to this side wall. Let's bring everything in and square it up. We should see him shooting the ball right here. Instead, he's even out of the view of the camera because his arm is way over here. Anytime you've got all this extra distance you have to cover, there's a chance for it to get blocked or a chance for the accuracy of it to be thrown off. Again, same thing, shoots it over the right shoulder, on the landing he kind of locks it out. You know, I feel like he already should still, he should already, he should still be up in the air, the ball hasn't even touched the backboard and see, because he didn't jump he's already on the ground. So let's lift it up here, let's lift our body up and finish this shot. Again, pretty good spacing here between the feet. Let's really push off this left. He's gonna bring the right hip in. Love that his eyes and head are up. He's got a pretty good angle here. Two hands on the ball. Everything looks really good there. Again, I really would love to see more explosiveness here, like to really plant and go hard. Push off this left foot and really power this right hip up. And then he's doing a good job of bringing the ball up with two hands, his eyes and head are up, but we need more power, more lift. And it's about doing these drills, this particular drill, gain speed, that's what will get you that lift.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So this is kind of a smart idea to use, knowing that he's going into another comfortable set of hands, the climber used his natural momentum to kind of put him into the next position without having to find any feet. So here we can see the climber is getting himself ready of committing to the big dino move of going over to the screen hold here. In the starting position we can see that the climber was swinging from the right and all the way back over to the left. This is a really good thing to see just because by swinging himself from left to right this is allowing him to get a good understanding of the movement that he's trying to go for. Just because his hold is over to the right and above him by going back and forth and side to side that helps to really get an understanding of the movement he's going to be experiencing right now and then especially right now in this position just because his body is so far over to the left this is the best position to kind of start in before committing to fully dinoing to the first hold. Just because it helps to apply as much power as he needs by keeping his arms in a straight position and then keeping his legs in a bent position just because those legs are the best tool in order to get up into that green hold that he's aiming for. And so here we can see the climber was able to move his left hand up into the next handhold here I'm so in that position He was hanging on with the right hand and was able to find a high foot and it does seem like he placed both feet On the wall right here Ideally, it would have been better if the climber just allowed his right foot to kind of flag down and to the left So then that way you can just reinforce all this body weight on that high left foot But it could just be that this climbers pretty comfortable and he seems to continue use momentum in order to continue up in this boulder And so here we can see that the clamber has been able to make contact with that green hold and is especially hanging on to It with both arms. So in this position just because the dino It has happened and what naturally ends up happening is his feet do swing out and away from the wall But what we can see happening is the clamber is doing a couple things in order to kind of keep himself close to the wall One of the first things that he is doing is that as he grabs on to that green hold He's immediately trying to pull in to that green hold as much as possible And this does help to keep as much of his body closer to the wall and engage the hands a little bit better So they don't come swinging away from the wall on top of that we can see that both of the climbers legs are kind of in a bent position and One of the main things to that helps out with is it helps to keep control of his core strength Just because we can see that his core is still relatively straight So this helps to reinforce that he can bring his legs back into a controlled position And prevent any further swinging from it happening", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The final step in executing this salad is to toss all of the ingredients in the seasoning and the vinegar in order to coat them properly. And this is a salad that you would want to serve immediately. For his third step, he adds all of his vegetables to a mixing bowl. He is picking them up with his hands and transferring them to the mixing bowl. An easier and more efficient way to do this would be to pick up the cutting board and scrape all of the vegetables into the bowl with either your hand or your chef's knife. From this angle you can see that he has all of his fingers holding onto the tomato and exposed to the blade of this knife. That is an improper way to cut any vegetable. You should have your knuckles up against the blade of the knife and move the knife up and down in a motion across your knuckles so that you don't expose yourself to any injury. He cuts the tip off of the plum tomato and appears to attempt to make slices out of the tomato lengthwise. Here he is adding his vinegar, which appears to be one tablespoon. Vinegar is an appropriate ingredient in this recipe. Other acid alternatives would be lemon juice, lime juice, red wine vinegar, white wine vinegar. That's personal preference. Again, you can see the randomness of the way that he's cutting. He's got this group of cucumber that he's cutting into cubes and then he's still got four slices of cucumber over here that he didn't include in the group. This is making extra work out of what should be a simple slice. He continues to cut his cucumber into fourth inch rounds, which he then will attempt to slice into lengthwise cuts. To start this recipe he first gathers his ingredients, a small cucumber and a plum tomato. And in order to season the salad, he appears to add what's remaining in the bowl is half a teaspoon of garam masala or an Indian spice blend. Here you can see that his cuts are very haphazard and ineffective in executing this recipe at a swift pace. He has cut his tomato into quarters and then each quarter it appears that he's cutting them into like random half-inch pieces. But it doesn't have a method to it. It's very inefficient. However, this knife or saw is very dull because you can see as he cuts through the tomato, he has to pull the tomato out to even rip the skin to create an actual break in the tomato skin. Next, he grabs the tools that he will need to produce this recipe, which is a cutting board and a knife-like attachment to the cutting board instead of a regular knife.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

He has the choreography down, but I think the next step for him to get him to a 10 would be really getting his body and movement into the music and like really finding that flow and fluidity of this style of music, of the style of dance, and that just would have brought the performance to another level. But overall, really good job. So here again another body roll this time he's kind of jumping back and then swinging his arms around. So again I would say for here when he's jumping back in this body roll it would go from the feet all the way up so really like flowing that body, jumping from the feet so bending those knees would definitely help. I'm sorry bending the knees would help and then letting it pretty much affect the hips and then his back can move a little more and then the head would be the last thing that rolls. So here the dancer is spinning around. He does a really good job with just a nice clean spin around. And then once he lands, he lands straight forward. So really good job just controlling his balance in that spin. So in the salsa I would love for him to get up on his toes a little bit more with both feet just so he has a little more lightness to the step but really good job using his arms and kind of rotating those around and just staying nice and balanced in the center. I don't know why, but I think this was my favorite part with him because it was just so everything was frozen. His arms are up nice and high. His body is straight. He did a little spin around with his leg and then came out to the position. And then the only thing he moved was he had his right now he has his left foot forward and the toe is on the floor. The heel is up and then you just twist that toe in and out. So that way his knee turns in and then it goes back out. But it was a real like just freeze moment and then pop pop with the knee popping in and out, which is really nice. So here the dancer is jumping side to side, almost like a little short gallop. Really nice leg space. I definitely would recommend bending the knees a little bit more. And then just really like, yeah, I think if he bent the knees, that would just kind of bring a better level and ease for him to jump side to side. Good job with the arms swaying back and forth on that part. And then good eye connection to the audience facing front. So in this step the dancer steps out. Right now his weight is on his right foot, his left leg is back behind him. This is a quick like maybe half a second pose. The arm has been in front, this arm is nice and straight out with the fingertips straight, and he's also looking at his hand that is out. So just a really good job getting to this pose position for this part. So the dancer starts with just stepping out and then touching his toe to the side. Right now he has his right leg touching out, so just the toe of his, kind of the big toe of his shoe. And then rocking side to side and leaning to get in the groove of the rhythms. So here he's doing a salsa side to side. First he went to the left side and the right side. A really nice space between the legs and then he did a little shimmy shake with his arms and shoulders which is really nice to accent the drums and the music. So this whole first section, really good job just getting the basic fundamentals of the steps so they're really clear, nothing is muddled up. When he does the body roll, he kind of rolls starting from his chest. And with this style of roll, I would definitely start from the head and then work your way all the way down through your feet, so the roll looks like a snake from the top to the bottom. I do like that he has a bit of a head nod going on. I definitely think he can loosen up just a little bit in his upper half of the body. So really getting the full feel of this style of music, hearing all the drums, and trying to get his full body into the movement.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Because this movement is so fast, I would encourage this dancer, and they're moving so fast, I would encourage this dancer to think about placements. So statues, when you're moving this fast are really helpful, like pose and pose and pose and pose, hit and hit and hit and hit. Thinking about really being sharp and kind of still for half a second before you move on is important to make sure that you have that agility, keep that speed, but also keep that, the shapes of the dance so it doesn't become really kind of flowy and looks messy. The movement will look cleaner. I would encourage this dancer to send their hips back out further and plie even more because this movement is so fast. Good job to this dancer for really focusing on the foot articulation and thinking about when they use the ball and the heel. There's certain moments where it's not as clear, so I would encourage them to clarify throughout the entire dance, but for the majority of the dance, they have really great foot articulation. I would encourage them to increase their hip articulation to improve the overall look and feel of the dance. And since this is very proficient, those small details take it to the next level. Because this dancer is doing so much turning, I would encourage them to spot. So look their face in one direction or another direction and make sure they wherever they plan on laying they whip their head around first before the rest of their body follows. This dancer does a really good job of doing this heel toe where they've pressed the heel of their foot into the ground while their toe is moving. I would encourage them to again plie and to send those hip back even further so they can do this even faster and sharper to improve the overall look and feel of the dancer.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She was just doing that for her own memory's sake The dancers forgetting the choreography a bit, but it's doing a good job in trying to get back in rhythm and getting back to the part of the sequence in what she's supposed to be up to. The dancer is turning on her heel instead of turning on her toe, which would help her in her turn avoid friction and be able to get fully around back to the front of the room if she had her weight on her toe and then her eyes focusing to the front of the room. Again, the dancer is concentrating towards this side corner of the room where perhaps, I believe, her teacher, someone is standing that we can see or that she can see through the mirror. And the dancer should really be focused on herself and her body in this choreography and not some externalized person. The dancer's eye contact is very good here. She's looking straight ahead where she's supposed to be looking with that laser beam focus that she has with her eyes. Her arms also should have as much energy radiating both outward and upward in straight lines so she can remain feeling ease and comfort but also being strong at the same time. Again, we see what I'm talking about with her breaking her wrist, that her fingers here are pointing outward from her wrist being bent, instead of her fingers being in line with the rest of her arm. This movement which the dancer just swiped her left arm across should be a change of level and the choreography the dancer really should have gone lower to the floor. Right now her head is at the same level as it always was where she should have been bending her legs so that she can lunge to the floor and so her head really should have been lower and it would have been a change of level from originally a high level to a middle level. The dancer is also looking off to the side of the room where we hear her teacher who counted in at the beginning of the dance sequence. I imagine that she is standing or sitting that way, so she's looking at her for choreographic cues. But really, this changes the dancer's energy and her alignment of her spine. Her neck or her cervical vertebrae are now turned, whereas the rest of her vertebrae are in a straight line, and then it breaks when her head turns to the side. So instead, her head should be, or her eyes also should be facing forward so that her neck is in a straight line and her vertebrae is in one straight line, instead of looking and breaking the line by turning to face her teacher. The dancer definitely has a sense of ease when she's dancing through. She's not stiff when she dances. Her ribcage moves, her shoulder moves. She added some stylized elements. She just has to work on memorizing the choreography, not looking at her teacher and focusing where she's supposed to because it does change the whole shape of the movement when she's looking elsewhere that is not choreographed. She also can have more energy in her hands and focus on their positioning so that she's not breaking the line at her wrist. The dancer is moving her rib cage very clearly in circles, which is wonderful execution, but her hands are a bit stiff, just being held there with not her arms moving at all, which is okay if she's emphasizing her ribs in that way, but in doing so to make her hands a bit more relaxed and not stiff, so that I do concentrate on her rib cage circling instead of on her hands. Dancer does a great job here of being on her toes. Again, her heels are off the ground, which is why she's able to do these rotating steps in which she's twisting her body and moving towards her right. The dancer is doing a great job of having her weight on her toes as we see her heels are off the ground Which is why she's able to maneuver her knees Both to the right side and the left side with ease as well as with her hips to the right side and left side with ease Because she has her heels off the ground making her legs Available from the hips downward to be twisting and turning however. She needs them to be The dancer is adding extra head movements here, nodding her head up and down, which is a bit distracting from the movement that is supposed to be concentrated in other body parts and not necessarily her head and neck. Both the dancer's arms and right leg should have been extended outward in this position. Her arms instead are in fists and close to her body. And really everything should be pulling outward in this turn instead of being condensed inward. The dancer really does a great job of lifting her knee as the vocal of the music is accented. So the vocal comes to a height or a climax and that is the exact time when her knee reaches the highest point that it does in space. So her body is really mimicking the musicality and the lyrics here, which is great. She's basically another instrument in the music. The dancer's arms are a bit high at the start of this step. Her arms should be really making a straight line outward instead of a bit of an angled V position how she's making it at this very moment. She can work on this by pressing her arms downward so that they're in a complete linear line. Again, same thing here at her wrist. She's bent so that her fingers are going outward from her wrist instead of in line with the rest of her arm. She's actually doing it in both arms, both the right arm that I just noted with the spatial drawings as well as her left arm. She's doing the same thing here. The dancer is dancing with a lot of ease. She definitely feels comfortable and confident in her body. Just with the ease, it's nice that her arms are not stiff at all and they're very fluid. She just has to be careful that she's not bending her fingers too far or bending her hand too far at the wrist. We see how she's breaking her wrist so her hand is flicked downward, which is saying that she's comfortable, but it's breaking the line of her arm when her fingers are pointing downward that far.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This one, the left arm has come in between the wall and him and quickly to bring it up for the reach. However, the climber will need to make sure to wave the arm slightly away from the wall and to the left side. This to force more engagement of his body to be closer to the wall. And the other one is at the right foot right now it's being in place but as we can see he has made a push on the left foot to go up in the leap. Reason why the left foot has let go from the wall. So it's important that the climber brings his weight quickly over to the highest foot when making the pull as he makes the lunge. Here you can see the climber had made a slight change on his positioning where he no longer wanted to rely on the high foot placement only and instead has brought his left foot that was out on the flag to be placed down below this so that he can have two areas of support when making this stance up to the next hold. Now that the climber has secured the grip above being the right hand on the pinch, we can see how the climber now is making a foot switch down below, bringing the left foot that was out on the flag to be placed where the right foot was. The climber was able to make the move out of the start hold. He does this by bringing his right foot into the wall and he's no longer in the mat. So the climb has a start. And as we can see the leg, right leg is extended. And this is for the climber to keep balance. This is called flagging in. And so it will help the climber to shift his center of gravity to be pushed by the left foot being in place. The climber then brought himself in by making a forceful pull up and sending the left hand up to a pinch. If the climber was going to attempt this again, it was good of the climber to push on both of the feet but mainly on the left foot. This one to allow a leap up to the reach. But needs to continue to engage on the grip on the right hand and lock the move so that he can keep his chest towards the wall. And same wise to bring his hips over to the right side once making the stance to then be supported with the right foot. Once the climber gets to secure the grip above, then the climber can release any other limbs to make the next placement. It's important that when the climber is making the next move, he uses the highest foot to push down and this one as he is leaning back on the highest hold, right hand, then forces to bring his center of gravity being on the core to be raised by pushing down on the on the foot. This to prepare him to have a more effective reach when going up next to the hold. In this instance, the climber made the choice to swap his heel hook to be a toe placement instead. Since this is a big edge, the climber can do this switch comparably. Here we can see the climber making some hand gestures. This will help the climber to visualize what the sequence will be and when he will need to make the hand placement for each hold when on the wall. When the climber made the reach, was able to place the hand, however, was not able to engage on creating pressure to it due to the right foot. Once he was pressing on it, instead it was pushing him away from the wall. This will not help the climber to bring the center of gravity to the foot that's been placed above. So at this point, the climber will be going down, unable to sustain the grip above. Here we can see how the climber was able to secure the grip with the right hand this one being a pinch which he will need to lean back in order to create pressure for the fingers that are placed above and presses with the thumb underneath. This is called a pinch so he can clamp the grip meaning create force to then release pressure down at the feet which he did by bringing his left foot that was out on a flag to be placed where the right foot was and quickly brings the right foot into place this one by sending the heel in behind the hold edge. So this one heel hooks are usually known to be technical foot placements because will keep the climber stable almost acting as a third hand as we can see the right foot is placed at a highest stance. As a climber came to secure the left hand grip, he has to continually pull on the grips. This releases some pressure to allow a foot swap down at the foot chip below. The climber still needs to continually activate some pressure down at the feet to avoid from swinging out or detached from the wall. So he does this by first placing the toe onto the foothold by rolling in the toe onto the foothold as the left toe rolls out of the foothold and is released. As the climber is getting himself positioned to the start hold, this one being a one hold in which the climber is sustaining right hand being a pinch as the thumb is involved in pinching underneath, clamping the right hand for sustaining the move and the left hand is just placed above so the climber will have to create pressure by leaning on the hold. Now in order for the climber to start the climb he will have to bring both of the feet off the mat", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

It looks almost like, again, that this was choreographed, that it's not, that he's not just spontaneously doing this. And that's okay. I mean, when something's choreographed, it's choreographed. But with this type of dance, there still needs to be really strong intention behind every, with every type of dance, I guess. There needs to be an intention behind everything. But especially when you're a leader or you're a follower in a partner dance, there needs to be a lot of clarity about who's actually leading and following, even though you both know what the steps are supposed to be. And in this case, it looks almost like he forgot what the choreography was because he's really quickly having to make this turn happen in a way that's really not in line with the music and looks a little bit sloppy. Again, I think he's doing a good job of creating a nice strength here for her so that she can go out and come back in. But again, he's lost the step here. He's really just not sticking with the basic foundational step, and so it really loses the essence of what's meant to happen with this particular style. Also his super deep plie here, but standing on a flat foot is not in line with this technique. I would like to see him with a slightly bent knee and dancing on the balls of his feet to keep it light and smooth and also more technically correct for this style. They've just completed a turn and have done a good job of reconnecting here with these hands. And that's it. So, I hope you found this helpful. If you have any questions, please let me know. And I'll see you next time. Bye. So here she's done a better job of trying to mimic what he's doing in terms of the rhythm but also the step. So he's taking big steps with one foot and standing on a plie while straightening out the other knee with a flexed ankle and he's stepping relatively slowly, slowly relative to the music and this is the third or fourth time he's done that and now she's really finally kind of caught up with him there. So she took a big step with this leg and is on the same rhythm tempo as him. He's glancing at her which is great I wish she were looking at him that would just add to the connection here. Both of their frames look pretty strong in this moment so that's really helping to keep them connected here. So here this dancer is sort of just throwing her arm back. She brought it from the front and now she's sort of moving it in this direction and in a really again loose way, not a lot of energy coming out, not a lot of muscle use. It's a little bit like a throwaway arm and I just feel like if she's gonna do an intentional arm, it looks like she was doing this intentionally. If she's going to do an intentional arm, she needs to make it look really strong and intentional and give us more energy out through her fingertips. She's also been looking at the floor for quite a while as she's doing this step which we can see here with her gaze. And so again you know just finding a confidence and being really intentional and dancing with the whole body. Again, just a low energy from both of these dancers. There's not a lot of strength or oomph or pizzazz coming from either of them. His arm is just sort of held here at his side, a little bit tension through the biceps here. He's sort of just looking off into the distance, really in a deep plie here without being on the balls of his feet, so that's going to keep his dancing heavy. She looks very, very pedestrian here, like she's just going for a walk. This looks like just a very pedestrian movement. There's no interest with the arm. There's no interest with the gaze or the facial expressions. Again, this dancer is coming through around and it appears as if she's meant to be doing a step where her hips, one hip is turning out while the other turns in, which turns the feet in one direction, and then repeating to the other side and doing a little hip sway. She's achieving that to some degree, but it's very small and contained, which makes it look, just makes it look a little bit low confidence and there's no exaggeration or oomph to it, as well as the arm is just again not specific. It's sort of just going along for the ride. It appears as if she's attempting to bring it down and up, but because the elbows bent, the wrist is extended, the fingers are flexed, it really looks as if she's not super aware of exactly what's happening with her arm and that unintentionality takes away from the interest as well. Here we see another break in the dancer's frame at the shoulder. So it's really going to be hard for her to follow his direction because her arm will follow, but it'll be hard for the rest of her body to follow because of this broken frame here. Again, I just really want to encourage these dancers to be really aware of what's happening with every part of their body while they're dancing. And consider when they're creating a new image or a new shape or a new movement that they consider finding ways to make that movement a motif rather than these sort of one-off moments. And right now there's a one-off moment. She's for the first time has laterally flexed her cervical spine to her left in this sort of loose way. And she's not done that ever before in this choreography. And so again, looks like she's trying something new and she thinks it's going to look really fabulous, but it really doesn't. It looks really lackadaisical. It looks really unintentional, especially because nothing's happening with the arm and she's never done this with her head so far in the choreography. This is a pretty strong moment here. This dancer again has done a really good job of shifting her weight back With this straight elbow here, but this dancer has done a good job of keeping this really solid and strong in this moment It looks like he's not meant to be doing that weight shift that he is meant to keep his weight balanced And he's done a good job of that and that's partly because he's keeping this arm nice and strong So what he's doing here is kind of creating this Lever for her to pull against in this moment, which is great I just would love if this arm were at 90 degrees or in a V shape rather than sort of in this non Specific angle and I would love to see more energy out the fingertips So here the dancer, the lead has let go of the follow and we can see that as I mentioned in the previous recording, he really wasn't coming from a place of strength to actually guide her. And we can see that here because there was no energy in her, there is no energy in her arm. You can see that his arm is blurry, hers is not. And that's because he's letting his arm go which is why his is blurry. And hers is not blurry because it's not really moving because he didn't use any strength here to tell her arm what to do which would tell her what to do basically. And that's because he really broke his frame here and didn't come from a place of strength of directing her where to go. You can see that his arm is extremely twisted behind his back and again, that's not a place of strength to lead the follower from. She's done a good job of reestablishing the frame here so that she can continue following him in this turn that he's leading her through So now this dancer, the lead, is doing these big steps back, alternating with one foot in plie and the other one out straight with a flexed ankle. And this is another example of either he's not giving her a strong indication of what he wants her to do or she's not following very well because she's not doing what he's doing at all. It's like she's not picking up what he's laying down here. Here it appears as if the lead dancer has intentionally lifted up the knee in this moment. And I like that he's also glancing at her. So I think that this is an intentional shape that the follow did not really achieve in the same way. Again, it could have been a nice big moment, but because this dancer didn't do that same thing with her leg, she looks like she maybe tried to or did it a little bit. So I would like her to match the energy that he's creating here. Again, they're very, very close together here. I don't think either of them are holding a good frame with this side of their body. Again, he's gazing off in some direction, she's gazing off in the other direction. There's a disconnect there. So here I don't think either of them really know what they're supposed to be doing because she's just come across this way and did a little turn where she was not in contact with him anymore and they've just grabbed hands again. But he's not clearly pulling her or pushing her to indicate where he wants her to go and she's not really being pulled or pushed in any direction. So you know again as the lead he needs to be really clear about what he's asking the follower to do. Again, this dancer is alternating steps between this plie and this straight knee with the ankle flexed. And now it appears as if this dancer is realizing what's supposed to sort of be happening. So she is now mimicking the rhythm of his steps here, but she's not mimicking the shape of them. Again, her frame is really broken here at the shoulder. So that's one reason it's hard for her to follow, because when the frame is not strong through the, from the chest through the arm, it's hard to really guide people's entire bodies. He's more likely going to have success just guiding her in the arm, and that might be part of the problem here with her not following the steps that he's doing. Again, disconnect, right? They're not looking at each other. This is a nice moment here for this dancer. He's creating a shape here. He's doing a plie on one foot and bringing the other knee out straight with a flexed ankle. That lower half of his body looks really interesting. It's a nice shape. He's using the pelvis moving backwards as a counterbalance, but again I don't understand why he keeps looking away from her. I really think that there would be a much better sense of connection if he were looking at her and even more if she were looking at him. So here's another moment that really could have been a bigger moment. So he's just come out of a really quick turn under his arm. And she is pulling her weight away from him and lifting up her right knee really high. Again, there's no intentionality or shape with the arm, and so it really undermines the shape, the really good shape actually, that she's making with her knee. So I would have loved to see something happen different with the arm that looked intentional and had energy coming out through it. I don't like that the ankle is just loose here. Certainly there are some styles of dance where you just have a loose ankle. This would make a lot more sense as a flexed ankle or even a pointed ankle. I think this style of dance lends itself more to a flex here, just to, again, add some shape to it and more energy and strength to it. And also, this dancer is not contributing to her shape at all. He's just, again, standing there in a kind of a pedestrian way. So is there a way that he can emphasize her shape? Partly, one thing I thought maybe could happen here is she's sort of pausing here in this shape, but he's still moving his feet. Is there some sort of way that they could both pause together? Maybe he can pull back more through his pelvis to give her better counterbalance here, and maybe he makes a shape with an arm or a leg that would emphasize this moment for both of them. Another great moment where they're quite in unison with each other. They're continuing their basic step. They've both turned over their shoulder. They're on the opposite feet of each other, which is what we want to see. So good job staying in unison here. Here again, it appears that the follow is leading. They had just been holding hands here in a kind of basic position, and now she's pushed with this hand this way and pushed his hand away. And that's okay if she's the leader, but he's supposed to be the leader. So if what he wanted her to do was go in this direction, he should have been pulling her hand this way and then letting it go so that she knows, oh, I'm supposed to go this way now. Okay. So the weight transfer has continued here. So this dancer had his weight on his left foot and has now transferred to his right, or actually is in the middle of transferring to his right. You can see that he's still slightly on the left foot here, whereas this dancer has completely shifted her weight onto the left leg and is even leaning in that direction. Now, if he weren't here right now, this would be an excellent moment because she's really going for it in terms of keeping her weight on this leg. And that's what I really like to see when people are sharing weight like this. I would say something more interesting needs to happen with her arm, but in terms of her weight shift, this is excellent. He is not doing that very well. Maybe not. Maybe I should say yet, because who knows, maybe in the next moment he's going to get over there. But it doesn't really matter because she's done it before him. So one of them is early or one of them is late for whatever they're supposed to be doing here. And again, if he's truly supposed to be the leader, which is what most of this choreography is indicating, she's actually leading this moment right now because she's hitting it before he does. Here this dancer has lifted the right leg and we can you can barely see it here in this frame but this is his shoe coming back down. He's done a sort of little kick here again similar to the other dancers arm. It looks unintentional it looks sort of like a throwaway move. It doesn't really fit with any other part of the choreography so far. He's never done anything similar to that so it's not like repeating a motif or anything. The knee isn't really straight the toes aren't really pointed and they don't have to be necessarily but those are all things that could make it look more intentional and give it a little bit more interest. Another moment that was lost. This could have been another really big moment with a lot of weight shift with some kind of big arms and we can see that they have not taken advantage of this moment for the weight shift. Neither of them, well he actually does look pretty fully on this back foot, but the problem here is that his feet are super close together so it's going to be hard to really transfer the weight back onto this leg because the feet are too close together. She did a better job of taking a big step but she's kept her weight even on her feet if not a little bit on the front foot so they're missing the weight here, the weight shift here. They're missing any type of interest with the arms, both of their arms. Well her arms pretty loose and his looks a little bit tense still through the elbow so they've lost an opportunity to make to really emphasize this moment with some sort of you know big arm shape. I do like that they're looking at each other here that's helping to emphasize this moment. It's just that the the rest of it is just a little bit low energy and kind of missing the opportunity for a big gesture. He did a good job leading her in this turn as well. She just completed a turn and he just did a good job kind of directing her into that turn so she knew what was expected of her. This is good. They're actually doing the same step as each other. They're doing the correct feet. They're on the music and the timing. So I just want to commend them for getting on that step and being more connected there. He does a great job of helping her recover from that turn by keeping a nice strong arm here, and that has allowed her to stop the turn quite quickly and face him really quickly. So that was a good moment of leadership on his part. So here the follow has gotten a little bit stuck with the feet. Again, I think he needs to work a lot on what's the basic foundational step that he's trying to achieve, which I think in this case is a one-two, one-two-three, and to really use that as a very strong foundation so that even if he gets a little confused he's always on that foundation. In this moment he's just done a few little small mincing steps here as she's recovered from her turn, which is just not good technique. Whenever you're doing a style of dance like this, a social dance, a partner dance, it's really important that you maintain the basic step the whole time. And again here their steps are similar but they're not matching each other really. Although this is a pretty good moment, it's one of the better moments for the two of them in terms of matching what they're doing. So he's lifting his knee more than she is, she's kind of barely lifting her knee, but they are doing it at the same time and they're mirroring each other which is great for this type of partner dancing. A little bit of tension here through the elbow but in this moment it's kind of nice because it matches what he's doing. They both happen to be glancing towards the floor so I don't know if that was intentional but it kind of does look intentional because they're both doing it. Again, this dancer has done a 1, 2, 3, while this dancer has just done a 1, 2 with the steps, so the steps are not matching between the two of them. He did a good job, an effective job of leading her into this turn, so it was pretty obvious what he wanted her to do, which is great. Again, just a little bit of tension through here, too much of a plie, where is he looking, and this follow dancer is doing a good job of bringing this arm around, which if she keeps it close to her body will help her turn here. She's done a great job following through with the request of the lead. This turn position is pretty awkward. These turned in hips often occur when someone is attempting a turn if they're not prepared for the turn very well, and part of it is that she's on flat feet most of the time. This one looks like she's in the ball of her foot. It's because she's stepping down onto it, so it might be helpful to kind of get on the balls of the feet a little bit, keep the knees a little bit soft. So because she hit this weight shift before he did, he actually doesn't complete the weight shift. This weight shift really does, like I said, need to be in this sort of angle coming this way. And you can see that he did shift his weight onto his right leg, but he's just right over the right leg rather than away from her. And that happened because she hit this either too early or he hit it too late. So he was not able to fully reach his full weight shift potential. And that would make a really nice moment if they could both reach their full potential off of each other. That's kind of, I think, what was intended here and would look really nice. So there's a kind of a funky weight shift happening here. So this dancer, the lead has just put his weight temporarily onto this foot and has lifted the other. And she's doing the same thing as him. She's not mirroring him anymore. So it's creating a strange weight dynamic where the weight is now gonna be all shifted in this direction. And that's really uncommon for us partner dance. Typically the weight will either come in, but usually away from each other. So I'm not sure if one of them maybe is jumping the gun here or a little bit late with what they're supposed to be doing with the footwork, but them being on the same foot is a very unusual choice. And I'm guessing it's actually not a choice. I think it's maybe a mistake. They did another good job here of reconnecting after intentionally losing their connection. Again, this dancer here, neither of them are dancing with their whole body. I don't think she's aware of what's happening with her arms or even the positions of her legs. They're both kind of, she's looking down and he's kind of looking at her. There's just not a lot of energy or interest to this moment. Here the dancers again are disconnected. The direction that the lead tried to give the follow isn't very clear. I don't think she fully understood it in terms of what she's supposed to do in response. And he also did a strange movement with his feet here that didn't really fit with the music. They reconnected here really nicely. She didn't, the follower did not move very far away from the lead after he disconnected from her with the other arm, or no, it was the same arm, but they were, oh, that's right, he was connected with her using this arm and let go. So my point is that she didn't move too far away from him that she would miss this next moment, which is really great, and he reached out and they were able to find each other really quickly to reconnect in their hands. So here it appears that the lead is trying to direct the follow into something. This is not an effective way to lead for multiple reasons. This is a super awkward position with the shoulder here. From this position, there's not a lot of strength or power that he can use to move his arm in either direction. So it'll be really difficult. If this wasn't a choreographed piece, it would be really difficult for the follow to know what he intended by this. And that is creating, again, a lack of connection, a low energy here between the two of them. Again, if this was not something where the follower knew what they had planned to come next, this would be a really ineffective technique. Here again, this dancer has just done a really throwaway movement with the arm. I really, really want to encourage her to find some ways to make her arm movements much more strong, much more intentional, much more energized. \u3054\u8996\u8074\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f So here this dancer is doing a step that goes one, two, three, and this dancer is just doing a step, step. So they're not matched in their basic step and that's gonna that's contributing to this sense of disconnect that we're getting from these dancers. It does appear that he's leading her with this push through here his through his hand here which is what I'd like to see so I think that he is leading and she is following in this moment. That was a great turn. It was a little bit slow at the beginning and then came out quick and then back into this elongated position here. So that was really great, especially the follow is executing this really well. And this recovery here that she's doing is really lovely. It's super dynamic, as you can see, because her whole body is engaged and you can tell she's moving because her ponytail is flying in this direction. I love that her weight has really shifted back onto this leg in a really big exaggerated way while the front leg is out with a flexed ankle. The strength is really nice through her arm and also through her frame at the shoulder joint. Although this arm isn't doing anything really big, it does look pretty specific and intentional. Maybe a little bit of tension through the wrist and fingers, but I think this is one of the better arm positions that she's been able to achieve so far. Here this dancer has gotten a little bit thrown off balance and that's partly because she's again breaking her frame at the shoulder and so that's really hard place to move from in a partner dancing because it only will when when the leader moves the arm it's more going to move the arm than the whole body. Again, just really want these dancers to think about, you know, what's the shape or what's the intention they're trying to do with their arm shapes. For the most part, I don't think they're really aware of what's happening with their free arm. In this case, this dancer is doing this circle with his arm, with his shoulder that looks really unpolished, looks a little bit like he tried to do something with his arm, but has not really been instructed how to make an interesting and intentional looking arm shape. He does, he's circling this shoulder twice. And the reason it looks kind of unintentional is because it's a little bit loose, a little bit lax. There's not a lot of energy coming out through it. And I can see that because the elbow is sort of bent. There's no, you know, line coming out through the wrist and hands. So it just looks a little bit unprofessional. Not exactly sure what was intended here, but they've lost each other in terms of the steps that they're doing So he's done these exaggerated crossed over steps, which will actually look really cool because in addition to Exaggerated crossover. He's also putting his weight of his pelvis more away from his follower And they were pretty much in time with the music as he was doing this But she was not doing the same exact thing Although it looked like maybe she was trying to cross over her feet at the same time as him But she took slower steps than him and she is tilted away from him, but more at the shoulders So it's a little unclear whether he just sort of threw this at her and was like I'm just gonna try something fancy and it was hard for her to Follow or whether she forgot what the choreography was or something. It just looks like an unintentional Now here, they've stepped in towards each other, but there's this strange sort of pause that they're both doing here with their feet. They've lost the basic step. Usually with a social dance like this one, a partner dance, there's a basic step that is repeated, and that's the foundation for all the steps. And there's usually not much deviation from that. And if there is, it still stays in line with the rhythm of the steps. And this pause here looks unintentional as if they are sort of having to re-catch their balance. Again, a weakness through the frame of their arms here. A couple of things about this moment. This dancer is doing a one-two-three step again and this dancer is not really doing anything specific. He's sort of standing there and then he's taking a step. So he's not matching her steps which this could be a really cute moment if their steps were matching. But regardless he really needs to focus on continuing to do the basic foundational step the whole time. Or if he's choosing intentionally not to, to get back on the correct rhythm with whatever he's supposed to be doing. Oh and also this is another opportunity where she could have done, actually they both could have done something a little bit more interesting with their arms and put a little bit more energy and oomph into what they're doing here. So here's another repetition of this similar step from before that I think is meant to be one hip turned in the other one turned out so both toes face the same, both sets of toes face the same direction and then the other way around. It can be a really really cute step. One thing is her steps in this are way too big to make that step effective. She really needs to take small little steps which makes the emphasis on the hips even stronger and it was really just more in line with that particular step. Also dancing on the balls of her feet will also keep it nice and smooth and emphasize the hips more. She's trying an arm thing and I like that her elbows straight and she's making a pretty strong arc here so that's a good that's good for her but again the energy is not coming out the fingertips. She's got an extended elbow, extended wrist which is breaking the line that she's trying to establish. So we can see that in if I draw a line from the shoulder out at the wrist suddenly here and then at the fingers this way because the fingers are flexed. This dancer I think holds a lot of tension in her hands and wrists most likely because she's not super experienced or is focused on other things or something. So again finding ways to engage through the whole body and be really intentional about shapes. I think again this is meant to be a big moment and it's a moment that they lost. So he is pulling her, well basically he's creating a counterbalance with his of his weight with his right leg and he's extended his arm here and in response she's doing the opposite so it's this kind of counterbalance weight that they're creating with each other here. Again this is an opportunity for something big to happen because this is a big moment and it's a big moment because they're far away from each other all of a sudden there's this counterbalance that's happening and so this could have been a really nice emphasized moment but they've lost that. It has to do with the shape of her arm here is not intentional it's just sort of lax through the elbow and shoulder as well as the wrist and fingertips here. He's not really adding any interest with any shape or energy through his body. Again they're gazing in different directions from each other. She did not fully get her weight back onto that opposite foot so he's got his weight on his right foot her weight should be on her left to create this counterbalance here but her weight is sort of on her left foot it looks like it's a kind of balance between the two feet but she didn't step back with that left foot so I would have liked to see that there. I would like to see something happening through her her arm maybe his arm something more intentional about their gaze maybe they're both looking straightforward or maybe they're looking at each other here something like that and also want to point out that she's broken again here at this at her frame of her shoulder. This is a better weight transfer moment. This is they're repeating this in and out weight transfer Step and this is a better weight transfer. She's pretty much all the way fully out at her full weight. And so is he I would say he So what's happening with him is that he does have his weight on his right leg But he's twisted his pelvis and I can see that because the contour of his gluteus here is kind of more in this direction whereas his Right leg is this direction which means that this hip is kind of more on the z-axis towards this window and So what that tells me is that this twist of the pelvis is making it so that he actually can't Fully shift his weight in the way that she is doing here Which means that he's just got his weight centered over his foot and that's not what's meant to happen in these weight shares It's supposed to be more like what she's doing where you're coming out at a diagonal", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So all your weight is mostly on the left full foot and then just the right toe of the foot. And then also bending his knees more so as he steps back and rolls, his body roll is coming from the bottom up. Right now this is where he appears really stiff. So also using that breath just to help loosen his body up. So here the dancer just did a little body roll and then stepped out and he had his arm out to the side. His arm was really sharp out to the side so a really nice contrast from the fluidity of the body roll into a nice sharp arm to the side. So overall, nice job with this dancer. He does feel a little stiff, so I think if he just breathed into the movement a bit more, that would help to just loosen up his body and also bending his knees and just really just getting into the flow of the music and not being so technical to where there's no personality included in the movement. So here the dancer is stepping side to side and he's kind of bobbing his head a little bit to help with the flow of his body. I think if he just use his breath a little bit more relaxed as part of his body a bit more because he's doing a good job bending his knees but I think that would just help the overall flow of his movements. So right now he does a little step back and twists out his left leg so his heel is off the floor. His knees are nicely bent. I do like that he has really sharp arms coming up so he's really good at arm work, keeping them nice and sharp and in place. So here's another part where I think his breath could have helped. He gets like the the gist of the step but I just think kind of taking a breath whenever he reaches his arms back and forward just breathing into that movement so it's a little bit smoother and lighter. So here in a salsa step he's stepping forward and back. I like that he's rolling his arms around in a circle. It just kind of helps with keeping the beat of the music.

Again, players dribbling action is relatively fluent, keeps the ball close, shows good technical foundations but again as we're dribbling we want to continue to see the same actions as he's preparing for a skill. So toe down, heel up so we can really make contact with the laces of the ball through the middle of the ball so we can get into a more regular running pattern as he's dribbling towards preparing. You can see obviously the feet are relatively close together so that's going to obviously show the speed that the player is travelling at and the preparation so we want to always try and stay as low to the ground by getting this, if he's dribbling with his right foot, right knee over the ball, bend his left knee, get his hips low to the ground, get his body leaning slightly forward with his head position and his chest in line with the ball so as we're travelling forward our body is moving forward with the ball and it gives ourselves the best possible chance to maintain our balance, protect the ball, change direction at speed. I like the player is not just solely focused on the ball, you can see the player's head up as he's dribbling so keeping the ball in the lower extremities of the vision but also keeping his head up to look around and see where the space is, where the defenders are. As the player is executing the scissor, we can see the player does get into a lower position with his left knee. Right leg for me is still slightly too straight as he is doing the scissor. Again this is related to the ball rolling and the placement of the left foot in preparation for the scissor. The further forward that left foot can be planted, we can get our body closer to the line of the ball, get our knee slightly bent as we are moving our right foot around the ball which will help us with the next action in terms of stepping and then pushing off and changing direction. I want the body to still be moving in the direction of the ball so we lean our chest forward, head so it's closer to the line of the ball. Just gives ourselves better opportunity to protect the ball, change direction and speed. It's also important in terms of a skill to change direction that we are looking to disguise the skill so we are trying to make the defender go one way so we create space to go the other. So as we bend our knee, it's also an opportunity to move our body, drop our shoulder. So we are going to step to the left, we want to try and drop our shoulder to the left, make the defender go one way, create the space to go the other. So with the use of the scissor, we will step over, bend our knee, drop our shoulder to the right so we create the space to go the opposite. Play again just preparing to conduct a scissor skill so the approach is important so when we're dribbling we want to try and keep the ball close as we're about to execute the skill we want to slow down, slow the direction of the ball down so we can have full control and then change speed after the skill. So the player here you can see toe pointing slightly down, he's still pushing the ball a little bit closer to the toe, we'd like him to get a little bit closer to the ball, push the ball with his laces, put the knees in a good position, we can be a little bit lower to the ground, sink our hips, get our chest leaning slightly further forward so our head and our chest is over the top of the ball so as we're dribbling in this direction our body position is moving in that same way. So the player is in a decent position here as he's preparing to execute the 1v1 skill. Again, the players is executing the scissor. It's pretty fluent in his motion, but again, just because of the speed, the players traveling at the intent, because the left foot plants kind of alongside, slightly behind the ball. As we do the scissor, we end up with this straight leg going around the ball. So as this right leg is going inside the ball around to the outside, I'd like to see the player's body position lower to the ground, chest still leaning forward, slight knee bend in this right leg as he goes around. So the time to get around the ball, plant this right foot down and push off in the opposite direction is gonna be less, so we can be more effective in the skill. You can see the players dribbling technique is generally okay. The speed obviously we're travelling at is a little bit slower, more change in direction than dribbling at speed. So I'd still like to see the player dribbling a little bit lower to the ground. We can see very upright body position as he's changing direction, dribbling with his foot in a decent position to control the direction of the ball. I just want to see the player dribble more with the laces, his toe down, heel up, so we can get this knee over the ball and dribble with a lower centre of gravity, bend the knees, drop the hips lower, so we have better balance, better control, better ball protection, better ability to change direction with speed. Again, as the player is slowing down, ready to execute the scissor skill, we can see the preparation step with the left foot, as he's going to execute the scissor with the right. Again he's kind of behind and level with the line of the ball, so remember the ball is rolling forwards. So when we're looking to do the scissor, if we can step in front of the ball, then obviously as we do the scissor, that's going to help our body position in terms of being over the ball, bend that knee, have that effective change of direction and speed. The player here, you can see in a very upright position, so we want to bend this left knee, get it further forward, keep our hips low, keep our chest leaning slightly forward, so it's kind of in line with either the backside of the ball, if not the middle of the ball, so we're just moving in unison with the direction that we're dribbling. Play again just executing a Cruyff turn to change direction. It's not really going into the Cruyff turn at full speed but again we can see body position, straight leg with the standing leg, straight leg with the the Cruyff turn so that leads to an upright body position. We want to try and make sure when we're dribbling changing direction, executing any skills, bending our knees, lowering our hips, getting our body centered with the ball so whichever direction we are traveling with our body is turning and moving with it so as he does the Cruyff turn brings that right foot around the front of the ball, makes contact with the front of the ball to push it through the legs so the technique in itself is okay in terms of the contact with the ball and the action but obviously the body position very upright we can be a lot lower to the ground have a lot more opportunity to protect the ball, change speed, change direction. As the player prepares to execute the Cruyff Turn, the Cruyff Turn is just where we are obviously changing the direction of the ball, so we're travelling forwards and we want to change the direction of the ball to go 180 degrees behind us. The Cruyff Turn is where we want to make sure we bring this right foot around the front of the ball, start to turn our body, use the inside of the foot with the front of the ball to pull the ball back through our legs and behind. So important as obviously the ball is rolling forwards that the non-kicking foot plants slightly in front of the ball so we don't end up doing the Cruyff Turn reaching for the ball. So here the left foot is slightly behind the ball so we're going to end up reaching a little bit, but we can see the player starting to bend his knees, bring that right foot around, slowing down, getting his body starting to lean back towards the direction he wants to go, which is hopefully going to help him change direction and change fluently with both the body and the ball. Players just finished the scissor action with the right foot around the ball, stepping to the side of the ball. There becomes a slight knee bend in this right leg. You can see the body is starting to lean in the direction he wants to go. As he's bringing this left leg inside the ball, that's an opportunity to bend this right knee, drop our right shoulder down. So we pull the defender one way to create space to attack the other. Obviously, we're bringing the left foot inside to push the ball away in a forward direction to the left. So again, we can see the body position of the player is a little upright in terms of the action itself. But the player shows good, solid technical foundations that, given an opponent, potentially would improve the technical actions. Just looking at the execution of the scissor, again as the player is bringing his right foot around the inside of the ball to the out, scissor itself is okay. I'd just like to see slightly closer to the ball, slighter grade at knee bend so we can bring our hips lower to the ground through the skill. Just allows us better balance, better control, better ball protection and also allow us, obviously if we're going around the ball with a straight leg at this point, it's just going to take a little bit longer for us to get the right foot out to the side of the ball, bend our knee so then we can push off in the opposite direction. So, a little bit lower to the ground, lower hips, keep his body leaning slightly further forward and that will give him the most effective way to execute the skill in a game situation. Players use the Cruyff Turn for change of direction. Cruyff Turn, just bringing that leg around the front of the ball, making contact with the inside of the foot, with the front of the ball to push the ball through the legs. Important as we make contact, that as we're changing direction of the ball, our body is changing direction as well. We want to try and stay as low to the ball as we can, bend our knees, low hip placement, and on contact, players doing a good job of turning his body with the ball. So as the ball leaves his feet, he can move fluently with the ball at speed. Yn ymwneud \u00e2'r chwaraewyr, mae'r gwaith sysa'n mynd o le i'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd.

Again, as the ball is slowing down slightly as it's travelling, we can see there's a slighter knee bend now in the left leg, but it's still relatively straight. So it just shows an impact on where the right foot, the standing foot plants. We can see there's a slight knee bend in that right leg, but we're still upright in our body position. So we want to try and get forward, lean our body forward slightly with the direction of the ball and execute the skill so the ball is a little closer to our feet so we can have this slight knee bend in the left leg. So as that left leg comes around the ball now, when we plant that left foot to the ground, we're going to have that opportunity to push off that and get a better position to balance, protect and change direction with speed. So looking at the execution of the scissor, so for me we want to try and stay as low to the ground as possible and keep our body momentum moving forward. Here you'll see because the ball is rolling and obviously the preparation step to the side of the ball was kind of levelling behind it. We're now doing the scissor now with a straight leg around the ball from inside to out. So the scissor itself is not too bad but we want to try and get our body moving forward, lower centre of gravity, bend our knees, can we get our chest leaning slightly forward in the direction that the ball is travelling and be in a position where we can slightly bend our knee as we're coming over. So as we plant that right foot down to the ground that's going to allow us to disguise the skill, accelerate as well as protect the ball. So the player is just preparing to do the scissor action again. We can see in the dribbling motion, the player is not necessarily dribbling at game-related speed, but keeping the ball close, staying tight with the ball to his feet, which is obviously important, so he can change direction when he's looking to. We can see as he's dribbling, still pushing the ball a little bit with the toe areas, he's preparing, slowing the ball down. Still like to see the player dribble more with the laces, toe down, heel up. So we just maximise the contact surface between the foot and the ball. Again, the body is in an OK position with the knees slightly bent. We'd like the player to get a little bit lower as he's dribbling, especially in preparation for a skill. Get this body lower to the ground, leaning slightly forward so his chest and his head is in a more stable position over the top of the ball, just so we are moving in unison with the ball and dribbling with effective speed, balance and control. So just finishing off the scissor action, so the player comes around the ball with the right leg, I like the footwork in the players action, very light on his feet, balls of his feet, lands on the right leg, slight knee bend in the right, brings the left foot inside the line of the ball ready to push the ball away, so it's important that when we bend this right leg as we step out and bring this left foot away, that when we push away with the left foot with the ball, that that right leg is in a good position where we can push off that back leg to attack the space with speed. You can see the players body position is obviously bending his knees, starting to lean towards the left hand side, if anything we just want that body to be leaning slightly further forward and really then push off into that space, get our body, our hips and our chest starting to lean in the direction that we want the ball to go so we can effectively change direction at speed. Again, it's looking at the approach for the skill. So we've obviously slowed down, kept the ball close. Remember the ball is traveling in a forward direction. So it's gonna affect where we wanna plant our left foot. In this case, as we do the scissor with the right. So we are stepping to the side of the ball with the left foot. Again, if the ball is traveling forward, we wanna make sure that we are stepping slightly in front of the ball. So then we can bring this right leg around from the inside to the outside of the ball with the right leg, without the ball going too far away from us. So you see as the player's slowing down, he's getting into a more upright body position. I want the player to stay low, bend his knees, sink his hips, keep his chest leaning slightly forward. So his body momentum is moving in the same direction as the ball. And then he can utilize that left knee bending, dropping the left shoulder a little bit further down to disguise the scale, to create space to go to the right or the left. The player here just in preparation to execute a Cruyff turn to change direction. We see his general dribbling technique, not necessarily with the laces, more just to keep the ball close, small touches. Now redirects the ball, we can see the foot position here, toe pointing out, hitting the ball close to the big toe. So we're not dribbling necessarily with speed, just more dribbling to maintain direction and control with a soft touch. We can see obviously as the player is looking to change the direction of the ball, the knee position is moving out and in, which is fine. Obviously the foot position is going to redirect the ball, change the direction of the ball coming out this way. Bending our knees, dropping our hips is important to maintain a low centre of gravity as we are preparing to change direction or dribbling. Just want to try and keep that body leaning slightly forward in the direction that we are travelling as we prepare for the skill. And just talking about the general dribbling technique of the player, ideally when we're dribbling in straight lines, we're effectively looking to dribble with our laces. So pointing our toe down to the ground, heel up, that helps us get our knee over the ball, bend that knee, get our hips low to the ground, bend this left knee, get our body, here you can see leaning slightly forward, head in line with the ball. By dribbling with our laces allows us to move in a more fluent running action. Obviously when we're using this area by the little toe, towards the top of the foot, our ability to push the ball and run with the ball at speed is limited and also the control over the ball is just limited because of the amount of surface area and contact between the foot and the ball. Again we can see the player executing the scissor, again because where the left foot planted and the direction the ball is rolling, we're now doing the scissor with a straight leg in front. So by the time that right leg comes around the ball and lands, the ball obviously is going to continue to travel and it's going to just make it harder for us to move effectively with the ball, change direction at speed. So we want to obviously get that non-kicking foot, the left foot, when it plants to prepare for the scissor a little bit closer to the ball. We can see the body position, very upright, so we want to try and stay as low to the ground as possible, bend our knees, get our hips low to the ground, keep our chest leaning slightly forward throughout the dribbling action and obviously if we're going to step to the right, be prepared to now drop our right shoulder as we're moving our right leg around the ball to disguise the skill and create space by moving the defender where we want them to go. Again, player just finishing off the single scissor, but he's gonna be going into a double scissor. So whether he's gonna attack the space or go into a double scissor, he still want this right foot. As this right foot finishes moving around the ball from inside to out, still step slightly in front of the ball. As we step to the side of the ball, wanna bend this right knee, keep our body low to the ground and the ball. As we're bringing this left foot inside the ball, we wanna be dropping our, bend as we bend our right knee, we'll drop our body to the right hand side, which makes the defender move with us. So we create the space where we want the ball to go. So it's important that the player continues to keep his body moving in preparation for creating the space as he's executing the skill. Here you can see the player as he finishes off the scissor with the right, he steps in a good position wide of the ball. By stepping wider of the ball, allows the player to now bend this right knee, drop this right shoulder, potentially pull the defender this way to create space to go the opposite. And then obviously by bending the knee, brings our hips lower to the ground, lower centre of gravity, better balance, better control. So although the right leg is in a better position, still want his body to be leaning towards the right, so right shoulder dropping down as he brings his left foot inside the ball to push the ball away, just added disguise, balance and control to be able to push off. And just looking at the player's preparation before executing, this time a double scissor. So we can see the dribbling action. The player is controlling the ball well, small touches, keeping it close, able to manipulate the ball, change direction when he wants to. And we can see again the player utilising more the toe area and the outside of the foot just to redirect the ball, keep it close. When we're dribbling, I'd like to see the player with his toe down, heel up, knees in a good position. You can see the running stride is getting a little bit larger, so we're moving with a little bit more speed. So we just want to keep our body in a low position, hips low, bend our knees, get into that running stride, get our chest leaning slightly forward with our head in a position closer to the line of the ball. But the player in terms of dribbling in this forward direction is in a good position working on the balls of his feet, moving quite freely, keeping the ball close with small touches. Here a very good example of the Cruyff Turn. So we see the non-kicking foot and his preparation is stepping slightly in front of the line of the ball which is going to help the body position get closer to the ball and more centred. Obviously the action of the Cruyff Turn bringing the right leg around the outside of the ball to the front of the ball presenting the inside of the foot with the front of the ball to push the ball through the legs. You can see here that the right toe is pointing out and the body is already with this knee bend here and the body and the hips you can see are already turning in the direction, facing the direction the toes are pointing which is going to allow him as he pushes his ball through his legs to turn onto the ball quickly. You can also see in some of the prior Cruyff Turns he's reaching for the ball with a straight leg in an upright body position here, much better position with his knees bent, hips sunk, body in a more centred position with the ball so the player is in a better position to maintain his balance and change direction with speed. Player moving into the double scissor action. So again, as we're dribbling or changing direction or executing a skill, I wanna see the player really bending his knees, keeping his hips low, again, his body leaning forwards in the direction of the ball and see the ball is traveling forwards and the scissor action is gonna, obviously if he's doing a scissor around the ball inside to out, it will be to effectively pull the defender one way, create the space to go in the opposite direction. If our body is upright and leaning backwards as we execute these skills, it's gonna affect our ability to change direction at speed. Again, player in the middle of the Cruyff turn action, so he's not really disguising the skill to change direction at speed, so coming from an upright position. But just like most of the dribbling skills and dribbling in motion, we want to try and be as low to the ball as possible, bend our knees, lower our hips, keep our body centred over the ball. So as we change direction, we can change speed, protect the ball, change direction. You can see as the player brings his right foot around the ball, his body is starting to turn around, which is good. So not waiting until after the contact to turn is important to reduce the time it takes to change the direction of the ball and move onto the ball at the same time. But obviously the player here is in a more upright position, so that's going to limit the player's ability to maintain full balance and be able to explode away at speed. And just finishing off the Cruyff turn action, you can see as he finishes the action, as the ball's rolling back, he's already moving onto the ball. He's in a much lower body position, knee bent, obviously pushing off this back leg in this moment. Hips are a little bit lower, body's leaning forwards in the direction that the ball is going. So it's so important when we're dribbling, changing direction, that as we're making contact with the ball or we're changing direction, our body is moving with the ball at that moment so we can effectively travel with more speed, more control, more effectiveness. a chwarae yn gyflawni cryfder, felly dyma'r pwynt cyntaf gyda'r cryfder. Yn ogystal \u00e2'r ball yn ymdrechol, mae'n bwysig i ni ddod o'r llawn i'w dde. Ond rydyn ni'n dechrau'n ddod o'r llawn i'w dde, felly byddai hyn yn effeithio ar ein gallu i newid ymdrechion ar gyfer y cyflwyniad.

Felly, wrth ei ddod i'r ball, mae'n meddwl y bydd e'n ystod yn well i ddod i'w llawn. And as we're preparing now to finish the scissor action, we wanna make sure that as we step around the ball with the right foot, this right foot goes forward and to the side and we bend our knee, drop our right shoulder as we're bringing this left foot on the inside of the ball. By dropping the right shoulder, bending the right knee, we'll disguise the skill to make the defender think we're gonna go one way, create the space, and also get our body in a position where we can push off and attack the space in the game or even change direction and move away based on what the player's doing in this activity. Here you can see a straight leg on landing, body up straight, so in terms of executing the skill with high proficiency in game relatedness, he's lacking that final piece in terms of the disguise and the change of direction and speed. Again, player just preparing to do the scissor skill. So once again, think about the ball is moving forward. So player is stepping to the side of the ball with the left foot and see that the foot is level with the ball as the ball is rolling. So that's gonna affect the scissor action when we move this foot around the ball and that we can execute the skill with the most effect. So we wanna try and get this non-kicking foot, the left foot planted slightly in front of the ball, slightly further away so we can bend our knee, give ourselves that room to really exaggerate the skill, bring that right leg around, get lower to the ground. Obviously the closer the left foot is to the ground, the more difficult it is gonna be to bend those knees, get our hips low and start to get our body lower to the ground for better ball protection, speed and balance. So again, just looking at the preparation as the player is preparing to do a single scissor. So the approach and the dribbling technique with the ball is important. Can we keep the ball close to our feet, small touches as we're preparing to do the skill. So slow down before the skill. Can we get our knees in a low position? So bend our knees, sink our hips, see the body position here is better, chest leaning slightly forward, head in a position over the ball, so the player in a much better position to dribble. Just like the toe to be pointed slightly further down, so we're making contact with the laces through the middle of the ball, not necessarily pushing the ball closer to the toes, just to get a cleaner dribbling pattern with the right foot. If we dribble with the laces with the toe down, we're just replicating more of that running motion that we're naturally running with the player in terms of his preparation to execute the 1v1 skill, the scissor is in a good position. and preparing to execute the scissor skill. So obviously any type of 1v1 skill is to disguise a skill, make defenders go one way, create the space to go the other. So obviously if we're stepping to the left side of the ball, we wanna try and exaggerate the movement. So we step out to the side of the ball, so the defender thinks that we're gonna go this way, which will create space the opposite. So as we step to the side of the ball, we wanna make sure that we understand that the ball is rolling away. If we step behind the line of the ball that the player is doing here, that's gonna affect the outcome of the scissor. So we wanna step in front of the line of the ball, step to the side, definitely have a greater knee bend. So we bring our body lower to the ground, hips lower. We can see the body is upright. We still wanna be moving in the direction of the ball. So lean our chest slightly further forward so it's in line with the ball. Get our head over the ball, so we're maximizing our speed and effectiveness in the dribble. So the player is finishing up the double scissor. So obviously the ball is slowing down due to the time the ball is traveling the speed. The player entered the skill. We can see the player again in a somewhat upright position, slowing down, you can see his back up straight and maybe leaning back a little bit, straight leg with the scissor skill. So we wanna make sure that we maintain speed momentum throughout the skill, so we can change direction effectively with speed. So we do that by again, keeping our body low to the ground, bending our knees, dropping our hips, getting our body moving with the direction of the ball, either in disguise or finishing up the skill. Player slightly better position here for some of the previous scissors you see there is a slight knee bend in this action based on the speed that the ball is travelling. You see the proximity from the non-kicking front of the ball allows the player to bend that knee slightly which is going to help as he finishes off this action from going around the inside of the ball to the outside. That he can plant his foot in a position and get his knee bent on the right side where he can drop his right shoulder and create the space by moving defenders one way and give himself a stable position to now push off and attack with the left foot. You can see the left knee slightly bent but the body is still upright based on obviously the left foot being a little close to the ball as he steps in preparation for the skill. So we want to try and keep our hips low to the ground to help improve our balance, control, opportunity to change direction, speed, keep our body moving in the direction that we are looking to disguise or looking to accelerate and move away into. Again, player just preparing for the scissor, so player keeps the ball close, small touches, slowing down before the skill. But then again, we can see the left foot. If we're going to execute the scissor, we need to create that room and space to bring that right leg around the front of the ball from inside to out, plant our right foot on the outside. So to do that, if the ball is traveling forwards, we want to make sure that this left foot is going further out, planting in front of the ball, slightly wider so we can bend our knee, create the space to bring that right leg inside and around. And what that will do is also allow us to get lower to the ground, bend our knees, get our hips lower, get our body moving so we can disguise the skill, create space by moving the defenders and also create a foundation and a base for us to be able to push off, change direction at speed. We're looking at the player preparing to execute a scissor skill, which is a 1v1 dribbling skill. Looking at the approach, so the way the player is dribbling the ball, body position. So we want the body to be generally behind the line of the ball. We want to be dribbling with our toe down, heel up, knee slightly bent forward, making sure that we're dribbling with a low center of gravity as much as we can. So again, our hips lower, body leaning slightly further forward, head in a position closer to the line of the ball. That low center of gravity just allows us to change direction, protect the ball, and change speed more effectively. and we can see as the player is finishing off the skill the right foot plants slightly to the side of the ball, bends his knee slightly, starts to turn his body towards where he's wanting to go as he pushes the left foot so it's important as his right foot lands to the ground we bring that left foot quickly on the inside of the ball so then we can push the ball away into the space that we want to create. Again there's no genuine game situation here so the player is not really attacking the space, just more changing direction and dribbling keeping the ball close but we want to make sure at the end of this skill we're in a low body position, bend our knees, get our hips low, starting to turn in the direction we want to go next, get our chest and our body turning in the direction we want to go next and not be necessarily in this upright position because that's going to affect our ability to change direction at speed. And we can see the player preparing to do the scissor skill with the right foot, so the preparation step with the left foot is important. We can see in terms of in relation to the ball, we're stepping behind the line of the ball. So as we're considering the ball is rolling forwards, we want to try and get this left foot further forward and slightly further out away from the ball so we can bend this left knee, really disguise the skill, give ourselves space to really exaggerate the skill and create the space for ourselves. So we want to see this left knee step out a little bit wider, bend this left knee, sink our hips, get nice and low to the ground as we're executing the skills to improve our balance, our control, our speed, keep our body leaning slightly forward so we're still moving in an effective direction with the ball. So the player here just making contact with the ball for the Cruyff turn. Ideally this right leg would have a knee bend in it, making contact through the middle of the front of the ball. You can see obviously the player making contact with a straight leg. This is just because of the ball obviously rolling in the position of the left foot as he's preparing to turn. So now we're just going to lose certain elements of balance throughout the skill and the ability to really push off and change direction at maximum speed. So you can see obviously although the left knee is bent, the body is leaning back and upright as he reaches out with his straight leg. So we just want to try and make sure that we stay with our hips as close to the ball as we can, bend our knees, lower our hips, keep our body in a more centred position so as we change direction we can push off at speed. Again, we can see, again, the scissor action from the player is relatively smooth, but in terms of technical action to gain relatedness and speed, obviously elements of speed and control and balance that we can improve. So you can see as the player is doing the scissor, again, with a straight leg, I'd want to see the player with the ball a little bit closer where he can bring that left leg around the ball with a slight knee bend, which just prepares him to be able to plant that foot quicker to the ground, get his body in a better position to now push off and accelerate into the speed. The longer the stride between the plant foot and the foot doing the scissor, obviously as the ball is rolling away, it's just going to affect the next action of changing direction, changing speed. We can see the body is very upright, so the player's hips are low just because he's reaching out with that left leg a little bit. We want to try and make sure that we stay in a nice, low, centred position behind the ball using the bending of the knee, dropping the shoulder to disguise the skill, create the space. Just looking at the finishing action of the scissor. So again, the idea of any type of 1v1 skill, change of direction is to change direction quickly, to switch the point of the attack, or to separate away from the defender. So we wanna look at when we finish the skills, what's the technique with the part of the foot, and can we change speed and change direction into the space that we've created. So you can see here, the player, after he's finished the double scissor, just due to the activity to a degree, but he's in an upright position, and knees are not necessarily bent, or looking to push away into space, or he hit placement, so the player isn't gonna be able to change direction and speed. Player is looking to potentially turn around to the right, so that's obviously gonna control the position of the foot, and the part of the foot the player's looking to dribble with. i gael y chwaraewr yn gweithio'r sgiliau sgiliau, felly mae'r chwaraewr yn dangos ddifrifol technigol da, ond yn amlwg, i mi, rwy'n amlwg, rwy'n am bod yn y llaw i'r ffwrdd, nid ymwneud \u00e2'r llwybrau'n ymwneud \u00e2'r ball, felly ymdrech y gwleidyddol o ddangos y llwybrau ddrech ar y gwleidyddol o'r ball a'i rhoi ar y gwleidyddol o'r ddrech o'r ball yn dda, ond rwy'n am gweld y chwaraewr yn dda i'r ball, yn mynd gyda mwy o gyflym, drwy'r sgiliau, ymgyrchu'r llwybrau ar y gwaelod yma wrth ei ddod o gwmpas y ball, i'w parhau i'w gwneud ymdrech arall yn y sgiliau.

You see the player just executing a little Cruyff turn just to change direction so he takes his touch from his left foot towards his right before pulling the ball back. Again, any change of direction, dribbling, skill, we want to try and see the player nice and low to the ground, bend his knees, drop his hips, keep his body centred with the ball as much as he can. Here you can see the player in a relatively upright position so we want to be nice and low through these skills so as we push the ball through we can explode and accelerate and change direction onto the ball. Player just in preparation for again going into a scissor action. So as the player is obviously dribbling forwards, we want to make sure that we are slowing down in preparation for the skill, keeping the ball under control. So the player is doing a good job of keeping the ball close, manipulating the ball, changing direction. We can see his dribbling action. Again he's more redirecting the ball as he's dribbling rather than looking to dribble with speed. So ideally when we're dribbling I'd still like to see this toe pointing down, heel up. So we're making contact with the laces, with the middle of the ball, just to help us improve our speed and effectiveness of our dribbling. We see obviously the player here is in an upright body position. So as we're preparing to slow down, to change direction or to execute a skill or just dribbling in general motion, we want to try and get this dribbling foot, leg, knee over the ball, bend our knees. Obviously bend our left knee, get our hips lower to the ground, lower centre of gravity. Better balance, better control, better ball protection. When we change direction, get ourselves in a better body position to change speed. Get our chest leaning slightly forward and head in a position which is closer to the line of the ball. I like the player here is not looking at the ball, he's looking ahead. So it's important when we're dribbling we have this awareness of what's around us. Keep checking where the ball is but then dribbling with our head up so we can see the ball in our lower extremity as well as what's in front of us. Again, player dribbling, not really dribbling to attack space or speed, so more just kind of touching the ball, keeping it close, which is good, so that allows him to change direction when he wants to. But again, the foot very parallel to the ground, just kind of shuffling a little bit with it, pushing the ball more with the toe area of the foot. So although we're keeping it close, we're not dribbling in a way that's going to help us increase our speed and control. So we want to toe down, make contact with the laces through the middle of the ball to maximise our touch, our control, our running stride. Can we stay as low over the ball as we can as we're dribbling? So right knee over the ball if he's dribbling with his right foot, left knee bent, hips nice and low. Can we keep our chest leaning slightly forward so our head and our chest is in line with that ball? So as we're dribbling forward, our body momentum is moving with it. And by having that low centre of gravity helps us in terms of that change of direction, change of speed, balance, ball protection and control. ymgeisydd yn parhau i dilyn y sgwrs unig gyda sgwrs dwy.

The player just preparing to follow up the first scissor action with a double scissor. So two of the same action in a row, one with the right foot, one with the left. Again we can see as the player plants that right foot after the previous action, it's a straight leg, body upright, obviously the ball is slowing down but still moving forward so we want to try and get that plant foot in front of the ball as much as we can, keep our body leaning slightly forward and making sure if we're planting this right foot to the side of the ball that we're bending that right knee, dropping our right shoulder because we want to create space by moving the defender by using our body to disguise the skill so it gives ourselves the opportunity to push off in the opposite direction or to really manipulate the defender where we want them to go. Here the player just finishing off the technical action with the Cruyff turn. For me with the Cruyff turn, if we're in a best balanced position possible, as we make contact with the ball with the right foot, our right foot will move with the ball and push the ball out into that space. Here, because the player obviously is reaching out for the ball with a straight leg, he's more in a kind of a chopping action or a stop and a slight pushing action. What is positive here obviously is the right foot turns on the inside. You can see the player's body already turning with the ball. So the hips are turning, the chest is turning. So as the ball is moving backwards, the player's body is already moving in the correct direction to move onto the ball. You can see the player nice and light with his feet. This left leg being bent brings his hips a little bit lower to the ground and his body is starting to move and lean in the direction he wants to go next. Prior to executing the 1v1 skill, the scissor skill, we want to look at the approach and the preparation. So that would be if we're going to do the scissor with the right foot, then we want to step to the side of the ball with the left foot. And as this left foot steps to the side of the ball, we obviously want to figure out where the direction of the ball is traveling. So the ball is traveling forwards. So if we step either level or behind the ball, the ball is going to be obviously in front of us as we perform the skill. So we want to try and step out to the side of the ball and in front of the ball. So as the ball rolls, the ball is not traveling too far away from us. Make sure that we are bending this left knee so that then drops the left shoulder. Because in the game situation, we want to make the defender think that we're going one way. So we're going to step, use the balls of our feet, bend our knee, get our hips forward, get our body leaning slightly forward. So here you see the players in an upright position, so it's going to make it less effective and efficient to disguise the skill and perform the skill. The player now prepares to do a scissor action with the right leg. The scissor is bringing the right leg around the inside of the ball, around the front of the ball and then landing his right foot to the outside of the ball. Just to disguise the skill and make the defender go one way. To do that we want to make sure that the ball is travelling in a forward direction. So if the ball is rolling forwards we want to plant our left foot accordingly. So we want to try and plant that left foot in front of the current position of the ball, slightly further to the side so we have space to bring that right leg in and around. By getting that left leg further away from the ball will allow us to get into a lower body position, protect the ball, change direction, bend our knees etc. So it's important we get that left foot in the right position. We can see as the player plants his left foot it's a straight leg, upright body position. So although the player is slowing down, we don't want to slow down to a point where we're leaning back and upright. That's going to affect our ability to both protect the ball and change direction at speed.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She's, I mean, she's actually aiming. So if this was a free throw, this is really good. I still would get our feet apart. Let's get this left hand on the side. In fact, if she's a right-handed shooter, you see that left hand coming around the ball. Again, she kind of steps and almost crosses one foot over the other, locks those knees out. Let's bend our knees, let's drop our hips, let's get our feet apart, and let's get one of these hands out of the shot. Because it just, you know, we call it shooting touch. Here, when that ball hits the rim, it just hits it really hard and it doesn't really give it a chance to go in. Again, I'd love to eventually, as she becomes more skilled, you know, just step back and step into this pass so you can get some lift. She's learning. I love how she had her arms out and hands ready to catch the basketball. Nice job there. Here's the release. Again, you know, I really can't tell if she's right or left handed. I really want to say she's right-handed, but the left arm is too much in the shot. But you see a little bit of snapping of the wrist there, which is good. Good. She's up on the balls of her feet. However, the feet are very close together. Let's get them apart. And then on her landing, look how the feet are almost crossed. She's, you know, not in a really balanced position here. So basically, let's, you know, bend our knees, have a staggered cushion landing, and when also let's hold this follow through. Both arms end up coming down. Again, you know, she's got her feet really close together and you see instead of like jumping and lifting and stepping in this pass, she just kind of dips down. But even as she bends her knees, that's really good she's bending her knees. Here it looks like the elbow, shooting elbow is under the ball, which is good. And you can see how she just takes that little extra step there and locks those knees out. I mean the ball hasn't hit the rim yet. Let's land softly, bend our knees, feet apart, and let's keep our follow through up. Here, again, bending of the knees, feet need to be one in front of the other, staggered stance, and let's get those elbows in. Again, kind of just steps forward with, and I really can't even tell which foot, looks like our left foot. But again, she kind of ends up like kind of straight up or kind of locked out her knees. Let's absorb this landing, whether you go up on your balls or your feet, you want to come down soft with light pressure. Let's hold our follow-through up, but good arc on the ball as it makes its way to the basket. Again, good lift and elevation here with an extension of the body to lift. And I love that she's got some follow through, but let's get that left hand guide hand out of the shot. It looks really good right there as it leaves her hand. Again, shot with two hands, feet are kind of close together, one falls in front of the other, and here you don't see a follow through at all. So again, you want to follow through until that ball hits the rim, or goes through the net. Again, kind of straight up with the legs, feet are really close together. But here, the best I could see, that shooting hand does look like it's behind the ball. The guide hand's starting to move to the side. But again, that's all, you just want that offhand to just have some token light pressure here. It just helps lift it up for your shot. Does it shoot the ball? No, the guide hand does not shoot the basketball, but it helps support it and give it balance. It helps guide it up to your shot. Here the shooter is shooting a 15-footer. The first thing I would say about this is her feet are really, really close together. Ideally, you want your feet to be one foot in front of the other. If you're a right-hand shooter, the right foot should be slightly in front. I can't tell you how far. It's so that you have a good base, good balance, good stability there. before you shoot and after. Her knees are kind of locked out. And it looks like she's kind of got two hands on the ball. She does have her eye on her target, I can tell. So, nice job there. Again, let's spread our feet, good bending of the knees there. Let's get this guide hand, this left hand. I believe she's a right-handed shooter. Let's get that guide hand, left hand on the side. Good eyes on target here. Again, steps kind of forward or falls forward. Again, you see the shooting with both hands. Then you're the ball's just not getting that backspin, the rotation that you're looking for. Again, good knee bend. She goes to bend her knees. Let's get our feet apart from one another. Again, we kind of fall forward with our feet. We drop our follow-through. Let's hold it up there. But she's got pretty good arc on the ball. That ball's probably going back and forth, back and forth, hits the rim, pops out. Again, good lift here, good verticality, but again, she's released the ball. I can't even really tell if she's a right-hander or left-hand shooter. Again, let's designate one hand and get that guide hand, the off hand on the side. And you can see here the use of both hands to shoot the ball. And you can, and it's confirmed in this ego view, which is a great look, you can tell she's shooting with two hands. I mean, both arms are extended, you know, both wrists are breaking. It just throws off the accuracy of the shot. Doesn't look as good. I mean, it's not getting that little backspin rotation that you would want to see. And you could see it here. And she does take a big step with that. It looks like her left foot in this picture. So she's, you know, just a little off balance. I would, you know, she would benefit from moving again in close, designating a shooting hand and just working on that, those mechanics. And sometimes when you shoot 15 feet or more, you kind of revert back to mechanics that maybe aren't in line with what they should be. So sometimes moving in closer, tighter can help offset that.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She also maintains a lot of choreographic clarity in her arms as well as in her feet, keeping a nice soft bend in the knees and being grounded in her movement overall. As the dancer begins with this more advanced salsa choreography here, which appears to be either choreographic or perhaps an improvised step, she really demonstrates that she has a more advanced understanding of the movement technique. She incorporates her arms in a way that's choreographically clear and appropriate, maintains a nice rhythmic embodiment in her shoulders, through her upper body, and through her pelvis, and has a lot of clarity in her footwork. She's also got a nice soft bend in her knees, which is helping to keep her grounded. As the dancer transitions into a box step, which then jumps out into a lunging shape, she struggles in this transition here. You can see she kind of just resorts to a very pedestrian stance with her arms kind of loosely bent at her sides. She loses all the groundedness that she had in her knees and her pelvis before, and overall just struggles to transition here. Perhaps she just needs some additional rehearsal to remember the choreography, or just in general to find some clarity in this transition. As the dancer transitions into a salsa step that moves her forwards and backwards in the space, she continues to demonstrate her advanced understanding of the movement vocabulary, transitioning her arms in meaningful ways that appear choreographically appropriate as well as rhythmically embodied. She also maintains a lot of clarity in her footwork, maintains a nice soft bend in her knees, as well as movement through her pelvis and upper body. As the dancer transitions from the perhaps improvised or freestyle movements that she had before, she really struggles to keep a solid transition from those movement phrases into the next. Here she kind of maintains a pedestrian stance, she goes in and out of dance movement, and overall would just benefit from finding a little more clarity in this transition.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

In this one, he brings the left foot that was extended on a flag to come into a high foot placement, this one at the bar where he started as the start hold. He continues to apply pressure onto that right foot that is extended, pushing against the hole until he gets to secure the left foot placement. The climber is able to bring his left hand over to the next move, this one being a vertical pinch hold. So once the climber gets to squeeze onto the hold, then he can drop the weight by extending the arm and leaning back. In doing so, the climber had gone up for that first move with the right leg extended, which was on a flag, and now he has picked up the right foot to bring it over to a match. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet, especially when making a foot placement or a foot switch. The climber places the right toe to come into contact with the foot hold, and once the climber applies sufficient pressure, then he will be able to release the left foot from its place. It was smart of the climber to send his right hand to cross over the left hand. This because it places him directly to have the grips in front of him and only had to twist the wrist in order to replace the left hand. Now the climber is underneath the hold and it's placing the fingertips on the other side of the edge by pressing with the thumbs creating almost like a chin-up position to sustain the grip. The climber was able to make the left hand up for the next hold. This one being a large lip where the climber can wrap the fingers behind the hold, this is called a jug or more like this is a long edge would be a bucket. So the climber needs to release some of the pressure at the hand to move it along to bump it over to the left side. So the climber pulls up harder in order to release some of the pressure at the hands by picking up the feet also to give momentum onto the jump for the climber in order to release some of the pressure at the hand to move it along the edge. The climber here was struggling to make the right foot placement so he engages in a very forceful pull up onto that sloper and presses down on the left foot in order to send the left hand out for the next hold. As we can see as the climber was committing into that push he lost the left foot placement so right now the climber has no contact down at the feet. This is called cutting feet and and the hope is that the climber gets to land the hand at the edge of that hold on the next move. This is a very positive hold being a jug because the climber will be able to wrap the fingers around the edge of the hold. The climber is starting at a one-hold start. He places both of the hands on the same hold. This is called matching. And he places both of the hands in the same motion, where he places the fingers above and the thumb at the bottom. That thumb will help the climber to generate power on the grip. And this is called a pinch grip, as the climber will be squeezing onto the hold to create pressure. Once the climber secures the grip, he will be able to lean back, weighing the grips. And the climber is doing a step-up start. So once the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing in the mat, then the climb will start. Since the climber was able to secure the left toe hooking onto the hold, he was able to bring up the right leg to bring it over to a match at the edge of the hold. Now this was easy because the climber had already dropped the weight by having the legs extended and now both of the legs are extended having more force for the climber to sustain the toe hook with both of them engaged. This is called a bat hang so the climber must continue to apply pressure at the feet by dropping the toe downwards. As we can see the climber was able to release the right hand and brings it over to a match at the jug. The climber chooses to release the right foot from its place by dropping the leg. This to help the climber to drop the weight over to the left toe being in place inside the hold. The climbers next hold is a rounded hold. This one has some small grooves into it. So the climber is able to place the fingertips onto those dented areas of the rounded hold. This is technically a sloper because there is no lip or edge for him to hold on to. So having contact of the skin towards the hold is necessary to create friction. We can see the climber creating this meat hooking, it's called, where he needs to maximize skin contact to surface the hold. So he will be pressing the wrist into the hold to secure the grip. The climber was able to send the right hand up for the reach. In order to do that he has extended the left leg. This is called flagging out and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. He brings the knee to come inwards so that he is able to keep his right side towards the wall to bring his center of gravity towards the wall. This is to keep in balance his move while doing the extension. For the right hand, the climber is placing it over a lobe and is able to bring the hand placement as a pinch hold as he is able to wrap the thumb onto the other side of the hold. This one is rounded so it is important that the climber creates friction between the skin and the hold and lays low in order to transfer over the weight to the grip. The climber was able to press over on the left foot. This one being a large hold, the climber pushes the hold in order to bring his hips over to a rise. Now the climber is close to the wall and the right leg is extended with no contact against the wall on the right foot. This is called flagging so it helps the climber to transfer the weight to the highest foot being in place.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He does give the tea a stir here so that the milk doesn't burn on the bottom of the pan and also to get the sugar to dissolve into the tea milk. And you can audibly hear it start to sizzle. This is when he decides to cut the milk down to medium. Here he strains his tea mixture through a fine mesh sieve into his serving cup. This is an expert level task in creating a milk tea. It's very difficult to pour a hot liquid through a very small sieve into a very small cup and he does this task with ease. Again, as it gets very hot on the bottom of the milk tea, you can hear that when he stirs it, it almost has a scraping sound. That is the milk scalding on the bottom of the pan. He appears to add one tablespoon of black tea leaves. That is an appropriate amount. You could do one to two tablespoons, depending on your preference of how much tea flavor you want in your milk tea. Now with the liquid inside the pan, he can light it over medium heat. But then he pauses and realizes he shouldn't light an empty pan without having his liquid inside the pan. He adjusts his temperature of his liquid to high so that he can get it to boil. You could leave it at medium here or you could bring it to high if you want your milk tea to steep quicker. Next, he adds his black tea leaves. This step could be added before the sugar or after the sugar. They are interchangeable steps to creating this task. Tea should steep for typically three to five minutes in order to extract all of the flavor. Again, that's a personal preference, but it looks like here he is steeping the tea for about three minutes before he completes the task. He does seem to have a very good sense of how to manipulate the heat up and down in order to A. get his tea to steep efficiently and quickly and B. not have the mixture boil over So that's an expert level kind of home cook knowledge of how heat works in boiling liquid. He adds what appears to be two teaspoons to his one cup liquid measure. The sweetness of your milk tea is always a personal preference, but this is an appropriate amount of sweetener. Even as he stirs, you can hear the milk is getting very hot and the tea leaves are obviously steeping into the milk. As you can see that the color has changed here from a creamy white to almost a beige color, which means that it's close to being completed. The first step in making a milk tea is to grab all of the essential tools and ingredients that you will need. It would be beneficial at this time for him to cut this heat down from high to medium high or medium So that he could let the tea the tea steep for longer without the milk Boiling over When you are heating a liquid over high, especially a milk product like this, it's appropriate to stir it occasionally as you see it come to a boil, because if you didn't do that, otherwise the milk would boil over very quickly and create a mess. Next, he adds his sugar, which is the sweetener for this milk tea. You could use any sugar alternative such as honey, maple syrup, simple syrup, brown sugar, or stevia for a sugar-free alternative. Here you'll notice as he cuts down the heat again, he's really playing with the temperature here. He cuts it down, stirs it, cuts it back up, and you can see here that the milk is almost boiling over. In this instance, he probably should grab his handles and remove the pot from the heat altogether, just so that it can come down in the pot and not be about to boil over. He adds his pre-measured milk here. It looks to be about one cup of liquid measure. Here you can see that he is reaching for his lighter to then light the pot which is empty.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

You can tell in their bow hold that there's a lot of fluidity that's helping them get from string to string. The palace is playing with a very pronated bow hold, which is helping them get the amount of sound that they're getting at the tip of the bow. The violinist is vibrating with this finger. To get their vibrato to come through a little bit more, they can focus on having a little bit more width and more flexibility in the finger. The vinyl is picking a really great spot in the bow to play this bowing. They're able to have good strong downbows, but also get back with the upbow so it sounds a little bit more balanced. The violinist's string crossings can be smoother. As they're playing on their current string, they can start to gradually bring down the bow towards the next string so that whenever they change to a different string, it's not so much of a sudden movement. The final set is the bow on the string. This is the best way to start the sound to have a more coordinated approach. The violinist also does a really excellent job bringing in their upper arm to help them play exactly at the frog. This is allowing them to make sure that they can use their whole bow, which is really maximizing their sound. The violins are using a lot of speed and weight here to have this really impassioned sound. This is allowing them to have a deeper sound from the violin. The violinist's sound could be a little bit more open. They could have a little bit less weight and a little bit more speed. Just make sure that the string is vibrating more to get more of this ringing sound.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The Buells is doing a good job with this bow stroke. They're keeping it very close to the string. If they wanted a little bit more power, they could add a little bit more horizontalness to it so they're adding more bow. The Buells have some really efficient movement here whenever they're crossing strings. They're using minimal amount of bow to get over to the string crossing. They're also keeping the bow very close to the string so there's not any extra movement that is making it harder for them to coordinate. The stroke that the violist has is also very nice. They're keeping the bow very close to the string, and they have a nice bounce in the stick, which is allowing them to get the articulation that they want. The ULSS is doing a bunch of up bowings, going up, up, up. I feel like they should just do it as it comes down, up, down, just so it comes across more clearly. They were able to get a better sound that way. As the passage speeds up, the vules do a good job of keeping the bow very close to the string the whole time. Again, this is a section where their fingers are starting to come off the string a little bit too high, and now that they're playing faster, it's more difficult for them to keep up this tempo and to get the clarity that they need. They should try to keep their fingers as close as possible to the fingerboard. This stroke that they have, they're staying on the string, which really helps with clarity and consistency. They're also bouncing the stick as they're playing this, which is giving them that articulation that they're looking for. The viola is playing with a very straight bow, which is resulting in a very sustained and clean sound. To get full bows, the veal is utilizing their upper arm to help them get back to the frog. The violas is playing further out in the bow and using a lighter amount of weight to create this thinner sound. They could commit even more and try to play a little bit further up and use more bow speed for this character. While playing these moving notes now, the violist is using a really perfect amount of bow to help give them a little bit of length to each note, but not too much that it's hard to coordinate with the left hand playing at this tempo. The Buelles tier has a really nice stroke. They're starting from the string, which is really important for coordination and getting a very clean sound consistently. With these 16ths that they're playing, they can have a little bit more of this scrubbing motion where they get into the string a little bit more so that it's louder and comes across in the music. The violist is using a down bow ricochet. They should try to play with more flat hair so they have more of a surface to bounce off of. The first one they should just imagine like they're relaxing, then the bow will do the rest of the work. The Buells is using their first finger to pluck the string. This last chord could be worked on for intonation. The stroke for this section that the violist is using is a little bit light. They could try to pronate a little bit more, maybe even get a little bit closer to the frog, maybe even just a little bit further down to get a little bit more articulation, so there's more front to every single note. The violist is having a hard time with their left hand in this section. They should just try to play this very slowly so they know exactly where their notes are going. The violaist is now using full bows playing this melody, resulting in a very healthy sound. This chord that they're playing could be improved with frontination. They should try to play one finger at a time, usually the lower note first, and then adding the top note to that. The Buells does a really nice job with this last ricochet bowing, that they just let the stick naturally do its thing. The VLSI uses a harmonic here. If they wanted to be a little bit clearer, they could play with more flat hair and getting a little bit closer to the bridge for the harmonic. The violist is playing a legato note. They're using a very smooth bow to get a sustained sound. The violist is playing this passage in a great part of the bow. They're able to get some leverage from their arm for a lot of the string crossings, but they're not too far out into the tip where they're losing a lot of weight that sacrifices the sound. The violist uses their first finger to pluck the strings very quickly. When coming off this down bow, the fuelist removes the bow from the string. They should try to keep it on the string as much as possible so then this next note that they have will be much more clear. The Vuls is using a lot less bow and a lot less weight to create a lighter dynamic with these notes. The violist is using full bows in this section to get a very healthy, clean sound. The violist is using a full amount of bow and a good amount of weight to create this powerful sound. The puelist very frequently has flying fingers in their left hand. Whenever they have a higher finger pressed down on the string, the rest of the finger should also be down. This would overall lead to being a more efficient left hand. This is a section that when they were playing faster, the coordination got a little bit out of control. I believe this is because of the coordination with their hands. Their fingers keep flying up, so it's harder for them to coordinate and play like that long term. The violist is pronating with their right hand so that they're getting a lot of weight into the stick. This is allowing them to get a lot of power on an up bow when they're playing up at the tip. Again, this is a section where the violist has their fingers flying up as they're playing. Especially if you're playing this fast, it would be more clear if they kept their fingers closer to the fingerboard.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The kicks and the claps shouldn't be happening at the same time. Should be kick, back step, and clap. But she's kind of doing the clap and the kicks all and the steps all combined simultaneously. So she really needs to be isolating these steps in sequence when she's going back rather than doing them all together at the same time. The dancer just circled her arms downward but she didn't really finish the circle. It would be nice if she finished the circle completely so that her arms made a full revolution but she kind of cut this movement short because she's anticipating her next step. So my advice would be to finish a step fully instead of cutting it in favor of starting the next one. It will still be sequential but finish your last step before you start your next one. The dancer is sometimes focusing her eyes outward to the direction that her foot is going and sometimes focusing her eyes forward. She's capable of doing both, but what would help her here is if she did one consistently. So whether she's clearly focusing straight word or clearly focusing outward in the direction would be wonderful just to show that she is able to maintain that. When she just threw her arms out and up, kind of in a V shape, each arm was pointing to a diagonal. Her arms were good, but she could finish the line more with her hands if her hands had energy in them. Her arms had energy, but her hands were kind of not as energized. So she extends that energy from her shoulder all the way out to her fingertips. That would improve the step. She had really good control of her arms, circling them up and around, and then circling them around and back up. She kind of alternated, and she did this in perfect rhythm because she took eight counts to do it, but in the first direction, she took four counts, and in the direction coming back, she also took four counts. So they were equal, neither was favored more, and her rhythm was clear, steady on time. The dancer just bent down very low when she was moving to her right. She didn't only, oh sorry, that's to her left. When she was moving to her left, she didn't only move to her left, but she moved to her left and also moved downward at the same time. So she's combining directional pulls and this is wonderful. She's doing this purposefully, swiftly and easily. The dancer just added in a stylistic flare as she bent lower, her upper body lower when she moved her foot forward as well. This was a clear choice that she made and shows full control of her body. The dancer is getting very low here. She's able to do this because her heel is off the ground, which is allowing her to squat further and not straining her Achilles tendon. This is great. She's able to shift her weight because of basically how her feet are placed. However, here she did not shift her weight completely and we can see that her weight isn't centered and it's not pushed to her left. We could tell that because over here her right foot is down on the floor instead of her toes being up and pressed into her heel as she was in the last time she did this step. Her legs here are not as crossed as it could be. So here her left leg could really cross further more in front and her right leg could cross further more in back to execute this motion to show that she's in a clear shape and not in this in-between place. The dancer started out this routine with a lot of energy, however she has lost it a bit in terms of she has lowered her energy throughout so that this part later on in the routine does not match where she began at the start. My commentary would be to start and end with the same amount of energy to not have a decrescendo or a decreasing of energy throughout. You want to end as strong as you began. And as I mentioned before, she loses her rhythm in this step. So her arms and her leg when she's kicking and when she's clapping should not occur at the same time. They should occur at different times. So if she's ever kicking and clapping at the same time for this particular step that she's attempting to execute, she isn't coordinated the way in which the step requires. So to make her movement more efficient or more correct, she has to separate the movements between her lower body and her upper body or her leg and her hand to not be simultaneous. Her heel here was pressed into the floor and her toes are pointing up. This was really good. It showed that she changed her weight shift to her right side of her body. And we can really see that because her heel was up. So basically her weight was predominantly on her right leg. That's great. The dancer is changing direction often. She's facing all different types of directions in the room. This is wonderful for dance to be able to use every direction because dance is a 3D art. But in doing so, she needs to make sure that she's aware of where or which direction she's going when so that it's not a coincidence. And she can make her movement more crisp or more efficient by fully facing that direction. So having her shoulders, having her hips, having her head face that direction or face different directions on each other would be fine as long as it's purposeful and clear. She's kind of going back and forth between directions without entirely ever arriving at one before she hits the next one. The dancer is doing a lovely job of being lively here. She is keeping her energy upbeat as well as swinging her arms back and forth so her body movements and energy match the music. The dancer might have ran out of space here because of the way the camera is set up, but even if she is to run out of space, each of her steps, even if stationary, should be large. So in order to use the space that she has efficiently, she could have picked her knees up higher to make this step look more energized instead of kind of just an in-place step waiting on to stay in the screen or in the camera setup. So to find a different way to use her energy without stopping, one option could be to have lifted her knees on those steps. This Shorty George step, the step where she's swiveling her feet and moving forward, she's doing very well because her feet are close together. This is essential for this step. It'd be much more difficult for her to cover ground like that if her legs were instead further apart. It wouldn't be easy for her to travel forward as she is, but because her legs are together, she's able to do this with ease. When she is moving her arms upward like this, she is keeping her shoulders aligned. Her shoulders aren't going above her neck. She is not slouching. She is raising her arms well. They're extended, but her shoulders remain down when she's raising her arms. This is great. In this clap step, her arms are not organized. They're flapping a bit, but she can correct this step if she remains doing the same step, but putting extra attention and emphasis in her arms so that the clap is a clear clap and not just a consequence of her kicking her leg. The dancer is matching the intonations of the music. She moved backwards quickly when there was a lot of instruments in the music, and then she slowed down her movement going forward and backwards to align with the sounds that the music was making. This was great and demonstrated wonderful musicality. This is a much better execution of this step. Her legs are in a clear X. Here, her right leg is in front, her left leg is in back. She's using different directions here with her legs. This is clear. This is a wonderful execution of this step. And she even throws in some style points by bending her body lower. So her body's reaching towards the ground while her legs are reaching on both diagonals. The dancer is executing the Charleston step great, basically perfectly, because her ankles are rotating medially and laterally, both in and outwardly, as she moves them forward and backwards. This is an essential detail in this step, and she's doing it with ease.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The turn is much faster and sharper as she turns around. When she turns to her left, it's a little bit slower, so she can definitely try to pick up that turn as she goes to the left, just to kind of snap it around as much as she does on the right side. Here she crosses in front, she rotates her body just slightly to the corner which is nice. She's not using too much space so she could definitely step out a little bit further but she keeps it really together and still keeping the same rotation in her arms as well as a nice simple movement in her hips. So the dancer starts with a really nice energy and flow in her body. She is stepping in place and her feet are nice and light. Right here you see that her right foot, the heel, is off the floor as it should be. Her knees are bent as she steps and she has a really nice rotation in her arms and her upper body. Here she steps forward and back again same rhythm in her upper body, nice gentleness in her knees and then stepping lightly on her feet. So here she steps out. She could go up on her toe for this foot as she steps out to the side, but she has a really nice movement and sway in her hips. They are still rocking side to side as she steps out and again keeping a nice rotation in her arms.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So, his arm is to the right of the ball on the release with his elbow being out, his feet being perfectly aligned next to each other so that forces his elbow to be pointed outwards. This is a perfect recipe for a shooter to continuously miss the ball to the right side of the basket, which he does on this shot. As he releases the ball, you take a look. You can see on the shooting hand, the last two fingers that are on the ball are his index finger and also his middle finger. So with these two fingers being the last two fingers to leave the ball, that's going to create good backspin. So that means his hand placement and the release on his shooting hand are really good because those two fingers are the last two fingers to touch the ball. However, because of his feet being perfectly square like this, you can see here his elbow is still out. So with his elbow being out, that means that it's hard for us on that follow-through for the ball to be completely straight in the direction that we want it to go. Just making a slight adjustment of his feet will guarantee that the ball is going to go straight every single time. This shot right here was actually his best shot. As you can see, as he releases the ball, you see his guy hand is open towards the basket here. Like on this plane. Excuse my bad drawing. So you see a straight line here and then you see his left hand, the shooting hand, is here. So his guy hand and his left hand are separated and they're not, it didn't cross the plane on the release of the ball. And so the ball is going to go straight right down where we wanted the ball to go, straight towards the basket. This was his best shot, although it didn't go in. This was his best release and his best shot. It just went in and out. This was a good shot. This is what is known as a good miss, even though he missed the shot, the follow through and the release of the ball was really, really good. He still has things he needs to clean up with his feet as far as having the proper spacing and having his left foot in front. But this release right here was his best release. on this shot he was able to fight the urge for the ball, for his arm to come out so much to the right side. It's still going a little bit to the right but it's not nearly as much as it was on the previous shots and because of that this shot because his arm didn't go so far to the right the ball on the release was more straight. Now the issue with this particular shot was he shot it too strong so he put too much power into it so although it was straight it hit the backboard too hard and we missed the shot. Taking a look at his footwork, his feet are perfectly lined up next to each other. Because of this, his left elbow, which is his shooting hand, is pointing at a slant, which means his left elbow is pointing out and away from the basket. As a left-handed shooter, you want your left foot to be slightly in front of the right foot. So now if his right foot is slightly in front, this will change the angle of his arm to this, to more of a straight down effect, and his elbow is more in line with the basket. So we want to make sure that the placement of our feet are correct. Also if you take a look at his feet, his feet are so close together, as he bends down, his knees are over his toes. This lets you know that his feet are too close together, because as he bends down for this motion, his knees shouldn't be crossed over his toes. His knees shouldn't be over his toes if he draws a straight line down like that. So he needs to spread his legs, have his feet a little bit wider apart, so when he bends down his knees do not go over his toes. So when he bends down, his knees should actually be behind his toes instead of over the front of his toes, like it is on this shot attempt. Again, releases the ball. His arm is at this trajectory going to the right. The ball again is going to miss to the right side of the basket. You see here after the release of the ball as he holds up his follow-through, you can see his left arm, his shooting arm, has crossed the plane and is actually on the right side of the ball after the release. So he releases the ball and he's moving the ball, moving his arm as he releases it to the right side of the basket. So with this action with his arm, he's creating momentum high over slight that as the ball is traveling towards the basket, excuse me, as the ball is traveling towards the basket here, it is actually slightly moving to the right because of this action of his arm as he releases it, the arm is moving to the right. So the momentum is actually pushing the ball to the right. So his elbow being out and moving his shooting arm across his body to the right side means that more often than not, he has the tendency of missing to the right side of the basket on his shot. We take a look at his hand placement on the ball. He actually has really good hand placement. As you can see, the left index finger, which is his shooting hand, is right there in the middle of the ball. So this is good placement of his left hand on the ball. And his right hand, which is his guy hand, is on the side of the ball. So he has really good hand placement as he goes into this shot.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Let me see him kind of swap positions, get nice and opposite pose. He's got a left hand on, right foot on. This left foot kind of smears into the wall. He's kind of doing almost a twist lock technique, so he's kind of going to twist into this arm. He's not doing it fully, but he's setting up like it. So this should let him do is get his weight over that right foot, twist in, get that right hip into the wall, and be able to extend off that hip and drive himself up the wall. So you can see he's starting, he's kind of keeping his arms nice and tensioned but straight. He's kind of really sinking into these feet. And one interesting thing is he's starting with this kind of heel hook on his left. So he's going to kind of post with the right and heel hook with the left. It's probably because maybe the more positive side of the hold is facing that direction. And then on his way back in he kind of lets go and then just falls off the wall. So it's hard to say what happened here, but I think by pausing and taking time to better establish and set up for the jump, it could be pretty beneficial kind of taking that jump to the legs instead of the arms. And it seems like he kind of just goes to the dyno. It seems like he might have been able to kind of sink back in. It seems like most of the effort for the dyno was in his arms. He didn't really drive with his feet. He does hit the hole and he hits it pretty square on. It looks like he's got a good grip, but for whatever reason, he's just not able to hold it. That heel hook, what it does is kind of lets him pull over with that left foot. So he has to do less with his arms. And he can kind of create that tension with his leg to kind of pull himself to the left.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The omelet will still cook and be done. This cook seems to be moving through this quote-unquote recipe quite easily With ease she knows where everything is she's already like Measing, plossing all her stuff out, heating up the pan or preheating the pan which is a good thing. I'm impressed I like how she added a little bit more oil to the pan. That's a very good thing. Sometimes you don't put enough, so it's okay just to add a little bit more.

And they're also able to stay on the music, being very clear of is it jump two feet and out, or is it a swing through, stand up, swing through, stand up with both, when they swing through both feet being further apart from each other. Creating that clarity as they swing their arms of what the movement should be will also create movement visually for the audience. The dancer is doing quite a lovely job of swinging their arms side to side while they move in this circular motion on the floor. The one thing that I would say to improve this movement to add a little pizzazz or just the extra oomph that would help the person trying to learn this or to help the dancer be intentional about where they're going in the direction is one little detail is what is the arm supposed to be doing from well what is the hand supposed to be doing from the wrist all the way up to the fingertips is their hand spread apart and their hand is flexed or is their hand supposed to be relaxed or is it supposed to be in a fist all these small little details just add another layer of attention to the choreography that's important and I highlight this one because the hands are in very important indicators of whether they're they're supposed to be tension in the hands or whether the body looks the whole body looks relaxed and this dancer at this moment kind of switches what they do at the hands at different points in this phrase work For these swivels, the dancers are doing a great job of showing that their knees are twisting in and out. I would just be more clear to improve this movement of are their feet together and their knees together when they're twisting? Or is it supposed to be one knee twists to one direction at the time and the second knee follows? At times they twist together with both knees facing the same direction. And then sometimes they twist with one knee is going one direction and then the second leg is kind of following behind at a slower pace. So being more intentional about that would create more clarity for this basic choreography of how to perform the movement. Also, because it is more of a swing step, really, and they're pointing their fingers down, being very intentional about over accentuating or isolating those shoulders, moving it forward and back and forward and back. The dancer does a lovely job of showing us these toe heels, which there's actually standing on the whole ball of their foot, not the actual toe. I just wanted to highlight that. They're on the ball of their foot and then going down to their heel. So we call it toe heels, but it's actually like ball, heel drop, ball, heel drop. And they're also, their weight is back and they're sitting back in their hips and their knees are bent, which creates that sound, right? So in tap dance, we always say, if you're not bending your legs, you're not creating sound. It's very hard to create sound standing up straight. So the dancer does a great job of showing these ball heels or what we normally call toe heels, but they're really ball of the foot heel drops. The dancer does a great job of keeping flow, but sometimes I question the rhythm. So to improve this movement, I'll be very clear on what beats they're supposed to be making. Or another way that I can say this is what beat is their body making versus what is the beat of the music? Because the body can become an instrument in choreography that makes different sounds. So it sounds like there's this melody in the music that's happening and then the body is supposed to be beats, but I'm not really sure. So just being very clear about rhythm and beat in this one specific section. The dancer does a great job of showing how to bring the foot out and in for these tap togethers to improve this movement. I would be very clear about the articulation of the feet, which is critical in tap dance. So are they striking the whole foot, which is a stamp or stomp, or are they tapping just the ball of the foot? So they might want to show them with their heel lifted and just the ball of the foot tapping together and tapping together and then doing that double. This is a lovely example of again an undercurve and I just want to highlight that pendulum swing as they move going up and down across the floor. And they keep this really nice undercurve as they travel which is very difficult to do and it's happening pretty nicely. Here, the dancer is doing a great job of staying on rhythm and demonstrating musicality. However, to improve this movement, I would encourage them to follow my previous comment about being overly dramatic with the shoulders to accentuate the movement, as well as being very clear on the articulation of the foot. Is it the whole foot? Is it the ball of the foot? Is it the heel of the foot that creates different rhythms and different sounds within the music that are super important for this type of movement? The dancer is doing a wonderful job at these step taps. You can see the pendulum swing or the hips swing in their hips. And then you can also see their knees are bent and their hips are pushed a little bit back to create a greater range of motion and their arms are flowing with them as they do these step togethers. To improve this movement, I would actually take the head with them while they are swinging side to side to just show the difference of where the directionality of the movement.

So again, well-rounded, very skilled. As the video comes to an end, we see there were two consecutive sequences of touches, which is a very decent amount, meaning the ball was just dropped one time in nearly two and a half minutes. This second sequence was 76 plus touches. First sequence was about 130 plus touches. So again, high proficiency here, very impressive mixture of different surfaces, different weights, and most importantly, keeping the ball in the air for long periods of time. After over 130 consecutive touches we have our first ball drop, also after 90 seconds. An impressive inside to inside to outside combination here thrown in by the player. Just again to touch on variety of surfaces of the body being used here We've just seen some good alternating quad touches shown against some well-rounded proficiency here in juggling the ball As we can see, the ball has come from a height, but those previous couple of touches have been about hip height consistently, so it's a good save from the player and again, good control on the juggles. Three outside of the foot touches linked together in a row. Again, not easy. some consistently low height and low weight touches made look easy by the player here in this sequence again just showing that higher proficiency being able to make not an easy skill look pretty easy and in a casual manner here again suggesting that this player is towards the higher end of the scale here Another impressive touch here, so as we highlight in the last one, a high ball came down, it was taken on the chest. There was one touch after the chest touch and then this one was the follow-up touch, which continued to keep the ball in the air and to keep the touch sequence increasing. So again, high proficiency shown here, very impressive skills from this juggler. In this video we are going to be looking at juggling or as named in other countries Volleying so juggles or volleys some of the criteria that I'm going to be judging this will be The number of juggles in a row and the touch chains So are we seeing many touches many juggles in a row without the ball being dropped? The number of times the ball is dropped overall in the video will have an indication as well On the proficiency from there the variety of the parts of the feet and the body that are used to keep the ball in the air, so Is the player just using one part of one foot because that's what they're strongest with or are they using Many different parts of both feet are using their quads Are they taking some touches maybe on a chest or the head to keep the ball from touching the floor? So that would be some of the stuff that we will be looking at to The height of the juggles or the touches Are they consistent or are they going higher and higher and having a negative knock-on effect? Where it's causing the ball now to be losing control and dropping onto the floor consistently We'll be looking at the readjustment of the feet and the stance of the player that is juggling the ball. So are they readjusting that standing foot before they take a juggle or are they staying planted and allowing themselves to be off balance which is going to have a negative knock-on effect to the amount of juggles that they do and the amount of touches they can kind of string together to keep the ball in the air and Then lastly just the consistent weight of the touch. So is there a consistency? And is there a well controlled weight on the touches to keep the ball from not going too high and to keep it controllable? So we will try to mention and point out some of these things Throughout the video and that will hopefully then lead us to our proficiency score towards the end So just about two minutes in, we've still just had only one drop within our second sequence, our combination of touches here, and we can still see the players comfortable alternating the sides and switching up the different parts of the feet, so the insides, the outsides, also the use of the quads to readjust the weight of the touches to take some momentum out of the ball where needed or to add momentum in also where needed, and the players again show an impressive mixture of weight, height and surfaces used. Being over a minute into the video here, there still has been no drop of the ball. The ball has not touched the floor since the start of the sequence. The player is readjusting his stance well, and the consistency of the touch weight is improving as the ball is staying consistently lower, which is obviously helping the player to achieve a high amount of touches in a row. So here we're seeing some good chest control. So we're taking the ball here on the chest from a very high ball somewhere up around this height or higher. For that to come down from such a height and to be controlled on the chest is not a very easy technique. So again towards the higher side of the proficiency scale with this touch. We are seeing some good alternating feet sequences with variety of parts of the foot being used. As we can see here, the outside of the foot is being used, the knee is going inwards, a little twist in the hip, the foot is coming towards the outside and twisting out from the knee out here. And the outside of the foot is connecting with the bottom of the ball to bring it up in the air. This is not an easy technique at all, especially one to follow up from to keep the ball in the air. So, showing some high level proficiency here early on in the video. Early on we are seeing a mixture in the height of the touches, but it looks like the player has good touch weight control to take some momentum out of the ball as it comes down from a greater height. As we can see on the screen, ball is up high, the player is looking up here, in this angle here and we can see obviously the ball is up towards the sky in the left hand side screen here but what the player can do well is when the ball is coming down from such a height here it has obviously got more speed so it is going to be harder to redirect that ball up with that extra momentum. However the player does have good weight control to redirect that ball, it's not just a higher touch upon a higher touch upon a higher touch or the touch is coming down and it is being redirected outwards or to the side so the player is able to redirect the ball consistently up regardless of the height that it is coming down from they can again redirect it to a comfortable height to readjust their body and continue to juggle and keep the ball from touching the floor.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So here she steps forward, definitely want to bend this front knee so it's not so straight, and stepping on the ball of the foot as she steps forward, and also remembering to really rotate and move those arms around from the back. So overall, really lovely job with this one. Just a few minor technical corrections, but overall, really great job. So here, nice job getting the right leg around and planted on the floor here. Her left leg is slightly bent with its ball of the foot on the floor, so all of her weight is on her right leg. Arms are extended up and she is swiveling and rolling her body around in this part really well. So here the dancer starts stepping in two steps in place and then stepping out and sliding to the side. Here she stepped out on her right leg. Definitely I think can bend this knee a bit more and really extend this leg out a little bit more. But nice job keeping the arms straight. I do think her eyes can follow her hand a bit more. So turning that head all the way to the side. So here, really nice pose position. This right knee is bent and the foot is flat on the floor. Left leg is extended out with the toe pointed. Nice job there. The arm is extended out. This left arm is crossed over and the eyes are straight forward. So really nice full line in the body for this position. So here she spins around, I stop getting the arms up and extended over the head, getting around in her spot. Again, as she turns, keeping the knees bent so that way she stays nice and grounded to the floor. So here she walks side to side and then twist around. She again is drawing that arm around and the eyes are in line with the hand. Definitely want to keep the knees bent in this so as she pivots to turn to face the other way, it's more of a pivot and less of a slide going side to side.

She continues to be clear with her choreographic presence of her arms, and adds a shimmying into her shoulder which shows that she's able to engage with polyrhythm, embodying multiple rhythms at once. She's able to stay connected to the rhythm and the music as well through her footwork, and has a nice slight bend in her knees, though a bit of a deeper bend would be welcome, and help her to increase her range of motion in her pelvis and upper body. As the dancer begins with a basic salsa step, alternating weight between two of her feet and kind of engaging her arms in a way that's helping her to catch the rhythm, she is able to effectively engage her arms choreographically in a way that's meaningful and appropriate for the movement technique, which is also demonstrating that she has a fair control or a fair understanding over the movement technique. She's got a nice slight bend in her knees, as well as some nice range of motion in her pelvis and engagement of her upper body. As the dancer performs this turn around herself, she is able to do so fairly quickly and efficiently, though would benefit from some more spotting in her head, which would help her to move more quickly through the turn and stay more deeply connected to the rhythm, as well as more of a softer bend in her knees, which would allow her again to move a bit more quickly. She would also benefit from bringing this arm a little bit further elongated above her head. Right now it's a bit crunched up above her head, which is really shortening her line as a dancer. If she were to move this arm so that it was a bit more elongated above her head, it would not only create a better shape in her body, but would also help her to move more quickly and efficiently through the turn. As the dancer begins to take a step out, performing a bit more of an advanced salsa step where she's stepping one foot out, meeting it in the middle and then alternating sides, she's able to maintain a connection to the rhythm through her feet, as well as through this really nice use of her arms, which is really choreographically clear and is really deeply embodying the rhythm, particularly through her arms. A welcome benefit here, or a welcome addition here would be increasing the range of motion in her pelvis, which might benefit from bending the knees a bit more deeply, as well as dropping the pelvis back so that she can increase that range of motion.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Also, her feet are now placed in a bit of an awkward position with both feet pointed inwardly in a crossing position, meaning that her hip is too rotated inward. The dancer was meant to take three steps forward crossing and this third step with her right foot she doesn't finish completely. The dancer moves her weight onto her toes so that she's able to twist right and left. The dancer's arm here can be extended further down so that when she's swiping it in a swoop across from the left side of the room to the right side of the room it has more energy and looks like it's placed more properly.

Again, on the follow-through, he does kind of bring it around and then snaps the follow-through down. We'd love for him to get his shooting hand more behind the ball. Here he just kind of flings it up, and again, a little off balance here with the feet kind of not over the knees or not really over the feet here. So let's balance up here a little bit on the landing. Here again, let's get that shooting hand behind the ball. Let's face the shoulder up to the basket. He's kind of shooting it over his shoulder instead of in front of him. Again, good footwork. We'd love for it to be a lot more aggressive with better, higher knee lift. Here the shooter is attempting a right hand layup on the right side. Would love for him to use his left foot takeoff and to drive that right knee up higher. And if he chooses to go up to two feet to really power himself up off the ground. I love the arm bar is bent 90 degrees. He's extending that shooting hand. Arm up to the basket as it releases. That's the wrist snaps down. Good footwork, better knee lift here. Got two hands on the ball as he transitions to the right side. Again, we'd love to see more lift and elevation here. Hold that follow-through up. It sort of drops down. We'd love it to be a little bit higher here. Here he uses this left foot to pivot and square his shoulders up to the basket. Again, love that he's got two hands on the ball as he transitions up for the shot. But again, just would love for there to be more, a stronger takeoff on that left foot, a really drive that right knee up and just hold this follow through up. You really don't see the follow through at all in this picture. It might be because he's so close to this wall, but love that his eyes and head are up. He does step through with his right foot. He has two hands on the ball. I just would love to see him step with a bigger aggressive step and really bring that right, that left foot around. Really step hard, big step with that right leg, bring that left leg around. With love as he transitions from this to this side, he's got his eyes and his head up.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As you can see, they're playing with flat fingers. Anytime they're trying to find a different note, they're expanding their hand more this way, which is really difficult and hard to coordinate, especially if you're not familiar with the keyboard. They should try to have more of a curved hand so that when they're moving from one note to another, they can move more of their arm and just type with their fingers. They're still testing out some notes to figure out which position their hands need to be to start the piece. You can also see that the pianist is playing with flat fingers, which is not really getting in the way right now because she's not playing super fast, but it would be easier for her to be able to read and play if they use the fingertips. The pianist is still trying to play the very first measure of the piece. They clearly need to practice more. It'd be good for them just to make sure that they're practiced frequently so they become more familiar with the keyboard and how to play. The pianist keeps on making a lot of mistakes. They choose to keep on starting over the piece. This is clearly a beginner playing the piano. They're still trying to acclimate themselves with the keys and know where they're going and reading music. It'd be best for them to isolate each hand and practice those individually until they feel comfortable with each of those lines and then bring them together. The pianist plays a wrong note. You can see that their hands are quite far away, so whenever they're playing they're using the very pad of their finger while their finger is also really extended. I don't think this is helping them get around the keyboard at this point. They can try to make sure that they're in a position that more notes are available to their hand if they wanted to extend and play. The pianist is stopping frequently to see which notes to play next. They're trying to find the correct position for their left hand. The pianist plays the first few notes and then stops to see what the next ones are.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I think really great job just stepping and moving to the music and really listening to the music and honing in on all of the beats and nuances. Here he could definitely bend his knees a little bit more as he rolls back and nice job with the arms reaching up over his head. So it was a really nice transition turn into this side of the room. Really nice clean turn around and then getting his body straight back forward to the front. This is a really great example. Just want to keep in mind like having your energy kind of flow up and down. So it's not always so, so high and then you end up losing control. But just to kind of keep it up and down so you can keep control of your full body. So here the dancer starts. He has a really nice, strong, improv moment in the beginning. And then when he starts the choreography, he does a really nice twist out. When he crosses over in this motion, I could just tell, I think it was too much energy. So he really had to catch himself to keep his balance. So just keep in mind balancing, like, the level of energy you're putting out, but still keeping your body controlled to do the movement. So here when he lifted up his right leg, it did like a little swivel around, which was really good, and he was able to hold his balance as he did that. So the toe made a circle around as he kicked his leg around. So really good job holding balance and just keeping everything controlled. So up through here, really nice job, again keeping the energy really high and it kind of, you know, dipping down. At this point, when he jumps side to side, a really nice jump. The legs are opened out wide. He's using his hips to move around and then also swinging his arms back behind him. So here I like the choice that he made of rolling from the bottom up. So he was able to just bend his knees and pop up into a roll.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

These thirds are a little bit sharp. The best way to fix this is to practice this against a tuner or with drone tones to just get this better in tune. The violists should be playing slightly closer to the bridge than where they are now. The tone of the low C string is lacking resonance. It's because they have to use a slow bow, but a slow bow in the middle where it is now is not going to produce good resonance, but a slow bow closer to the bridge where there's more tension on the string will give us good resonance throughout this arpeggio and scale. In between all these long notes, the violist is doing a couple of kind of precautionary quick down and up bows. The correct thing to do is to just accept the way that you are sounding and try to stay with the pulse and not add in these little extraneous tones. It's understandable why the violist is doing that, but the best thing to do is to practice this slowly and practice it with a tuner so that you're able to play it in tune and in time at tempo. And then when you're presenting it at tempo, don't add in these extra little checking how things are going down and up bows. Just commit to the notes that you are playing because that will actually have a better effect musically overall. We notice this bend in the wrist of the viola, which is a really good thing. We see there's a slight bend here. They're doing that so they don't have to raise their arm any higher to get to those low strings. This is good because any additional raising of the arm is just going to create excessive and non-efficient movement. So that bend in the wrist allows them to get the weight there and to keep their bow hold stable without sacrificing good arm position. So that's a good thing to do here. We're noticing a little bit of subpar intonation here. The way to fix this would just be to play this slowly with a tuner, either with sounding pitches to match to, or just watching the needle of a tuner. So that's kind of slow practice of the tuner would fix a lot of this subpar pitch. We need more finger deliberacy and action, especially when it's really high up on the A string here. We're losing the clarity between notes, so just a quicker movement of the fingers, especially when we're high up on the A string and the notes are very close together. This deliberacy of movement is going to make things a lot more clear in this slur. Because the violist is not ready to play this at this tempo, we have a loss of pulse. The best way to combat this would be to practice this at a slower tempo, gradually bring it up to speed so they're able to execute these arpeggios and double stops at this tempo without losing the pulse. We hear that in these double stops, the violas is rolling out of them, meaning they're not fully sustaining the double stop until the last second that it is required. The fix to this would just be to stay on that same plane and then make a quick but deliberate movement to the next string instead of making a gradual movement off of this plane to the next string. Because when you make that gradual movement, we lose the lower strings tone and then we don't have that pure double stop. We notice that the notes at the top of the scale have much less sound and resonance than the notes at the bottom. This is because the violist is using the same amount of bow for the high notes as the low notes. We have to remember that when we're playing higher up on any string instrument, especially high up on a high string, we have to use more bow. So the violist should expand more bow on the high notes and then less bow on the lower notes, whereas here they're using the same amount of bow on all notes. This is just a note that the instrument being played in this video is a viola, not a violin, so all comments in this video will be directed toward viola playing, not violin. That being said, viola and violin technique are very similar and there are certain fundamentals that will be commented on that are true for all string instruments. We need a slightly faster bow speed here. The placement is all right, but we need a slightly faster bow speed in order to get a resonance out of these high notes on the A string instead of just this kind of wispy tone that we have now. We're hearing slides in this shift. So this last shift that the violist did, we heard a slide. Even though this is a shift in a slur, we have to make sure that our movement is very quick and has a loose weight to it. Meaning the left hand and the arm have to be loose because that actually allows for a quicker and more accurate shift. If there's tension in the left hand like there is here, we're going to hear the shift more the string is going to be affected by the finger still clamping it down slightly as it moves. The tone that we're getting out of the viola right now is a little bit choked, could be a lot more resonant. This is mostly because the violist is not using a lot of bow as they're playing. We noticed that at the change of every bow, they're not quite to the tip and they're also not quite to the frog. Ideally, to get the best tone, we want to find somewhere where we can use the majority of the bow, about 99% of the bow to get that great tone. So a little lower placement, a little placement closer to the fingerboard, and a little bit more bow, we'll get that resonance that we need. At the change from the down bow to up bow, we hear a little bit of a scratchy tone. This is because the hair is not making good contact with the string. This is because there's not enough pronation happening of the forearm into the first finger, especially when we're at the tip. When we're at the tip, we don't have that natural weight. And so because there isn't enough weight, the string skates across that low C string a little bit and gives us that scratching sound. So the violist just has to make sure they're pronating all the way to the tip so that when they turn the bow around, they make good contact with the string. We notice that the notes here are slightly unclear. Part of this is because some tension in the left hand is causing a delayed action of pressing down the strings. So keeping those fingers closer to the string and the left hand a little bit looser is actually gonna make the fingers come down harder and then make these notes in a slur come out more clearly.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She sees her foot and a lot of the floor in her view. Also, the dancer can have more energy in her fingertips. We see here that she's tucking in her pointer finger and her thumb. This should not be the case. Instead, all her fingertips should be radiating outward and not curving into each other. The dancer can move more here from her center of her body. The movement is mostly coming from the extremities, it's coming from her limb or her arms. She should be really initiating this movement from her chest and her rib cage and her arms would be moving instead as a result. The dancer had to adjust her feet. After picking up her knee and while turning, she should plant her feet down firmly. She shouldn't have to shuffle or adjust her feet at all. The dancer is a little bit off balance here on her turn. Her spine is a little bit on an angle, tilted backwards. I don't draw that well. But her spine, she's leaning a bit backwards when she's turning, which is making her off balance. She can also seem taller in her verticality here if she was to also bring her knee up higher closer to where her belly button is. Instead, she should raise her focus up higher towards the wall in front of her. Instead, she can pull up higher also from her head. This would be starting from the base of her spine up to her head so that she's taller in her verticality which would give her more space to execute the turn properly.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

He's hitting the hold, he just needs to hit a little higher so he can get both hands on and kind of control that swing. So here we can see as he is at the apex of his jump, you can see he's maybe just a little bit short. But overall he's moving in a good direction, kind of close to the wall.

He's going to have to kind of pull in with this left hand even harder, really lash and hold that right arm. So overall, just maybe keep a little bit more tension. And one kind of by position thing it looks like he is kind of doing this first move all upper body I think what I like to see is kind of this knee kind of shift more left and have this whole body kind of shift More left so that way you could kind of cut just pull straight up and keep the tension And set kind of coming at it from an angle So here you can see him pulling on to a into a pretty good starting position. His arms are nice and straight You know really nice actively pinching on this big kind of block hold He hasn't taken his right foot off. So he hasn't isn't fully Settled into the starting position yet But overall kind of the only thing notice I think would be is kind of maybe dropping down to the left a little bit. You can see he isn't really hanging plumb from this hold So he's still kind of pushing himself up a little bit So I think that'd be the only adjustment is to start into that especially on pinches Where it's like if you kind of start and then lose your You know, it's gonna be easier to start in a good position on pinches then start and then kind of fall into the better position So we kind of want to start from a good position right away And then this kind of foot swap, so he does do this foot swap to get opposite of po. So he's now got left hand, right foot. But the way that he kind of swaps the feet is kind of jumpy. That kind of looks like it sucks his tension in his core a little bit. Not only that, but his left foot now is kind of just swinging open. You can kind of see his hips are kind of falling back away. So I think kind of cleaning up this left leg, kind of having it kind of flag and toe into the wall, provide a little bit of extra tension support, would be huge. Then kind of right off the bat, he kind of like readjusts this left foot. I think that might be from having to kind of drop into it. But you can see he's still kind of out on this hold. So kind of letting himself sink down and really get comfortable on that left foot and kind of bounce out because his right foot kind of looks like it's bending back and that's going to kind of cause his weight to kind of pull back away from the wall, which especially on pinches, you're going to have to grip extra hard and kind of pull yourself back in. That's going to be really unforgiving with these kind of style holds.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And take a look at the top portion of the square. You can see that it is just below the top portion of the square. So since she was able to place the ball in this location on the backboard, it was able to bounce off of the backboard and go nicely in the basket for the made layup. After she makes the layup on the right side of the basket, she allows, and the ball goes through the net, she allows the ball to hit the ground. When we're performing a mic-in drill, and the ball goes through the net, we want to be in position where we can catch the ball as the ball comes through the net with the proper footwork, and we never allow the ball to hit the ground. The player here is demonstrating the mic and drill where you jump off of two feet and after she makes the layup on the left side of the basket, as the ball comes through the net, she catches the ball and allows the ball to drop down to the level of her waist. When we're doing the mic and drill and we catch her and we get the rebound out of the net after a made layup, we do not want to allow the ball to drop down to the level of our waist. We want to keep the ball high near our upper chest or neck area while performing the mic and drill. After she makes the layup on the right side of the basket, and the ball goes through the net, she catches the ball, and as she catches the ball, she steps to the left side of the basket with her left foot first, and then she's going to pick up her right foot and place her right foot closer to her left foot in order to square herself up to the basket, and then she's going to jump off of two feet to shoot the ball with her left hand off of the backboard and into the basket. This is the incorrect footwork for doing a Mike and Drew when we go to the left side of the basket. When we go to the left side of the basket, we want to first step with our right foot to the left side of the basket, so we'll step with the right foot on the left side of the basket for step one, and then we'll swing our left foot around to square ourselves up for step two. So now that our right foot is here and our left foot is here, we can jump off of two feet and shoot the ball with our left hand off of the backboard and into the basket. After she gets the rebound, she catches the ball and then she proceeds to step to the right side of the basket with her right foot first and then she's going to bring her left foot closer to her right foot so that her right foot is in this position and her left foot is here and then she's going to, and she's squared up to the basket and then she's going to shoot the ball with her right hand on the right side of the basket. This is the incorrect footwork for the Mikan drill. As the ball comes through the net and we get the rebound, we want to step to the right side of the basket with our left foot first.

They throw for the hold and they're able to control it, but it takes a lot of energy because it's a very aggressive way to do this move. And then they place the heel up afterwards. The hands are actually a little backwards looking now. Ideally, they'd have the left hand on the left side. So this may be a difficult position to escape. So climbers kind of sprinting through from the start, but they do begin in a good position. That left hand-foot match allows them to move the left hand into this hold without cutting feet, which saves energy. Anytime both feet are off the wall and they have to swing themselves back on is usually a drain. Yeah, and as a result, they fall, their hand kind of pushes the other one off the wall. So we see the climber really struggling to understand how to use this hold and as a result, they keep swapping feet and changing hip position. If they want to lay back on it, it really would work to have the right foot in but because the next hold is this kind of block shaped pinch, it's hard to use so they don't want to commit to it.

Something that could probably bump his score up a little bit is having his knees already bent, so he's got kind of the full body fluidity going up with the dip. So he's going to his release. Great job. His right foot slightly in front, knees at a good level of bent. He's got his left hand guiding and his right hand in front of his face. Ready to release. Nice high release. Good job. Yeah, I like his approach to his footwork on the catch. It's kind of just closing the gate. So basically he has the right foot out open, just closing it by bringing his right foot forward, which is nice. It's honestly quicker than a left-right, but it's a little harder to do on the move. Good, so it's free throw, so he's got a little bit of lift, which is all you need. Over here on the left, the ego view, great follow through here.

However, the offensive player did not give the ball the right amount of spin to be able to hit our targeted area, which is the right corner, top right corner of the box on the backboard. Instead, the ball's target is on the top of the backboard, which does not give it the proper angle it needs to drop through the rim. Thank you. As we look back on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player does really well at locating its target area before going into his jumping motion. A few minor adjustments we will want to make for the player is to not have the player take off so late. Taking off where the player is at currently, may not give him the amount of space he needs to do his reverse layup. If the player takes off a step earlier, he will have more room to operate and will be less likely to find himself under the rim, making it a more difficult layup attempt. As we watch the layup attempt on the right side of the frame, again, the player has the correct footwork of initially starting with his right foot and jumping off his left leg. Again, we will want to bring the ball placement position higher towards his shoulders to prevent exposing the ball to the defense to allow them an opportunity of stripping the ball and causing an offensive turnover for the player. As we look at this player's finished attempt on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the ball is hovering around our targeted area, which is the top right corner of the box on the backboard. The ball landed more towards the middle area of the box, not allowing it the proper angle to be able to drop through the net. Instead, it gave it an angle where the ball hits the rim and will be missed off the rim and result in an incomplete reverse layup. As we look at this player's layup attempt, on the right side of the frame, again, we will want to bring the ball placement position to be higher above his shoulders, way above his shoulders, to be able to prevent the defense from having an easy access of stripping the ball and causing an offensive turnover. This will also help the player finish more efficiently in comparison of having the ball placement position closer towards the rim compared to it being lower towards the ground. As we observe this player's attempt on his right-handed reverse layup, we can notice on the right side of the frame that he has the correct footwork. He starts out initially by stepping with his right foot first, and then landing with his left foot second, which is going to be his jumping leg, into the right-handed reverse layup. On this attempt for the player to right-hand a reverse layup, on the left side of the frame, we can notice that his follow-through extension hand was rotated towards the right, having the five fingers point towards the rim. The player on this attempt gave the ball the right amount of spin to be able to hit our targeted area, which is the right corner on the top of the box on the backboard, to be able to create a proper angle to be able to drop through the net. As we look at this player's attempt on the right side of the frame, we will want the player's body position to be a bit lowered towards the ground to help create more balance, more power, and more explosiveness on his drive towards the rim. This will also help to prevent defenders from having easy access of knocking the offensive player off his balance while initiating contact. A few minor adjustments we will want to make to help improve the player's efficiency on his layup. On the right side of the frame, we will want to bring the ball placement position higher towards his shoulders area. This will help create more security on the ball before his finish and will also help establish protection and a shield from the defender to not have easy access of stripping the ball and causing an offensive turnover.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So from this spot right here, if the defense is on the opposite side of him, from here they can't get to his shot as he reverses it to the right side of the floor. So by him jumping from directly underneath the basket is the perfect spot for us to take off from when we want to get a reverse layup. As we take a look at the ball placement, we have the outside part of the box on the backboard here and also the top of the box right here. You see the player placed it perfectly right there on the corner of the box. That's ideally the perfect spot. If I can hit that spot without the defense blocking, if I have a clear layup where I can hit that spot, I want to hit the top corner of that box every single time. If I hit that corner on the reverse layup, I'm guaranteed to make that shot every single time. Now, depending on the defense, I may not be able to shoot that shot here and hit that spot and I may have to place it a little further here. So, I may have to place that shot here off of the backboard because the defender may have their hand in the path of me hitting this spot. So, if that's the case, I have to hit it out here and put more side spin on the ball in order for it to go in the basket. But, as there's no defense and I have a clear lane to hit the ball off the backboard with this spot, I want to hit the top corner of that box every single time. If I can hit that spot, I'm guaranteed to make the layup. Again, the placement of this ball is the top corner of the box. He's hitting that spot every single time. As long as he hits that spot on the reverse layup, you're not going to miss the reverse layup. You hit that spot, the reverse layup, every single time with a nice, soft flick of the wrist, nice, soft touch on the corner of that box, you'll make the reverse layup every single time. As you can see, as he goes for the left hand reverse layup, the player does a good job of using the proper footwork and jumping off of his right foot for the left hand reverse layup. As you can see, as he's in the paint, he has two hands on the ball. The ball is below his shoulder, so he has two hands above on the ball. As the ball raises above his shoulders, he transfers the ball to his left hand and he finishes the left hand reverse layup, nice and high off the backboard. As you see once again, he hits the top corner of that left box. He's hitting this spot on every single layup, or every single reverse layup. You hit that spot on your reverse layup and you don't have to put too much side spin. You just have a nice soft touch. You have a nice soft touch and hit that spot. You don't have to put too much spin on the ball. You just have a nice soft touch, nice soft flick of the wrist. As you can see with his hands, right here he's flicked his wrist back towards the basket, but he didn't flick it violently. He did a nice soft flick so the ball will go nice and softly off of the backboard, off of his spot and into the basket. Again, the player here is able to hit that top corner of that box when it comes to reverse layup. As he's doing this drill, he's showing excellent placement, hitting that spot every single time with each layup. Here you can see as he jumps off this right foot, the ball is extended nice and high in that left hand. As you can see his left hand is slightly behind the ball. Slightly behind and underneath the ball. This because he's past the basket as he's reversing his wrist is in the position here to where he can flick the wrist and the ball will go back in the direction of the basket. Also too he does a great job of getting this left knee up high and using his off hand which is his right hand to protect the ball just in case any defenders try to block the shot they will have to go through his arm and by them making contact with their arm it would give by him enough time to go to release the ball in his left hand or also may get a foul call and an and one off of that situation. So this is a really fundamentally sound reverse layup.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

However, if she were to keep this bend in her knees and drop that pelvis back and engage the upper body more clearly, she might be able to move more efficiently and stay connected to the rhythm. As the dancer begins to transition into a larger movement, she does this cross step where she does a slight jump, crossing her right leg in front of her left leg, and then alternating this throughout the space. She really loses her connection to the rhythm here, and continues to really lack any sort of choreographic specificity or rhythmic embodiment in her upper body. And overall, she really just struggles to connect to the music, struggles to connect to the rhythm, and to find clarity in her movement. As the dancer turns to these series of cross steps over herself, she's continuing to struggle with the rhythm here, which we've seen throughout this performance, as well as engaging the upper body. As a dancer begins with a very basic step touch step, she lacks a lot of clarity in her movement already. Her arms are really moving very loosely and in kind of a large frantic way that doesn't quite align with the choreography and the movement. She's able to stay fairly connected to the rhythm through her feet, though she could really benefit from connecting to the music more. And overall, she doesn't have much specificity in her body, her torso, her pelvis, or her knees that connects her to the music or connects her to the choreography. She could use a lot of refinement and much more practice of this step. As the dancer performs a series of steps, kind of scuffing or shuffling her right foot out in front of her with this flexed foot, she does have a moment of specificity in this step. You can tell that she understands the choreography, though she's really lacking the rhythmic embodiment. If she were to connect more deeply to the music here and engage her arms and her upper body, she would really enhance this step. However, this is the first step where you really see her have a lot of clarity of the choreography and understand the specifics of particularly the footwork in this step. The dancer starts to perform a series of small transitional steps, which she appears a little bit to be lacking confidence in this movement, and again lacking clarity. There is no real clear pattern in the steps, perhaps she's attempting to perform a box step or a series of step touches like the beginning, but overall I can't really tell what movement she's attempting to perform here because it is lacking clarity. As the dancer continues through this pattern of step touch where she's stepping one foot out in front of her and then bringing it back in to meet the other foot. She is really falling off the rhythm and struggling to stay connected to the music here. She would benefit from possibly listening to the music before she performs this and also on practicing the step more. She would also benefit from a bend in the knees and a dropping back of the pelvis slightly to help ground her more deeply to the floor, giving her a greater range of motion and able to move more quickly and efficiently.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Here she's now stepping to her right side, but she does a really nice, clean, just subtle release of the back. So when she steps out, her back is kind of rolling and then her arms are placed nicely in front. And the next part when she taps her knee it's right on the beat the drum beat that you hear and then really nice windmill arms they are extending all the way up and down and they flow all the way around her body and she's spinning them from her shoulder which is nice because then you get the full range of motion in the arms. This is a really, really great performance. Definitely give this one a 10. I didn't see really any issues with it. She kept her energy up. You can just see in her face and some people may think the face is not important, but in dance it definitely can change the mood of the entire piece. So if you're happy and moving and filled with energy, the audience will also feed off of that. So not forgetting that your full body is performing and dancing. And it can definitely affect the rest of your body as well. So even if she did mess up, I couldn't tell. She stayed on the beat. She kept moving and just improvised if she needed to. But really, really nice job with this one. From the beginning, the dancer has a really nice, strong presence. She is smiling, she looks happy, she looks like she's enjoying herself. What I did notice in the beginning is her arms are full out with the kick and the twist. She was able to really control her body, controlling her balance, especially when she did the quick half turn and then pause. So everything was just really nicely in alignment for this hearse eight counts. Here, another nice moment, really nice ronde jambe with that leg going around her body. Those arms are really nice spread out to the fingertips. Her face is there, nice front and facing forward for the audience. Just a really nice moment. In this bin, she is spotting the sides, which is nice, a nice change in direction. But she does a really good job whipping her head around very quickly so that way she gets around and then once she's around, she is not dizzy. So for the next take out, she again does a really, really good job. They really don't have many notes or any notes. Just her energy looks great. I love the head roll. It's nice and full. She's facing forward. And her feet are nicely planted on the floor.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I feel like this whole area is very tight and there's not a lot of isolation, not a lot of fluidity. So I would encourage the dancer to bring that in. For any dancer to be more fluid and to release, dancing and moving is about being free and opening the body up. So we want to not hold back and really open up. The dancer must release more in the arms and lift them up a little bit. Right now the arms are tight to the chest and the dancer is moving them in this circular fashion rather than swinging them this way from back to front alongside the body. The dancer's arm should be stretched and extended, and maybe not a bald fist, as if the dancer is punching the wall, but the dance. So it's really just extending the arm forward in the choreographic movement. The dancer takes really big steps front and back. I'd like to see a variation between the steps. So maybe it's one, two, three, and one, two, three, one, two, three, so sustain that third one.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And after getting this right hand here, the climber matches feet and gets the right foot up on the right hand start hold, that sharp end cut crimp, and they're able to go up and lift into this hold, and here they are matching it. And then maintaining this core tension through the right foot here, you see they're kind of bending their knee in. It's a bit easier to lock the leg out when you bend it in. It's not the best technique because it avoids using the hamstring. You want to keep those strong. But turning the knee like this does make it a little easier to lock out. You do get to use the side of your core here. And so yeah, the climber kind of sags into this tension and then is able to come in and match the finish hold. We have the start of this boulder, a good shot of the right hand. You can see, I would either call this a sharp end cut or a mini jug. It's probably more on the sharp end cut side where you're kind of crimping. You can kind of see the flat digit and then it comes up, goes down. It looks like they're kind of pinching it here, but I wouldn't be surprised if as they pull on they take this thumb and even wrap it over and do a full crimp. And then the left hand is a similar hold. The climber is then able to just sag in on this right foot, straighten out the left arm, and come in for this match here. This is a pretty good crimp. I have this crimp on my spray wall. As a foot, you're able to pull really hard away from the hold in this direction. That's what's enabling the climber to keep their hips to the right. This match kind of works with no other foot because you can hold that opposition with just the right. Then after matching, they're able to come out left hand to this pink hold here. After this match, the climber gets the left foot on the left hand start hold, then comes out and tags an intermediate with the left hand, and then that allows the climber to actually get these hips a little further left into the wall, and also get into a more comfortable lock off position in the right hand. And here they are, pouncing up and left into this little mini jug about halfway up the wall. And standing tall off the foot on the kicker, the climber is able to lock down this left arm. And the climber is also smearing with the left foot on the kicker, so it's not on a foot but it's using the surface of the kicker. And they're able to go up and almost do like a little mini wrap on the right side of this hold.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Beautiful follow through here, left wrist is snapped and the right hand is just supporting, but you can see on the right, no lift, no help from his lower body at all. So initially looking at this, there's no footwork used on the catch and he's catching the ball very flat footed, which won't work in a game. So he starts his shot motion here. I like that his dip is starting from below waist level which is a little low for mid-range or anywhere which might be why the dip is so low is because he's not using the power from his lower body at all. Good job though getting his knees bent. He's a little stiff here at the upper body. Wants to be a little more probably curved at the back and a little more hip pinch here.

The only thing that's really hurting him is he's not protecting the ball with two hands and he's a little sloppy with the dribble. He's a little upright here.

I would encourage both dancers to ground through their pelvis so they have more fluidity in their movement and ability to transition faster. Because the dance is so slow, those attention to details in the arms and in the feet are really important. I like to think about creating statues, so every movement should be like a flowing statue through it. So it looks clean and precise. Right now it looks a little sloppy, and I know that's not the intention of the dancer. So I think really being precise about pathway of arms, about using that undercurve, about having that hip articulation and grounding through the feet. All of these basic elements of dance through space, time, and energy will help increase the overall proficiency and look and feel of the dance. I would encourage these dancers to think about frame. So how are they holding each other up, right? Where should the arm, both arms be when they're connected and creating this frame? Oftentimes, the dancers rotate on what part of their foot they're on. So really thinking about should they be on the ball of the foot versus whole foot and making sure that there's clarity in that. Especially in partner dance, it's really important to have power and strength through the arms, even the arms that's not connected. So thinking about the pathway of arms and the precision of movement will help increase the overall look and feel of this dance and its overall proficiency score. I would encourage the dancers to really use this. This is very an important tool in partnering, right? Especially if you're pulling or pushing or leading a partner, that arm and that giving of power or taking of weight show, tells the dancer where to go.

I would encourage the dancers to have really be more engaged throughout their course and also to really think about having power through the arms because that is how you effectively turn someone. I would encourage both dancers to be more grounded throughout this as a swing is very low to the ground and you have to swing your hips like a pendulum. Sometimes they kind of gallop instead of actually swing using their hips as a pendulum to swing back and forth. I would encourage both dancers to be more loose. Right now the dancers feel very stiff, so to really kind of release some of the tension in the body is super important. I would encourage the dancers both to take some time to learn the rhythm because there's moments when they're off of it. So it's really extremely important to be on the beat at all times. There's certain moments they really exhibit solid musicality, but making sure that they're consistent about this will increase their proficiency tremendously. I would encourage the dancers to have a very strong frame throughout their arms and throughout their shoulders and really be kind of lifted in their torso and throughout their neck so they can effectively partner together. I would encourage the dancer that's wearing the headset to make sure that they're following and not leading because the dancer, the standing dancer in the all black has announced that they are the leader.

As a note, you want to make sure you have your hands and arms elevated at all times. As mentioned before, underhanded, standing flat footed won't suffice.

So as he kind of goes up to this, he's going to be going without the force of that left foot, which won't be as nice as if he could keep both those feet on and keep that tension and keep that balance. And, you know, especially when he hits that end move, you'll have just one more point of contact, kind of holding and pulling his hips closer to the wall, keeping his core engaged and his tension there. So he has able to utilize that heel hook to really pull down through that heel almost create a third arm. So instead of having to push and kind of drive the speed, he was able to kind of set that heel on there and really pull down and really utilize his legs to kind of pull himself up the wall and take all that tension, especially on a hold like that where it's so big, so flat, it just makes sense to, you know, put your heel on something that has a large surface area. So overall again starts pretty similar to last time. Nice straight arms but again this left knee is kind of on the inside of the arm and so I think just being let it get out onto the left side of the arm so that way you can kind of come up and rotate and move as far left as it needs to. I can't really see what the right foot is doing. It looks like it's toned down to something. Here might be a little smart of me to put it down onto the to the kicker so that we can kind of push more and kind of push that weight over that left foot just to kind of get his hip set up more towards the left. You can see as he's at the apex of this reach, you can see his hips and his body almost falling back and losing a little bit of tension. So I think this is his first mistake. He places this left foot over here, but he doesn't really look at it while he places it, so I'm not sure how good the placement is. And when he does make the try to make the dead point move up here, that is that left foot that blows. So I think spending a little more time getting the right position, especially here where arguably the feet are going to be more determined of your success than maybe your arms. You know, your arms have to kind of propel you into the wall, but it's like your feet that are going to kind of drive and keep the tension to this high handle. So we want to just make sure that our feet aren't as good of positions as possible. Now again, ops for the high heel, right heel to the right hand match. But kind of seems to be almost rushing it, kind of drops the tension off his left foot a little bit early. Just making kind of this right hand up and over a little bit awkward. There he's just rushing a little bit, maybe his hand position's a little bit off, but it is quite a good hold. You can see on the left it's a pretty big chug. Everything just feels a little bit rushed, he's not in as nice of a position, which is maybe adding a little bit more effort to each move, making every move just a little bit more awkward.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I would encourage this dancer to have more attack or hustle to move quicker because it seems like they're dancing behind the music so they're always like two seconds late to the movement. So really over anticipating and having a little bit more hustle in the steps, moving faster. The dancer is struggling, or seems to be struggling to find the rhythm. I would encourage them to do some deep thinking about and listening and studying of the music so they can stay on the beat and on the rhythm. I would encourage the dancer to think about precision and having more being very precise about where they place their arms and feet and hand and where they're looking being very clear about where they're going each second of the dance. I would encourage the dancer to spot, so look one direction and whip that head around quickly to be able to do these steps, step, turn, step, step, step, turn, step, so they can actually swing and kind of make these circle pathways on the floor with more efficiency. I would encourage them to plie or bend their legs and then also throw their weight into the hip or the direction that they want to lean into so they can travel quickly, fastly, faster, and also kind of make these circles with efficiency and agility because they're working from this kind of grounded position. This would, of course, improve the transitions of the dance.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She's able to perform the steps mechanically, but is really struggling to connect them to the rhythm and really deeply embody the rhythm through her entire body. Just some additional rehearsal, being more grounded in her movement, and finding some consistency between these transitions would be beneficial. During this moment of transition, the dancer kind of resorts to a very pedestrian stance. Her arms are tightly down to her sides and her feet are fairly close together and she's finding kind of a moment of stillness here, which feels a little bit out of touch for the movement vocabulary in this choreography. I think if she were to have a bit more rehearsal and be able to find some refinement in this transition, it would really benefit her to stay consistently deeply engaged with the rhythm as well as with the movement vocabulary itself. As the dancer begins with some basic salsa movements, locomoting slightly through the space, she has a lot of nice clarity happening in her footwork, and she maintains a consistency in incorporating her arms choreographically. However, she would really benefit from bending her knees more, dropping her pelvis back, and being more grounded in her movement to help her more deeply connect to the rhythm and find some more efficiency in moving through these quicker movements. She would also benefit in loosening up her shoulders through her torso, and engaging the upper part of her body a bit more organically and dynamically. As the dancer performs this body roll, she is able to again consistently incorporate her arms choreographically, though could use some rhythmic refinement. However, she would really benefit in this moment of undulation to articulate from the top of the head through the spine and down through the pelvis, which would be achieved by a deeper bend in her knees, perhaps a wider stance between her feet, and a dropping back of the pelvis to keep her more grounded. As the dancer transitions through a turning sequence into this next movement phrase, she's able to turn fairly quickly and efficiently, though could benefit from finding a bit more consistency in the spotting of her head. She would also benefit from finding some more stability in the execution of the turns and then transitioning into this movement phrase.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The left hand fingers are curved. You can also see it from this angle over here. Now the violinist is performing a third piece. Their intonation could be improved when playing the higher pitch in this phrase with the pinky. It could help to practice that particular pitch with a tuner while adjusting the pinky's position on the fingerboard as needed. Here you can see the right hand position is looking good. The right hand fingers are curved or rounded and relaxed while bowing. Here the violinist concluded their piece with a very soft dynamic level and a long legato note. Here the phrases that were played at the beginning of the piece return and the violinist is maintaining a steady playing speed. The violinist is demonstrating good intonation when they are shifting to the higher pitches on the fingerboard. Again here, one of the pitches intonation was off. It would help to practice this phrase one note at a time while using a tuner and watching the left hand finger positioning on the fingerboard to improve the accuracy of each pitch's intonation. Here there was a bit of a squeaky sound quality to one of the pitches that was played in this phrase. It would help when practicing this phrase to keep an eye on the bow, make sure the bow is angled correctly, and that the weight is distributed evenly on the string that is needed to play this particular pitch. They are continuing to shift to the higher pitches on the fingerboard with ease. Here the rhythms in the piece are becoming more challenging and the violinist is still maintaining their tempo and playing with accuracy. Here the violinist has a great sound quality, great tone. They are playing more legato or smooth held notes and they are using vibrato. Overall, throughout this second piece, the violinists demonstrated a great sound quality due to their proper bow hold and technique, their left hand fingers being curved and accurate when playing each pitch, and they maintained a steady playing tempo or speed throughout. The violinist is now performing a second piece. They have begun their piece and are maintaining great accuracy with pitch and rhythm and a clear sound quality. Here the violinist is getting a nice loud full quality to their playing You can see them using a smooth bowing technique and they are putting more weight in the bow to achieve this kind of sound It would help to practice this particular phrase in the piece multiple times at a slower tempo to gain more confidence with the pitches, better intonation, and a clearer sound quality to this phrase. Here after shifting back down the fingerboard one of the pitches intonation was a bit off. It would help to practice this phrase at a slow tempo while listening to intonation using a tuner and watching the left hand finger positioning after shifting back to home position. The violinist has begun performing their first piece. They have demonstrated great pitch and rhythmic accuracy so far. They could put a little more weight into the bow to get a fuller sound, a little louder in volume and just fuller tone.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

In this position we can see that the clamber was hanging on with the left hand. They do have a right foot just underneath their body right here. So this is a good starting position to see with their left hand and right foot because it does allow the clamber to really rotate and pivot naturally. So in this case the clamber would bring the right side of the body closer to the wall and this helps with the movement overall. The one thing I am noticing though is that what she is doing with her left flagging foot. So we can see that her left flagging foot is now getting kicked up and into the air right here. So I do know it's her flagging foot is kind of around the corner of the wall which can be a little awkward to maintain. But by showing me that the clamber is kind of kicking her leg up in the air right here that's showing me that the clamber is focusing on trying to generate her power with that flagging foot there and in that kicking motion. But by doing that it does kind of create an area where she loses control of her movements just because there is so much going on with that leg at that time. So if the clamber had a harder time grabbing onto that right hand hold that kicking foot would probably cause her to fall off the wall. So I would definitely encourage the clamber to really focus on keeping that leg in a static way or just pressed up against the wall in a certain direction from the beginning of the move all the way to the end of the move. So then that way that flagging foot doesn't take away from her movement. And so here's another instance of the climber trying to figure out what to do with her next movement here. But with the flagging foot, which is going to be this right foot now in this case because she was able to switch her feet, we can see that the flagging foot is kind of in a bent position now. So this is again kind of something that we don't really want to see just because with this bent leg, it does pull her body away from the wall. And it does seem like she's having a little bit of difficulty in hanging on to that right hand. So a better way to kind of engage that flagging foot is kind of get it in a much straighter position kind of pressed up against the wall. So you kind of create a lot of tension within your lower body and by creating this tension, it helps to go up into your hip where a lot of your body weight is going to be placed. So then that way you have more opportunity to place your body weight amongst your legs as opposed to your upper body, especially in this case when her hand is in a much difficult hold to grab onto.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Looking at the right side of the frame on our player's release, we can notice that the player does really well at getting his follow through and shooting hand extended above his shoulder to allow the ball to gain the proper arc and accuracy it needs to get above the rim. The player also does a good job of getting a slight lift off the ground, again helping the ball gain more momentum and power it needs. Looking at the player in the right frame, we can notice that he does very well in his attempted jump shot by getting his fall through and shooting hand extended above his shoulder allowing the ball to gain the right amount of power, arc, and accuracy it needs to travel above the rim, developing the proper angle of dropping inside the rim. He also does a really good job of getting a slight lift off the ground by jumping on his shot, again allowing the ball to gain some momentum, arc, and accuracy to get above the rim. As a result from the player's attempted jump shot, we can notice that the ball and the player provided the right amount of arc, accuracy, and rotation it needed to drop inside the rim, resulting in a completed attempted jump shot. Looking at the player's body's momentum, he does a good job jumping forward, allowing himself to land straight up and down, giving the ball a better opportunity of traveling above the rim, developing the proper angle of going inside the rim. Looking at the release of the player on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player again does well at snapping his wrist and follow through downward towards the direction of the rim, allowing the ball to travel towards the accurate alignment it needs, giving it a higher opportunity of dropping inside the rim. Looking on the left side of the frame as our player is going into his shooting motion on his attempted jump shot, we can notice that the player does really well at getting his hand underneath the ball, allowing and creating more ball control going into the release. Also having his guide hand and left hand on the side of the ball, using it as a placeholder, having no effect on the release. Looking at the player going into his attempted jump shot on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player does well using his shooting hand, getting underneath the ball, allowing more ball control on the release, and also as we look on the right side of the frame, he does well getting his ball placement position above his shoulder, allowing a higher arc on the release, and also does well at loading his legs, getting in a squatted position, allowing the player to get more lift and arc on his release. Looking at the right frame as the player is going into his release, we can notice that the player does really well at getting his ball placement position high above his shoulder to allow a higher release for the ball to travel and gain momentum to get above the rim. The player also does a great job at loading and bending his legs going into his shooting motion, again allowing the ball to create some momentum and power and arc it needs to get above the rim, traveling accurately towards the right target area. Looking at the player going into his attempted jump shot on the right frame, we can notice that the player does well using the proper footwork by stepping initially with his left foot first and having his right foot come down going into his shooting motion. Looking at the release of the player's attempted jump shot on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player does a good job getting his follow through and wrist snapping downward towards the direction of the rim, allowing the ball to travel towards the accurate alignment it needs, giving it an opportunity of dropping inside the rim.

You can make his movement more fluid in this particular step by leading with his toe and putting his weight onto his toe instead of onto his heel. The dancer has been looking down. His focus has been on to the floor and that changes the shape of his spine because then his head is tilted forward. So he should be looking instead straight on to the screen. The dancer is stomping down very heavily. He would benefit from being a bit more fluid. It's great that he has so much energy, but he can transfer this energy to his hips so that the movement is a bit smoother. It's great that the dancer strikes this final pose when he finishes his routine. I wish he was not looking downward in this pose. He would seem more confident and putting a punctuation mark at the end of his routine if he was looking straight forward. Also, if he extended his right arm further up, which would also make him look taller between those both things of looking forward and extending his arm straight up. Finally, he could hold this pose for a longer period of time just to announce that he is officially done. The dancer again is standing compacted. It's making him appear to be shorter and this is also making his movement more rigid. He can make his movement more smooth if he extended upward from his spine, from the his coccyx bone, from the base of his spine all the way upward. But what also can help him in this particular movement be less stiff and more fluid is if he brought his shoulder blades downward. His arms can still be in front of him as they are with elbows bent but just releasing his shoulders downward more would create space for his neck. Right now we don't see his neck because his spine is crunched with his shoulder blades up so just moving his shoulder blades down and extending his head upward would create more room and make him his movement look more fluid. Again, the dancer has amazing energy in his upper body. He was alternating which hand he had forward. The hand that he had forward was opposite of his leg, so if his right leg was forward, then his left arm was forward, and that was great energy. What I wish the dancer would also do is move this energy downward into his hips as well. The dancer is opening his feet once in a while here, sometimes not always on the same count. This is a bit careless, his feet should be together. It's okay if they're not glued completely together, but he's purposefully stepping outward sometimes, and he either has to fully step outward, which would be a different salsa step. That step is a basic side or side basic, or also called a Cuban, but what he's doing here is just a salsa step in place, so his feet shouldn't be opening, they should be consistently closed. Again, the dancer is looking down, but not only that, him looking down is also making his body more compact. And the ideal would be if he stood taller, and a way that he can stand taller in his full verticality for however many inches of height he has, is if he pulls upward from his head towards the ceiling, just lifting from his neck through his spine upward. What also can help the dancer step less heavily is if he transfers his weight onto his toes so he'd be light on his feet. Right now he's standing flat footed with his feet flat on the ground and that's part of the reason why he's stomping down so heavily. The dancer has great energy in his chest, but he doesn't have much energy in his hips. His hips should also be moving every time he's stepping with one foot. His hips should be moving in a backwards diagonal, horizontally backwards to the side. Right now, he has great energy in his upper body, but he's not transferring that also to his hips.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And then she's got her right hand up, extended, I like that. I'd put her at a 1. She did a little better at the end, finding an angle towards the rim, but really struggled the whole time. She didn't make 1. She was traveling. Good, she was close to the white square, so a little better, but she needs to kind of angle it better and have less power.

The position that his wrist is in now, that's the position that it should be in from the very beginning of his shot. As you see, the shot has yet to reach the rim. The ball is on its way to the basket. However, the shooter has already dropped his follow-through. Now this shooter, he has a nice follow-through, so it's not that much of a concern for the fact that he's dropping his follow-through. But when you're trying to teach people how to shoot or you're working to improve your shot, especially in practice settings and situations, we want to hold our follow-through until the ball goes through the basket. That way, the shooter can self-correct if anything feels off with the shot. But when you drop your follow-through too quickly, you kind of lose the ability to self-correct based off you holding that follow-through. The shooter is doing a good job with his feet by having his feet squared and his right foot is slightly in front of his left foot. By doing so, by getting his right foot slightly in front of his left foot, that allows for his right elbow to be perfectly aligned to the rim and straight to the rim. So when he does his follow through, his right arm will be pointed straight at the rim. As the shooter catches the ball, you can see that he's stepping and meeting the pass with the left foot first. So that's a good way for a shooter to gain rhythm and gain momentum into his shot and also meet the pass. It accomplishes two things. First off, by you meeting the pass, it lessens the chance of the defender coming in between you and your teammate who passed you the ball and the defender steals the ball. So by you meeting the pass, you cut the chances of that happening and also as you catch the ball and you're stepping towards the basket and you're gaining your rhythm to go into your shot and make the shot. On the release of the ball, you can see that the right wrist is snapped down with the fingers pointing towards the basket and his guy hand is open and the palm is facing the direction of his shooting hand. So his guy hand is in the proper position. as the shooter is going up for the shot you can see that his left guy hand is to the side of the ball and slightly behind the ball ideally we want to get this guy hand slided down to this side of the ball more and as you can see with his right shooting hand as he's raising it up his hand the palm of his hand is actually facing away from the basket. We would like to have his wrist turned so as he's going up into his shot his palm is actually facing in the direction of the basket that he's going to shoot on. Since he has his palm facing this way as the ball is going up and as he's bringing the ball up into a shooting motion as he releases the as he goes in to releasing the ball he's gonna have to turn his wrist in order to get his palm facing the direction of the ball and then shoot the ball. So that's an unnecessary movement that is not needed and there's something that we can correct from this position here making sure that his palm is facing the direction of the basket as he's beginning his shooting motion.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He got back on to the beat of the music He made a mistake before but somehow now he's back on the count of one two three touch four five six seven touch eight The dancer doesn't complete four steps when he turns around. He should be turning around one, two, three, touch four, or at this point the music would be five, six, seven, touch eight, but instead he doesn't do four clear steps. He kind of does two and a half or three here. The dancer is back on rhythm here. He is going in and out of rhythm because he's not completing the same amount of steps each time. Every step that he is doing should be four counts. Whether he's going right, whether he's going left, whether he's going right, turning or turning around his right shoulder, whether he's turning around his left shoulder, whether he's going to the side and then turning or doing two turns in a row, each of those steps should always be in a four count sequence. He sometimes does complete this but other times he does not. You The dancer is lifting his right hip here to step out with his right foot. He shouldn't be lifting it up into the air because when he's lifting it up into the air it's kind of creating an arc going from up to down as he steps. And his steps shouldn't be on this arc but instead they should be level, completely just horizontal outward and not his hip going upward and then down. So because the dancer didn't complete that previous step in bringing his feet together, he moved into the turning step too quickly. So now he is one step ahead in the music. Before he should have put his feet together on the fourth count of that measure, whether that was count four or count eight. But instead he began his turn that should have been four more counts, which he did for four counts. But basically the movement and what she did while he was walking towards his right or left side of the screen only took three counts. So then when he turned around taking four counts, he got there a count early because he didn't do the full four counts in the step previously. So now when he's continuing his movement to his right side, which is also our right side of the screen, he is one count ahead. And this will continue to remain the case throughout the choreography unless he gets back on rhythm. The dancer's arm is extended on a diagonal here. He's raising it, I think, because he is mimicking dancing a partner, which is not really necessary since he's dancing by himself. He doesn't need to be practicing this arm movement, which would be trailing a partner. But even so, with him raising his arm right here, he's not doing it at the proper position or angle. As we see in the Eagle view, his arm is extended at an angle on a diagonal, but really his arm should be extended straight forward in front of him because if he is holding a dancer or partner's arm, her or his or their arm would also have to be on this diagonal now. In this sense, his arm is blocking his face. His arm is right in front of his eyes. Instead, his arm should be straight in front of him so that we can see his face and that his partner's arm wouldn't have to also be dragged across their body. He is completely bachata steps in timing, walking 1, 2, 3, touch 4, walking 5, 6, 7, touch 8. Even when he's turning around over his right shoulder, over his left shoulder, whichever direction he's doing it, all these turns are taking four counts. He's turning 1, 2, 3, touch 4, turning 5, 6, 7, touch 8. So in this sense, he is remaining in rhythm and on the timing of the music. Dancer once again also needs to watch his shoulder to not raise so high and that's also more difficult to keep his shoulder down when he's looking downward as well. So he can help himself keep his shoulder down if his eyes are outward instead of downward so that his shoulder is not getting too close to his eyeballs. The dancer is tilting his spine here. He's leaned over to this side and he shouldn't be leaning over like this. His hips should be moving out right and left. That's fine but he shouldn't be having a breakage of his spine on this angle. Instead his his vertebrae should be in a completely vertical alignment and it's just his hips that are moving right and left. The dancer misses a step here in which he his left foot now steps forward But instead his left foot should have been tapping in to his right foot So now he's gonna be off rhythm because he didn't actually complete that step. He moved forward instead Again here the dancer is focused somewhere he shouldn't be. He is looking down and his arm is covering his face, especially because he is looking down. We see his hand in the ego view which shows what he sees. And in that way we can't see his face at all. So he is one covering his face which he shouldn't be doing. And two he is looking downward instead of looking straight outward. The dancer is still one count behind in music and rhythm because he added that extra step previously. The dancer takes now five steps when he turns around instead of taking four. So now as he's going out to the side, he is a count late in the music. He's stepping out on count two instead of count one because he added an extra step in that turn that he just completed. The dancer is rotating his knee again to the side and his knee shouldn't be rotated. It's a result of his hips rotating and then as a consequence his foot is rotating as well. But none of these, whether it's his hip or his knee or his foot, should be facing the side of the room. Here it is, his left side or our right side of the screen. All of these things, his hip, his knee, and his toe, should be facing completely forward. If the dancer does move his arm up as if he's turning a partner, he has to be careful that he keeps his shoulders down. Right here, his left arm is in the air and his left shoulder is up pretty high, getting closer to his ears. And instead, he should be pressing his shoulders down even as he extends his arms up. He could also make more space in his spine by lifting up from his head so that he remains taller, just extending from the top of his head up towards the ceiling. The dancer is circling his arms. They're out to the side and he's circling them as if he is cranking something or rowing a boat. And his arms should really be in front of his body, alternating between one up and one down, mid-level in front of his stomach, just one higher in space than the other. And then that's alternating with each step that he's doing. Inside, they're outward and rowing in circles. Again, his shoulder is up too high, which is more so noticeable because he is looking downward, so he can help himself by looking outward and keeping his shoulder pressed down, even if he is to raise his arm up. We've just seen the ego view of the screen rotate in every which way and direction. Right now the dancer is looking upward, so the view we see the ceiling. And the dancer is focused and head shouldn't be bopping so much right, left, up, down, all these different directions. His eyes should really be steady outward and the ego view should just be panning horizontally right and left across as he moves. It shouldn't be going up and down at all. That should not be happening. And it also shouldn't be rotating or tilted as it is here. That's because his head is tilted on an angle, but instead his head should be directly straight in line with the rest of his spine. The dancer's knee is also rotated to face his left side and his knee shouldn't be rotated inward like this. His knee should just be facing straight to the front of the room. And this knee rotation is happening because he's rotating his hips to his left side. So as his hips turn in, his knee turns in also as a result, and then his toes also end up facing that left side of the room. The dancer just rotated his arm upward and down, which was not necessary and is also not a way in which he should be turning a partner in case that is what he's practicing in turning a partner. If he was turning the partner here, he would have been linking arms with them and then dropping the arm. So either his hand should have been stayed raised in front of him, but not up and down and not arcing or spinning around this way because then the partner would have gone very dizzy and actually would have interrupted or disrupted his or her or their spin. The dancer once again is looking downward and he's tilting his head on an angle. His head should be straight not tilted and his eyes should be outward not downward. The dancer is not moving his hips in opposition to his feet as previously mentioned, but he also is not moving his hips enough. So his hips should be moving right and left horizontally in a very clear way. It should be very obvious, these hip movements. They should be large and he is not really moving his hips that much here. The dancer is awkwardly poking out his chin and his neck forward so his spine is not aligned It's leaning forward and then backwards here instead of being in a straight line Because he's poking his chin out like this which isn't necessary and shouldn't be happening The dancer here just stopped with his right foot, but his hips are also moving to the right, which is incorrect. When he steps with his right foot, his hips should be moving the opposite direction to his left. So his hips should always be moving the opposite direction of his foot that's stepping out, so long as he's doing this basic bachata dance step. The dancers foot steps are a bit heavy. He's stepping flat foot on each step He's doing with the exception of when he brings his toe in on the fourth step of the sequence He's doing this while in that his toes on the floor and his heel is up. So that is good But all the other steps he's doing his feet are flat. So his feet really Don't need to be as high up as they are when he brings this toe in on that fourth count But counts one two and three his heel should be slightly off the floor not all the way up but only slightly so that he can Travel across the room with more ease and shift weight easily as well The dancer is stepping out and touching his foot together, both right and left, in rhythm. So he's stepping one, touch two, step three, touch four. He's stepping on the odd counts and touching on the even counts, and these are in rhythm and in good timing.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Once again, here she's got a lot of clarity happening in her footwork as she's kind of swiping her arms overhead, showing that she can perform two different dynamics, a more staccato movement with her feet, while performing a lighter kind of slicing motion or floating motion in her arms. Overall, she's performing this moment with clarity and is connected to the rhythm more so than she was prior to this. As the dancer moves through some faster movements here, she's really struggling to find clarity in her movement as well as staying connected to the rhythm. Perhaps some additional rehearsal as well as being more grounded in her movement would help her here. But overall could really benefit from finding some clarity as well as grounding to be able to move more quickly and efficiently through the movement. As the dancer begins with a basic salsa step, moving forwards and backwards in the space, she demonstrates that she has an understanding of the movement vocabulary and is able to incorporate an appropriate choreography of the arms in addition to what's happening in the lower body, in particular the footwork. She's able to stay connected to the rhythm primarily through her footwork, though is really using the rest of her body to execute the choreography. Some places for improvement here would be bending the knees more deeply, dropping the pelvis back, being more grounded in her movement overall so that she can incorporate the pelvis, the torso, and the shoulders into her movement and rhythmic embodiment. As the dancer continues through some quicker movements here and starts to turn around herself locomoting through the space again She's really struggling to incorporate her arms in particular in a way that's choreographically appropriate for the movement vocabulary Perhaps this is demonstrating that she only has a very basic understanding of the movement technique and is struggling to improvise on her own Again would benefit from grounding more deeply bending the knees dropping the pelvis and finding some more clarity in her footwork as well as how To incorporate her pelvis her torso and her shoulders As the dancer transitions into a step touch movement that's a bit more stationary from her prior locomoting back and forth She's struggling to stay connected to the rhythm through this transition This is where dropping her pelvis back being more grounded through her movement and bending her knees would help her through this transition to move More quickly and efficiently. She also starts to lose clarity in her choreography of her arms as well as her footwork here", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The balance between the left hand and the right hand is really excellent. Another example when they're playing that their elbows are often kind of bowed out. They can make sure that they're a little bit more both inward towards their body so that they're more aligned with their hands. The pianist also has really great coordination between the left hand and the right hand. The rhythm is very even and they're very together. Again, they're descending with their right hand. They have this angle within their elbow that's really quite severe. They could try to bring in their elbow more so it's more aligned with their hand. The pianist plays this section of their scales double time to practice their speed. When ascending, often the pianist is using their hand to initiate the movement. They could use more from their upper arm and also their forearm to help guide their hand, so it's maybe more efficient. The descending line, the pianist plays some wrong notes. It would be good for them just to practice this very slowly, so that they know exactly where their hands are going and what notes to play. The pianist is using curved fingers so they can play with their fingertips. This helps them get a more consistent sound and allows them to play scales this fast. The coordination between the left and the right hand to do this is really excellent. As the pianist is playing arpeggios, they're using their wrist in a pivot motion to help them play all the notes. The pianist has really great knowledge of the keyboard. As they're doing all of these scales and different exercises, they're playing all the notes very evenly and playing the correct notes.

It allows us to put good momentum in our body and generate good power in the shot. We can see from here the dynamic has changed as the retrieval player or the player that could have been acting as goalkeeper has moved to the right hand side of the goal and our subject player is now aiming towards the left. With that being said we can see our stance here. The standing foot is pointing towards the centre of the goal which is what we wanted to see from the previous kicks and we can see quite a good technique with the right foot coming all the way across the body to this position here to guide the ball over towards the left hand side of the goal. So it's good technique, good stance, much better in terms of those things there. However the point of entry in this one is still somewhere around here. Room for improvement would be a little bit more along these lines, somewhere along the inside of the posts, bottom corners or top corners. So a couple of improvements in some areas and pretty much the same in terms of point of entry. So, with this one here, again we look at our point of entry, mid height and close to the outside. Good connection, good power on this one. Decent height, I think. Most likely going in even if the goalie guesses the right way. But slight room for improvement would be if the ball maybe entered closer to the post here or slightly closer to the post here. Obviously, there's more risk but just that little bit higher to save for a goalkeeper should it be closer to the post and further away from the centre of the goal. And then when we talk about the point of entry, so the ball is just about on the goal line right now So our point of entry on the goal is here So we think about goalkeepers again being in the net here Trying to make a save they generally drop down low To either the right or their left if they go to their left in this case. This shot is very saveable It's definitely not up near the higher end of the scale in terms of proficiency So I just want to highlight the best penalty of the video so far. Here we can see the point of entry right here, bottom corner. It's hit with a decent amount of power and I want to go as far to say 99.9% of the time. This penalty is not going to be saved by a goalkeeper because it is moving fast. It is very close to the inside of the post at the bottom corner. So for a goalie to get across from starting point somewhere around here and to be outreached and make a save down that far into the bottom corner is near impossible if they are guessing that is. So yeah, with that power I think that ball is going to beat a goalkeeper to that corner regardless of their speed 99.9% of the time. Very good penalty, very good placement, technique and power. What I like about it again is there is not a lot of predictability in the stance as we lead up to the shot. So the standing foot is central. Even here once the shot is right crossing the line, the centre of the screen is still somewhere along this line here closer to the centre of the goal. So a very good example of a penalty kick here. So we are seeing a consistency in the point of entry when it crosses the goal line. So we're around this area here. I would like to see maybe an improvement per kick. We could be calibrating our kicks and learning from the previous ones to get closer to the inside of the post. This distance has not, from here, got better. It's consistently entering at a point where it's kind of saveable for a goalkeeper should they guess fast to their left-hand side. So just to touch on the approaching angle here, this is a good distance. We would not want to go any lower than here, from here to here. It allows the player to take 4-5 steps towards the ball. So as a right footer here, if we draw a central line through the ball, it's our centre line here. We don't want the angle here to be much less than this 45 degree range. If we come from anywhere along this side here, it's going to suggest that we are going to kick our ball towards the right side of the goal. If we can stay anywhere between this side of the angle here, it can be a little bit more unpredictable because we are not approaching from too tight an angle again, which will show that we have to go to the right because the angle will be too tight to pull it to the left. Obviously we don't want to go from the straight back line here because we have to use our right foot and that's going to suggest that we are actually going to go across our body in this direction here. So yeah, a couple of things there just to think about and look at with this player and with the penalty kicks. Lastly, as the player is now looking at the ball, the centre of their screen is still kind of facing this side of the goal. So maybe a little bit of a tell sign here. I'd rather if they were able to get the centre of the screen lined up with the centre of the goal here. So again, it's a little bit more unpredictable for goalkeepers. In this video of penalty kicks we are going to be looking at a number of different things on our criteria. I will comment on them, take notes and at the end this will bring me to my proficiency score. So some of the things on the criteria we're looking at the technique used and the connection on the ball. We are looking at the power or trajectory of the kick. We are looking at the point of entry when the ball crosses the line to enter the goal. Whereabouts the ball is once it is crossing the line that is. Approaching angle or run up. So what angle is the player approaching the ball from and how does it relate to which foot they are using and how does it help them. We're also then going to look at the body shape in relation to the direction that the player is kicking the ball. So are they facing the center when they're kicking the ball to make it unpredictable or are they facing the exact way they're kicking the ball which makes it very predictable for goalkeepers. So there's great connection, trajectory and power on this shot. Very good penalty but still if this is against a good quality goalkeeper, got to think about the distance of the ball from their hands here. From here to here is not a great distance so although it looks a great penalty here, we would want it to be a little bit further over when entering the goal because again if a goalie guesses this way, it's not a massive distance for them to get across if they really commit to staying up and making that save on their right side. But I still think more times than not this penalty goes in because of the power and the speed on it. But if we're playing against a world class keeper, maybe not. Just to touch on predictability here, if we look at the standing foot, the direction it is facing, it is pointing right in the direction that the player is kicking the ball. Obviously if we draw a line down the centre of our screen too, completely facing this side of the goal. So if we think about a goalkeeper looking for visual cues, we're just giving the goalie two visual cues here, in terms of the direction that we're going to kick our shot. The stance, if we look towards the right-hand side screen, is not bad. The centre of gravity is getting low. We're trying to get a good connection on the ball and planting into it pretty well. But again, it's just the direction that the foot and the hips and the chest are facing that is the issue with this one. I'd much rather see a standing foot facing central to not give away any sort of indication of which side we're going to. And also hips and vision, instead of being here, more lined up with this part here. It's also worth noting that in this exercise, if we look at the right hand side camera, the penalty spot is actually located right here. This here is our 6 yard box, the penalty spot is 12 yards. The player is probably kicking at 7 yards maximum. So this is a shorter distance, meaning that the kicks should be more accurate in terms of our aim. We obviously want to be aiming as far away from the central point as possible in our aim. We want to be aiming somewhere along these kind of areas here, highlighted. Top corners, inside of the posts. And the same on the other side of the goal. Anywhere inside the posts or in those bottom corners is pretty much going to be guaranteed a goal should we have enough power to beat the goalkeeper to these spots. Generally, the goalie obviously starts off central here. They're always going to pick a side to dive either in this direction or to dive in this direction with outstretched hands if they're professional goalkeepers, meaning that these are generally the areas to avoid. So if we look at the setup in this one, the player here on the left hand side screen, you can see it standing on the left hand side of the goal. Here, again, left hand side of the goal, to add a bit of realistic, I suppose, accuracy and realistic aim in this one, we could have had this player standing central. Even if they're not saving the ball, it just gives us a little bit more of a realistic setup in this one, where a player taking a penalty kick would usually have a goalie standing in the centre, and they would have to try to be evasive with their movements, the way they're facing. As we can see in this video, if we look at our left hand side screen, our body is facing centrally, facing almost the inside of the post here, which again, in a normal penalty kick, would be a telltale sign to a goalkeeper that our player is kicking to that side of the goal, and which maybe affect their choice in their save selection. So the setup here may be causing the body shape to be forced a little bit to one side, which we may not see should it be an actual penalty kick with a central goalkeeper trying to save the shot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Nothing wrong with that. Love that she's got her elbow bent, the ball sitting in a really good position here. You can see here the ball on her hand, her eyes and head are up. But again, her target is off, she hits the backboard right here, and the ball pops out. Again, she would benefit from just doing repetitious, just face shooting here, flip upside column, over and over. Good extension here, good lift, eyes and head are up, good extension of that elbow. Let's snap that wrist, spread those fingers. Again, did travel, does get her feet turned around. Again, she would benefit from either taking a dribble or maybe just standing here or just really taking a big step on her left foot and pull that right knee up. Here though, she's going off two feet. Great extension, great lift of the shooting arm. This looks really good right here. I like the flexion of the wrist there, the fingers are pointing toward the basket. It looks pretty good here. Again, good lift here, good extension, good extension of the shooting hand and elbow, guide hand is off the ball in a good position here. Again, the ball, great extension here, good follow through here, but you can tell she's kind of shooting it over that right shoulder instead of shooting it out in front of her. I love the lift here, that's nice. She may be falling back just a tad. Let's lean into that shot a little bit more. And again, the ball looks like it's going in the right direction toward the backboard. Again, travels, taking small little steps. Again, I would recommend just one big step with that left foot, pivot, square the body. But I love that she's got two hands on the ball to help, you know, give her a little bit of control and sense of control there. So as she lifts it, her eyes are up, two hands on the ball, nice job there. Again, the ball hits right here and bounces out. Again, let's aim for the top of that square. Just nice, easy touch. She's a little off balance here with the weight just on her left foot. Let's be ready. Let's get on our balls of feet and be ready for the next play. Maybe that's a possible rebound of the miss in a game situation. Here, she either needs to use a dribble, you know, and I really don't care if it's with a right or left hand. I would use my left hand because there's, you know, defense here. You don't have as many defenders here. So maybe left-hand dribble, step through on the left foot. Here she's just taking little steps. She's traveling because she needs to probably dribble the ball to get herself here. But look at her eyes and head are up. That's really good. And she's got two hands on the ball as she moves from left to right. Here, good extension of the elbow. Let's snap that wrist down, point those fingers down. Again, she lands a lot of her weight on her right foot. We want the weight to be evenly distributed over both feet. Again, you can see how her right hand is under the ball. Here, you know, she would really benefit from moving from left to right by just taking, you know, either taking a dribble and take two steps or just one big step on with that left foot right here and then pull that right knee up. I like that she's got two hands on the ball. But you could start, one thing I notice here is that her shooting hand is under the ball. You kind of want it behind the ball and that guide hand on the side. When you have it under the ball, that means you're going to probably flick it up or toss it up, if you will. Let's get our right hand behind the ball and that guide hand, left hand on the side. That's ideally how you want your hands to be on the basketball. Again, let's take a big step where we can drive that right knee up. Good extension here of the shooting arm and elbow. Guide hand is bent there, comes off the ball. Nice job. She's not shooting with two hands. Like how the ball's coming off those fingertips. Let's snap that wrist down. Again, you know, does a good job of gathering, going off two feet here. That's okay. I call it a power layup. She squares her body up. Good extension of the elbow. We just got, we just got to work on at that little touch. Nice, soft, sweet touch off the fingertips, aiming for that top of the square. Here the shooter attempts a reverse right hand layup. She does travel, so I would really recommend her just, you know, working on footwork. Just a one foot step onto that left foot, pivot, pull the right knee up. But here she travels. She is attempting to try to go off the left foot and bring the right knee up. I would spread those feet out a little bit. Again, just really work on just the footwork without the shot, even without the basketball. And then add the shot and the ball a little bit later. But here she does attempt to get it into her right hand. Her eyes are up, so that's really good. In her case, I would have that guide hand, the left hand on the ball, a little bit longer to raise the shot up. Her spacing, I mean you could see the ball here. You know, she's really a little bit far away from the backboard. Probably needs to be a little bit closer. Good extension here, going up on the balls of her feet, lifting and raising those, extending those hips. Here, you know, just shoots it really too close to the rim, hits rim, pops out. Again, she would really benefit from just kind of shooting, just standing here with her right foot in front, left foot behind, and just, I call shoot flip-ups. Just form shooting using that backboard. Hit this top of this square each time, over and over. But again, hits right here and pops out. Again, let's aim for the top of this square. Here it hits rim and bounces out. But again, she's really shooting the ball far away. She has a long ways to go here. She probably needs to be in here a little tighter, a little closer. But look here, I love how the ball goes up into her right hand. Good extension here, eyes up. She's going up on the balls of her feet. Ideally, I would like to see her go off that left foot and pull that right knee up. Probably explode and pull that right knee up. And here, the continuation, the follow-through, would, you know, she would benefit from having the follow-through stay high and extended, snap that wrist. But you could see the ball hits this part of the backboard, and therefore, you know, it's not going to go in. The target needs to be the top of this square where it'll drop in. So just knowing, you know, maybe just standing in here and shooting little shots using that glass, the top of the square would benefit her. But I love that her eyes and head are up.

And so he tries to leave it He ends up falling off and not be able to continue So right off the bat, he's kind of already pulling himself in quite a lot. His arms are pretty bent. So he really pulled his torso up to this hold and then placed his left foot on. So ideally kind of hanging down a little bit more. You know, he is taller, so maybe he is trying to pull himself off the pads. He's a dab on the pads. But ideally kind of maybe shifting his weight over this for a little bit more. So you can kind of shift that knee over to the left. So he's really pushing straight down through it. But I think that's maybe why he's starting a little scrunches just so he doesn't dab onto the pads. Then here again he's kind of doing this foot swap because he's so low. He's getting opposite of pose but I think here he could have just left the left foot on and back flagged that right foot. So you know left foot would be kind of like this, the right foot would be back flagging here so he'd be left hand left foot on. But it would save him this foot swap because then he's going to get his right hand up and then just do the same thing again.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So instead of the arms moving like water, they're placed in very particular manners where they tend to be more linear and create shapes within the body. There's the, and there's also more fists rather than having an open palm where the, from the wrist all the way to the fingertip is moving. At this particular moment, the arms are very more forceful. They're more powerful and they're in this fist position. The one note I would say to improve this is do not forget about the rest of the body. So the legs are very straight. The arms are very straight, but it's important to also keep that head as well as that torso engaged. And it should be reacting to what the arms do. So I would ask questions here. Is the spine supposed to be straight? Is it supposed to undulate? Is it supposed to move in a circular motion? Should it be reacting to the music? Being very intentional about that. But that is such a small detail compared to the wonderful things that are happening with the arms. But I think by moving the, engaging that torso, it would take the movement to the next level. Here, the music is telling us to change the quality of the movement. So the dancer does a really amazing job at showing us clearly what the steps are supposed to be. But I think by engaging that core even more, and being very intentional about where to place the arms, where to place the foot, and having power and energy behind that movement, it shows us that we're in a different part of the music. And it shows us that we are in more of like a bridge in the phrase work. So there's the advanced salsa step, and then there's kind of this breakdown step that we see right now happening. And if there's more power behind the movement at this point, it would tell us that we are in this breakdown step. So ultimately, what I'm trying to communicate is that this is an important moment to change the quality of movement. The first quality was very dramatic, and as it gets to this part of the movement, it should be more staccato or power-driven behind it. The dancer begins with a lovely demonstration of musicality. They lean forward into the dramatic part of the movement, working on the releve or the balls of their feet with their spine erect. They also do this overly dramatic reaching from the shoulder all the way to the fingertips as the dancer sings. Then they sit their hips all the way back and do this sweeping motion with their arms that we can see here. We can also see the leg bent. So that communicates something in dance. It tells us that this is a very dramatic moment, that something special is about to happen, something exciting is about to happen by starting with this very soft quality of movement. Here the dancer does a great job of showing us how to move very quickly. In order to create more accuracy within the movement, I would push my releve even further or dance on the balls of my feet with my spine even more erect. In order to do that, I would engage those core and even those obliques, pulling it super tight. So I'm working in a very small circumference. So because I don't have this wide range of motion, I'm only working in this very small circumference, it's very easier for me to be quick and accurate and very intentional about where I place the feet. And so I can have really quick, fast, sharp movements that this person, this particular phrase work requires for at the close to the end of this dance. The dancer demonstrates a lovely flow in the arms. As the feet are moving super fast, we see that the arms are moving like water. From the shoulder all the way down to the fingertips, they move in circular motions. They move up above the head. They do some wonderful things that keep the flow going and transitions from one step to the next seamlessly. So I commend the dancer. This is a really great job on doing that. And the great way for dancers to practice this is to focus on the arms. So they can sit on the ground and just focus on doing the dance without the footwork, just practicing the arms. This dancer shows that it's possible to do both at the same time and did a great job showing us how. The dancer transitions to a more advanced salsa step. They complete a series of turns and then they end up in this back corner into this movement that we call a layout. We see that their leg is pretty high. It's above parallel to the ground. Their arms are back. In order to go further into the layout and create, instead of this parallel position, a more layout position where the head is toward the ground and their foot is aimed towards the sky, I would bend the standing leg and then drive that head even further down to the ground, engaging that core in order to have a more dramatic and powerful layout that matches those first introductory steps that were overly dramatic at the beginning of the dance work or the phrase work that we saw from the same dancer.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

When further practicing the finger style exercise, it would help to watch the right hand, use the thumb as kind of an anchor to always start on and play the lowest pitch, and then just focus on which fingers should be playing the remaining notes in the chord. Here the guitarist is playing some 9th chord arpeggios. They are keeping the fingers curved and getting a clear sound. Here they are demonstrating how they prepare the left hand to play arpeggios. You can see they are extending the left fingers out and they are more flat. Here the guitarist is demonstrating an ascending major scale. You can hear them slow down when approaching the last few pitches at the top of the scale. Here they are demonstrating a part in the piece where their pointer finger will go back and forth between the first and third frets while their pinky stays planted on the fifth fret. Here they are showing a different left hand position where the fingers are more curved over the strings. Here, there was one mistake made in the pitch when performing the scale again. They slow down a bit when playing the final three pitches in the scale. You can also see that they're using their thumb and pointer to pick the strings rather than a plastic pick. The guitarist is demonstrating a phrase in their piece where they start in first position or home position and then have to transition up to a chord that starts on the fifth fret. Here the guitarist is demonstrating some finger style chord progressions where you would play the bass note or the lowest note with the thumb and then the remaining strings and pitches repeatedly they are playing in an inconsistent tempo and separating the chords it would help to just practice these at a Consistent slow speed and then work them up to a speed that they could be performed one after the other When keeping the fingers flat here and transitioning up the fretboard you can hear there's some incorrect notes being played. They are now performing the ascending and descending parts of the major scale together while doing an alternating picking pattern with the right hand fingers. Here they are playing a seventh chord followed by a major seventh chord. You can hear in the major seventh chord one of the pitches is raised. Here you can see the pointer finger is extended to reach a lower pitch on the fretboard.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They are doing a good job at playing their repeated notes, which are more staccato and separated in the left-hand part, and some of the pitches in their right-hand melody. They are sustaining or holding longer, and they're getting more of a legato or smooth and connected articulation on these particular notes in the phrase. Here the pianist did an excellent job at transitioning into their next section of the piece. They returned to their original speed and are successfully performing their repeating pitch with their left hand thumb at an even tempo. Here the bassline part played in the left hand could have been played a bit more smoothly and steadily. It would help to review this phrase a few times left hand alone to get more comfortable with this pattern of pitches and to be able to play it at a more even speed and smoothly. The pianist performed the previous phrase left hand alone. They did a good job here at adding their right hand back to perform this next phrase hands together. When they performed the beginning of this next phrase, their left and right hand parts were aligned perfectly well together, and the rhythms were synchronized. Here you can see the left hand thumb playing the same key or pitch repeatedly at a fast even speed. You can now see the left hand is shifted to a different spot on the keyboard and the pianist is demonstrating good hand position. All five fingers are curved around it over the keys of the piano. Here the pianist is adding a bit of embellishment or extra pitches to their right hand melody, which is making the melody sound a bit more interesting here. The minor mistake in pitch or the extra incorrect pitch that was played did not slow the pianist down or throw them off at all. They are continuing on with the rest of their phrase and are maintaining a steady tempo. Here the tempo sounds more even again as the left hand plays a pattern in the bass line with multiple pitches. Here there is a bit of fluctuation in the tempo. The tempo is speeding up and it does not sound intentional. Here the aim of the right hand third finger was a bit off. It slid and played these two white keys at the same time when it should have been a bit more curved around it and firmly planted on the one key and pitch that they intended to play here in this phrase. Here the pianist is demonstrating nice finger crossing technique in their right hand part. They are varying the melody a lot here and are playing a more rhythmically challenging phrase. The pianist is performing a bass line in their left hand part and the more melodic line in their right hand part. Certain pitches in their left hand part they are playing and repeating several times in a row. So right now you can see them playing this particular key and pitch with their pointer finger of the left hand repeatedly at a fast speed. Again here, the pianist is adding some embellishment or extra pitches to their right hand part to vary it a bit and make it sound more interesting and musical. Here the pianist is gradually slowing down their tempo to make this phrase sound more finished and complete before moving into the next section of their piece. Now you can see the right hand fingers are extended to cover and play a wider range of notes needed in the melody. The pianist is doing a great job at performing their repeating bassline notes in their left-hand part while the right hand plays the melody. Both the left and right hand parts are aligning well together rhythmically. In the right hand part, the pianist is playing some single line melody and is now incorporating some chords into the right hand part as well. Here you can see the left hand fingers are extended to cover a wider range of notes, and currently the left hand thumb and left hand pinky are taking turns to play a pattern with the lowest and highest pitches in this range.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

But to kind of move off of it, he's really going to want to load into it and kind of pull his hips higher. And so that's going to kind of probably involve taking his knee and moving it over here and really pulling through with his hamstring and like really pulling his weight to the side. And really tensioning that heel hook. Right now it looks like he just kind of sets it on it. And when he does fall off, it looks like it just slides off.

This is a real moment of shine or kind of a high point for the dancer. She's got fairly nicely shaped arms, though they could use a little bit of clarity, but she's effectively incorporating polyrhythm into her body, moving her upper body or her shoulders at a different tempo than her feet or a different rhythm than her feet. She's also got a lot of nice clarity in her feet. She's got her knees bent, her pelvis dropped back, though she could always be a little bit more grounded, but overall this is a high point for the dancer. As the dancer begins to perform this series of quicker movements, they continue to maintain this kind of up and down bouncing quality in their movement, which is really disconnecting them from the rhythm and also keeping them from being grounded in their body. If they were to drop their pelvis back and bend their knees more, focusing on this kind of weighted grounding in their movement rather than this kind of up and down bounce, they would be able to find a deeper connection to the rhythm. They would also benefit from some clarity in general in the use of the arms and the upper body. As the dancer begins with a basic salsa step, moving forwards and backwards in the space, they demonstrate a fairly elementary understanding of the movement vocabulary. They are able to incorporate their arms choreographically in a way that makes sense, though is lacking attention to rhythmic embodiment. And same thing with their feet as well. They would benefit from bending their knees more, dropping their pelvis back, being more grounded in their movement, and incorporating their head a little bit deeper into their movement. Right now their focus is kind of shifted or fixed upwards. If they were to incorporate the movement of their head, their chest, and their upper body overall, they would be able to more deeply embody the rhythm. As the dancer performs this turn around herself, this kind of chaine turn locomoting through the space, she falls off balance a little bit and she is spotting her head slightly, though she would benefit from some clarity in using the spot of the head. She would also really benefit from some clarity in the shaping of the arms, which are, she's struggling to find clarity there. Again, she needs to drop her pelvis back, bend her knees, and overall be more grounded in her movement to move more quickly and efficiently through this turn. In this moment of transition from this basic salsa step into some quicker steps that the dancer is going to be moving through in just a moment, they struggle through this transition. Here they kind of stand in a very pedestrian manner, they don't incorporate their arms in a way that's choreographically appropriate for the movement vocabulary, and they have this kind of up and down bouncing quality to their movement as if they're preparing to head into the next movement series. Overall, they would really benefit from some additional rehearsal and finding clarity in how to transition from one step into the next without having this very kind of obvious transitional moment.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Dancer has excellent isolations, pivots. The dancer moves very well, shifting in the weight in the hips so that the dancer can turn very easily. Here the dancer, when they bring their arms around, can do a stronger body roll, isolating the top of the body with the shoulders, the upper chest and the rib cage, and the torso. That can be a little bit more of a ripple effect, making sure that the dancer goes through each of those areas for isolation.

So she's got this hold that's got a positive side on the one side, but it's also got another positive side on the other side. And so she starts off underclinging. And that's what she probably should do is because right now she gets high, the higher she gets on this hold, the more likely she's gonna kind of pull out from under it, where she could kind of get compression from the underside. So she would kind of compress and apply pressure inwards between these two holds. And actually on the undercling, the higher she gets. And here we can see she's kind of doing this twist lock technique. So she's getting up to the pose, left hand on, right foot on, left foot flags out, toes into the wall. I'm kind of applies pressure this way to push her to the right. And she kind of twists into this arm. She's not twisting as much, but that right hip is coming in closer to the wall. So she can kind of stay steady and make these long reaches. So she's kind of starting with her arms straight and what this is gonna let her do is really drive her toes into the wall and lean back and she's also not because right now she flexes her arms in because she's on this undercling so her palms are facing up so if she pulls herself in she's just gonna pull herself to this hold. That's not gonna do her much good. And actually the undercling the higher she gets the better it's going to be so the more she can be opposite it. As you can see for the undercling her body wants to be up and to the right where this hold is. But when she's on this top part pulling down her body wants to be down and to the left the opposite of this hold. She sets this heel hook so this foot is kind of angled up, it's big, positive size facing off to the sides, this is kind of a perfect contender for a heel hook. Basically what she's going to do is just set that heel on there and then pull straight through that hold. Then that's going to kind of take the leverage and tension from her arm and free that left arm up to move. Here you can see she's not, she's mainly grabbing with the left hand. She's also kind of pinching and assisting with the right arm because she can even take like 20 pounds. But 20 pounds her left hand doesn't have to take. So anytime you can kind of assist with another hand it's usually a good idea. You never want to be like solely on one arm.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

In this case, the climber when doing the switch, she has lost slightly pressure at the grip and this is sliding off the hold. The reason why she's jumping over the grip in order to replace the hand over the hold as it's flat at the top. The climber must consider and continue to apply pressure at the grip. As we can see the climber continues to force the areas of support to pull herself in and this is so the climber can lose some pressure at the right hand grip that had come into place. This is so the climber is able to place the hand further in on top of the hold so that way the climber can have more surface of the hold on the grip. If this climber was to attempt this problem again, it's important that she chucks up the hands. This will help the climber to gain a better grip when sustaining the holds, especially on the hold that she was trying to sustain that she kept slipping away from. The climber continues to readjust the right hand grip while continuing to keep the left foot in place. This was not ideal for the climber for her to be slipping off the hold, which is why the climber when trying to reapply the hand placement, the right foot had touched the mat ending the climb. The climbers is starting at a one-hold start where she places both of the hands into the same hold. This is called matching. The climbers is leaning to the lip of the hold by closing the grips by engaging the fingers inside of the hold and the thumbs over the outside to squeeze the grip. Now as we can see the climbers is starting at a sit start and sit starts are known to add a grade of difficulty to the climb because the climber will have to raise the hips to transfer over the weight to the placements. Now as we can see the climbers glancing over at the right foot coming into place at a foot chip. This one being a very shallow surface the climbers placing the toe over the hold and once a climber is able to create pressure then she will be able to lift up the hips off the mat starting the climb. When the climber is struggling on sustaining such a grip as it's flat and open-handed, it's because the climber is potentially building moisture between the hold and the palm and makes it slippery for the climber to sustain. Now the climber is trying to sustain to the very edge of the hold by closing the fingers to sustain it. Once the climber has secured the right hand placement by dropping the weight, she then glances down at the feet. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet to make sure that she makes an accurate foot switch. On this one the climber is bringing the left toe to come into place before releasing the right toe from the foot placement. In this case the climber is barely able to watch the foot switch so she is going by feel. Here we can see how the climber immediately after lifting the hips she quickly pushes down onto the right foot to bring the right hand over to the next hold that reach. Now as we can see the left leg has gone extended. This is called flagging out and helps the climber to transfer the weight to the right foot being in place. Also the climber had brought the right knee to come inwards and helps the climber to keep her right side of the body close to the wall helping the reach. Now we can see how the climber is placing the palm over the flat area of the hold which is at the top and the type of hold she's sustaining is a pyramid like so the climber is able to wrap the fingers around the edge of the hold to hook the hand over the hold to create more friction and a stability on the grip", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He's got two hands on the ball. Here comes that right leg in behind, working really hard to get this angle. But again, you know, he's choosing to raise it and shoot it up over his shoulder. Again, times it greatly with that left foot push-off, raising of the right knee, takes it up with two hands, maybe sticking it out a little bit as he raises it up. Again, eyes are up. Nice job there. Here's the lift, push off, hips rise, again, raises the ball up, lets the guide hand come off. Again, this is another way to shoot a reverse layup, is to shoot it back over the head. Again, it's not as probably what I call fundamental and basic because you're not squaring your shoulders on the shot. I mean, this is another skill level here, but nice job. Again, he again goes off the correct foot. He lifts. He's choosing just to kind of shoot it back over his shoulder. You know, I prefer facing and being more fundamental, but this works for some people if they can really extend their body up and stay with it and keep their eye on their target looking back over their head. But here the ball leaves the hand here. It looks good. He keeps his other arm up here for balance and control. Nice job there. Here's the shot that comes back over the head. You know, again, it's another way to shoot a reverse layup. Takes one big dribble here to set up his footwork. There's the dribble. Eyes are up. That's what I want to show you here. He's not looking at the ball when he dribbles. He's looking at his basket, his target, where he wants to be in relation to the basket to finish. Here's the shot. Again, not real, you know, not squaring up to the basket, facing the basket like I would like to see. He shoots it across his shoulder, but that works for him. Here, see how he shoots back over his head? I mean, you've got to spin that ball right off that backboard. It's got to hit just right. But he does, he's got good lift. He's got good body control, uses his left arm to help maintain his body balance. Here's the lift, shoots it back over that right shoulder. Again, not my preference, but again, this works for him. He stays with the shot, hips are up, feet are pushing off. Nice job. Here the shooter is shooting, going from left to right, shooting a right hand reverse layup. He's pushing up hard off that left foot. You know, he's choosing to really drive under the basket and kind of shoot back over his head. A lot of people shoot reverse layups like this. It works. It's not as fundamental because you're not really squaring up your shoulders, but it's effective. And he's going hard. He's lifting. You can see he's looking back, but he's got a great... I love how the ball comes off these fingertips. Again, not as fundamental because you're not squaring up your body to the basket. Here's the shot, good lift, footwork, love his body control here, shoots it back over his shoulder, but he's got his eyes on the target, which is crucial here. I love how the ball comes off the fingertips. Again, not squaring up, but this is how, it's another way to shoot a reverse layup, especially if you're coming in here dribbling kind of what I call flat here in line with the basket. It's not like you're coming in at this angle, it's more driving the baseline. This is the baseline. Here's the finish. Again, I love how he lands. He's bent. See how he keeps looking? He keeps looking back at the basketball. Again, does go off the correct foot, raises that right knee hard, really love everything about this. See that guide hand come off. Again, it's not an easy thing to do to shoot it back over your head. He's not squaring, which is probably why I gave him a nine. I prefer to face up and square and be really fundamental here. Again, two hands as he picks up the dribble. I like that. Footwork is really nice. I love how he finds where he is. He's looking up, not looking at that dribble. Again, here's the plant. He's got the ball in two hands. I would prefer to be more up and tight to the chest. You know, a defender could strip this away, but he's got two hands on it, so he's being a lot stronger with it. His eyes go up. So see how he shoots back over his head and he's not square. So some people shoot this when they're really driving hard, what we call driving the baseline. They shoot it back over their head. Again, you've got to stay with it. You've got to, that ball's got to come off, you know, really high on that square to have a chance. But he gets up, he extends, he's looking back, he's staying with the basketball.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Again, there's really no energy in the legs. It's just sort of, this left leg is just kind of, I don't know, dangling isn't the right word, just sort of resting against the right one. It's just too way too pedestrian. It looks like she's just sort of hanging out, you know, talking to someone up, I don't know, in her daily life. Um, and so because this lacks specificity and looks quite weak, it really detracts from what's happening up here. And what's happening up here is also too small. It's quite weak. She's doing an okay job with this elbow being out, but this one's a little collapsed in. So there's a lack of symmetry and consistency there. Um, she's focused mainly on moving the, um, arms and the head. I'd love to see if she could add a little bit of her upper torso to add a little strength and be able to make the movement bigger. Um, as it is, it's too small and too, um, just not enough energy. Again, incorrect turn technique. She's planting a foot, rotating around the hip, and then with an external rotation, rotating the body around the hip. But then you can see what happens then is because this foot is planted, everything, this hip then gets turned in towards it. Then she plants this foot and rotates around it like that. So what ends up happening is rather than one or two fluid movements to make one single turn or two to four movements to make two turns, she ends up making like four movements a turn because she has to step, step, step, step. So it doesn't look efficient. It doesn't look smooth. It just looks kind of clunky. And also the arms are not in a really good shape, so they're not really supporting her. Again, it's not specific enough here, and it's not precise enough. Again, she makes a good shape but has to drop it immediately because she'll be late for the music and that's because she's not attacking and putting enough energy into making the shape to begin with, so she doesn't have enough time to hold it. And so the shape was nice, there was great energy out of the fingertips, but it doesn't register as a shape because she has to drop it so early because she didn't move into it quickly enough because there's not enough attack or energy. Pretty good job with these windmill arms here. I wish that she'd started with a straight elbow. She started with a bit of a bent elbow. She brought it around, but she's recovered pretty well from that. You can see this elbow straight. This one's pretty straight and she's doing this windmill movement with the arms and she's continuing it up as she's walking backwards, which is really nice. So this is an example of being pretty full in the movement with more energy through the limbs. Here she's beginning this sort of arc down with this arm. Great job with energy out of this arm and a nice straight elbow to make the arc happen. She's in a relatively weak position here. She's got her weight very forward on her feet. You can see that the balls, the heels of her feet are out in the air a little bit here. This would be a much stronger position. She could get lower to the ground and make a more dramatic arc, again, more exaggerated arc. Exaggeration's kind of the main word for her. She could make a bigger, more exaggerated movement if she had flat feet and her feet were a little further apart and used her plie and the turning of her pelvis and spine to make this shape much bigger and stronger. The way that she's doing it here looks quite shaky and awkward because she doesn't really, again, follow through and make it big enough for all the reasons that I just mentioned. That was a great example of follow-through. So you can see this hand is here on her shoulder. This is after her hand came in front of her face and then all the way behind her head before she let it drop. So that was an example of good follow-through that I'd love to see her incorporate throughout her entire piece. And the reason that it was good follow-through is because she put enough energy into it to get it all the way behind her head before she ran out of music. So again, she needs to put a little bit more energy into it just like she did with that arm. So here she's bringing her arm up and around. I think that you know if she were at a club or just sort of grooving on her own that this arm movement would be perfectly acceptable and look really pretty but she's not, she's performing. And so it just looks weak, again not a lot of energy coming out of her body. She's not putting a lot of energy into what she's doing and it comes across in moments like this. So this arm with this bend in the elbow and bend in the wrist it just looks super super weak and she doesn't, she makes a tiny circle here in the air. This really would have been much better if she'd had a straight arm and made a big arc. She's got plenty of time to do that musically, she's just walking here with her feet. And so especially because the footwork is so so simple and pedestrian, not to say that that's wrong that's just what the choreography is, the footwork is so simple the audience is going to be looking more at the arms, the upper body, the facial expressions, the head and to see this little chicken wing arm doing a tiny circle is just not interesting. So I just really wish that she would put more energy into what she's doing and just go for it and try some things a little bit bigger, more exaggerated so that it has a performance quality to it rather than the quality of someone sort of just grouping on their own. Much better here. This is the first time that I've seen her really put a lot of more energy into what she's doing And this is one of the most successful moments for her It's just a very simple step where she's sort of crossing her feet in front of each other. She's walking forward She does add a little pizzazz a little sharpness a little attack to what she's doing Which again makes it so much more interesting to look at She's also being pretty specific with the arm shapes and they're well coordinated with the legs So this whole section here, she's doing this front back side sort of basic movements again, just there's not a lot of energy. She's got so much music and so much time, she could almost be leaping into these steps to make them big and exaggerated. You know, it's not super impressive to watch someone do something very, very small, especially when it's obvious they have time to and the skill, she has the skill, she just isn't employing it to use up the space to make some really strong, clear shapes. She's not doing that here. So it just looks quite weak. Another example of lack of follow-through here, she didn't do an adequate plie in her right leg, so she didn't do an adequate leap into the left. She is landing with the soft knee, which is great, but you can see that her weight is pretty far back here. What she needed to do was get the weight really well balanced over this foot so that the other leg could swing around in a really big way, but because she didn't do that, because her weight is back, because she didn't take a nice big leap into that foot, that means that she's not gotten this leg even close to all the way around before she has to put her weight back on it so she doesn't fall over. So she's already completed the movement before she's even halfway around in this turn. She's also already dropping the arms at this point, so again, lack of follow-through for all the reasons I just mentioned. She's doing a little bit of shoulder movement here, but this motion that she's doing is more focused on bending and straightening her elbows. And I think that this was supposed to be a shimmy. So I'd love for her to get more clarity from her teacher on how to do a shimmy. The arms are still in a shimmy, except for at the very top where they're reacting to the shoulder. The shimmy is all about the shoulder movements between the two shoulders connected by the two collarbones. And she's moving the elbows too much to make this a successful shimmy. So good job making a nice arc again pathway in the air with straight elbows. I think that was I Know that I was a really good pathway. However, I would like to see more energy out of all of her fingers Again, there's just a low energy vibe to her dancing and this is an example of that She also doesn't quite follow through with this arm She's already starting to bring it down before it's kind of fully completed its arc So again follow through one way that she could be more successful at this follow-through besides putting more energy into what she's doing It's putting more attack into the arc so that it can happen More quickly and get all the way around before she has to move on to the next step So she has a great understanding here of how to do these sort of rolls with her rib cage. Really good job isolating just the rib cage and not moving the hips very much or the neck. Unfortunately, the lovely movement here is obscured by the arm movement, which she is allowing to be doing sort of the same pattern as the rib cage. And so we really don't have a chance to enjoy the nice rib cage movement here because we're being distracted by the arm movements, and especially because the arm and the rib cage are not super well coordinated with each other. And so what would be a lot nicer is if this arm was in some, both arms were in some sort of a stillness so that the focus could be just on the rib isolation. It's obvious that one beat ago she forgot what she was supposed to, or one bar ago she forgot what she was supposed to be doing, because she kind of started to move like she's moving here but to her left. But she was still gazing forward and her arms weren't quite in this shape yet. And then all of a sudden she starts moving more fully and brings the arms out to the shape and looks down with her head. So she made a little mistake there, but she did a good job of covering it up. She didn't react with her facial expressions, or she didn't say anything, or go, oops, or oh no, or anything like that. So that's good. So she started the choreography here. It's a little bit late behind the music. There's a big cymbal crash on the beat and she's kicking her leg out and making this shape with her upper body a little bit after the crash has started and so it looks like she's late. There's not a lot of strength behind this shape or this movement. The kick really only gets to about here before she immediately brings it back in so there's not any lines created. There's plenty of time for her to do a full kick with a straight knee so I'm not quite sure why she doesn't do that. Well I think it's because she's not putting a lot of energy into this choreography. She does a little bit more push to make these make her movements more full including this kick. Also not a lot of energy through the ankle so the foot is sort of dangling there. I'd love to see a line from the hip to the toes with plantar flexion of the ankle. Arms are also quite weak, non-specific, quite imprecise and so you know it's not a great way to start because it's not clear, it's a little behind the music and it's just not very strong. Here she's completing her windmill arms, but she's already bent the elbows here, so she's kind of not quite following through with the windmill arms, which is unfortunate because again we're losing some of the nice things that she's doing in the way that she's finishing them and not following through. She brought her arms up into a nice shape and here she's bringing them back down again. The arms went up too slowly and are now coming down too slowly again to have any oomph, pizzazz, or just not enough energy. I'd love to see her attack more and again put more energy into what she's doing because the nice shape that she made at the top of this movement is lost because it lacks texture. So here she's done this turn while bringing this right knee up. I love that she's turning on the ball of her foot. That's great. That means that she's got a small pivot point to rotate around which makes this turn a bit smoother. The leg coming around here, I'd love if again there was more energy in this. It's sort of just hanging. It's almost like even wrapped around her leg a little bit. Rather than using her muscles to hold a nice strong position, she's sort of resting the leg on the other leg. Another thing is that it really looks sort of like that she's initiating this kick and this turn using like a crunch through her torso here, lifting her hip and her shoulder. That just shows that she doesn't have a good sense of coordinating her whole body using her core, her pelvis to help her turn. She's using these weaker parts of her body to help her turn which is really common for beginning dancers. This is really nice. She's doing a shape here where she's kind of drawing a pathway with her pelvis upstage while sort of doing this circle with her arms in this direction and it looks really nice and clear. She's also doing a good job so that motion with the pelvis is giving her movement this sort of back and forth feeling but at the same time she's going up and down by straightening and bending her knees as she's stepping out and in. So this is a successful step for her. So she's doing some turns here. She's taking two big steps to make the turn be very efficient. She's also more using her hips as her pivot point rather than the balls of her feet. You can see she's planted this foot here. So what she's doing is rotating around one foot, stepping the other one down, and rotating around that. Sorry, rotating around one hip, stepping the other foot down, and rotating around the other hip, which means that her turn has multiple movements to it. Plus she's taking pretty big steps, and so it's going to have this sort of jerky, bouncy, inefficient, not very smooth or elegant quality to it. So what I'd recommend she do instead is turn on the balls of her feet and prepare for her turns with the plie through both feet. This is a nice little moment for her. It's a tiny, tiny little shimmy again. I'd love to see a little bit more exaggeration, but regardless I like that she's looking over her shoulder while she does this. It's well timed with the music. The gaze over the shoulder gives it just a slight little attitude, a little personality to help connect her with her audience. Here she's doing this side to side movement with the hips by rotating the side to side movement with the knees by rotating the hips in the same direction and then the opposite direction. She's doing a good job of being on the balls of her feet here which helps to keep the movement small and pretty sharp. Arm shapes are okay. I'd love to see a bit more clarity and specificity there. She's not super successful at this movement and I couldn't figure out why at first but I figured out it's because rather than just simply rotating the hips and letting the knees swing side to side, she's actually straightening her knees slightly and then coming down. So rather than a very strict side to side movement, she's going side to side and up and down which just looks a little bit less, I mean just frankly is less smooth looking and makes the movement a little bit less clear. So it's kind of diluted a little bit sloppy.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

It looks like maybe it eases off a little bit and maybe the heel hook was the the hardest section of the route. But throughout the rest of it he does a good job going right hand on, left foot on. You know, getting getting up to the pose, bouncing out, really driving through his feet and moving up the wall with power and accuracy. So again he opts for the heel hook this time, but this time he really leans into it. So you can see in the starting position he places the heel on. You can see just how kind of low the knee is. And so he hasn't really engaged it yet. But in the next frame you'll see how far his knee moves over. So he really does a good job of rocking over this knee and really pulling through his heel hook. Instead of just placing it. So he really tensions it this time. So here you can see how he gets his pinch and really drives his hips into the wall as he raises his knee kind of up and to the left, really rocking over and being able to pull through this foothold.

We aren't able to see his neck here. This also is exacerbated by him looking downward and tilting his head down, but he can be taller in his verticality and stand longer, especially because he is a tall man, but he would be able to do that better if he pressed down his shoulders so that he could be higher in his height. The dancer is not on rhythm as he is clapping his arms and moving backwards. He should be on the downbeat, either every even count or every odd count, but each of his claps on movements backwards should be equally spaced from each other with the music. Instead, he is not at all dancing on the beat of the music. He's dancing pretty independently, so his musicality is not very present here. The dancer looks downward here when he should be looking outward, especially so that his head is straight on his spine. Right now his neck is tilted at an angle. The dancer's arms are a bit awkward. He's sometimes holding them as if he's dancing with a partner. He doesn't always do this consistently. Because there's no partner there, he doesn't need to be doing this with his arms. It's just making him look more stiff and more awkward. He'd be better off embodying his arms as part of his movement, adding it into his dancing, solely focused on his body, not an invisible and pretend additional body. The dancers movements aren't very clear when he's turning from facing one side of the room to the other side of the room. He doesn't always turn his full body around each way. And this is really should be spirit spearheaded from his eyes, wherever his eyes look is where his body will follow. So if his eyes doesn't don't if his eyes don't turn on, he doesn't fully turn his head to whatever direction he's trying to change the movement into, the rest of his body is not going to actually reach there. So he really needs to work on his focus and his directionality here. The dancers arms are basically moving independently from his spine whenever he's clapping his arms in front of him It just seems like his arms are In and of themselves. It's that his arms are actually extensions of his back or should be extensions of his back and his spine So he needs to coordinate his arms also with his spine and movement so that they aren't just Thrown out right in front of him and not a part of the rest of his body The dancer is not extending his legs fully. His legs should go into a straight line. They remain a bit bent. He needs to extend his legs further out away from his body. The dancers hands are a bit awkward here We see that his thumb is pointing outward as if he is holding his hand in a thumbs up. That's just tension gathering in his arms He should relax his arms and he should be using his arms dancing not just held in with this thumbs up position The dancer is flat-footed with his feet flat on the ground. Really, he should be on his toes and his heels should be off the ground so he could be maneuvering more easily and be lighter on his feet. The dancer made a mistake in the sequence here. He's been doing kick, kick, double kick, or right, left, right, right, and then repeating that left, right, left, left. And in this very last series, he should have ended it with a double kick on the same leg, but instead he did a single kick on each leg. So he lost the pattern or the sequencing here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So the kicker's target area is this side of the goal here, right? That's where he wants to get the ball to, away from the goalkeeper. He just put the ball down with his hands, took his walk back to be able to create steps to run into the ball to go strike it. So that's fine. Nothing's changed there. What you can see, the difference is with the last step that he takes in. His plant foot is next to the ball, but instead of his toe being more facing this direction here with the last step, he's landing and his toe is facing more this direction here, which will naturally allow then his hip as he strikes it to come around the ball when he makes contact. And then when he follows through on the ball, if he follows through correctly, it would go in the direction that he wants to go. So from a setup perspective, that's what we're looking for. The technique that you can see that he's using again is a short backlift. And this is what I mean by that. It's not super high up here. It's not like he's extending his leg super far back to take a big kick. He just needs to generate enough power for it to go seven yards at this point and into the corner that he wants to go. So you can see that he's angling his foot and his ankle to use the inside of the foot technique for this strike, which is appropriate given the distance. So that's the technique that we're looking for. And that's the technique that we're going to be using for this next technique. So we're going to be using the technique that we're going to be using for this next technique. And that's the technique that we're going to be using for this next technique. So we're going to be using the technique that we're going to be using for this next technique. And that's the technique that we're going to be using for this next technique. So we're going to be using the technique that we're going to be using for this next technique. And that's the technique that we're going to be using for this next technique. So we're going to be using the technique that we're going to be using for this next technique. And that's the technique that we're going to be using for this next technique. This is the moment of contact with the technique that he's using. So you can see it's an inside of the foot technique from close range. That's makes a lot of sense because it gives the ball or has a lot of control over the direction of where the ball goes. So he's setting it up essentially with his plant foot next to the ball prior to the moment of impact, a short backswing. So it's not a big backswing. He's not bringing his foot all the way up here. This is a short back lift this way and then brings it forward this way. So it's a quick action, almost like a snapshot here. He's slightly leaning back in this body, which is okay because he's contacting the ball just below the center line of it. So the ball won't sky here. He's not getting underneath the ball. He's actually okay. At the moment of when he contacted the ball, he's just slightly leaning back. So the ball will lift a little bit here. It won't stay on the ground. If he wanted to hit the ball completely on the ground the entire way, then we need to be a little bit more upright or leaning over the ball and following through and landing on his kicking foot. So here he's stopping, kicking the ball with the inside of his foot and he, his momentum won't take him forward. The follow through at this point will be really important to give the ball the direction that he wants to go. So a good picture of this technique and he's showing good balance and coordination with his run up, with how he plants his foot and then initiates the kicking action in an efficient way. Paying attention to his follow through here, so he just kicked the ball using an advanced technique of slightly more laces than inside of the foot, because at the last second, he was trying to turn his foot a little bit more this way, use a short back lift, and then bring the ball, bring his leg swing more around like this. And you can see it in the follow through, because if this is the center of his body here, his right foot as he follows through is going across his body this direction here, but it's also helping give direction of the ball. You can sort of see where the ball is heading to into the side netting, which is ideal. We would want the ball to go there. So a lot of this has to do then with the way in which he contacted the ball, slightly to the right of the center, and then his follow through is across his body like this. And it may look like he's contorted a little bit because he's twisted with his upper body this way, and he's bringing his other foot, his foot across this direction, but he's actually in quite good balance. He's just stopping, like he's not moving forward with his follow through here. And this is okay because he has a short run up and he has a quick back lift. He's generating enough power and force that he doesn't really need to follow through and run through the ball. So to speak, he can stop short, but he is following through completely with his leg, which is really important if he's utilizing this technique from close range. This is the first part of the penalty kick where he sets it with his hands. This is important. Typically, it would be at the penalty spot, which is actually back here. Although this is a penalty kick, it's not a real penalty kick because of the location of where the ball is being kicked from inside the penalty box. I just want to make that really clear. The first portion of this is the player would get the ball and use his hands to put it down on the spot where he wants to and then back up from there to take his run-ups and then go kick the ball. So from the first standpoint, he's using his hand to stop the ball and put it where he wants to set it up for his kick. This is appropriate to start. This rep is interesting because his support foot is actually pointing this direction, so he'll have to compensate actually to get the ball over to this side of the goal with how he strikes it and where he strikes it on the ball. And his technique will change with this setup here actually. So what he's trying to do is at the last second, he's trying to actually change the direction of the ball with it actually looking like he'll probably hit the ball more this way. So in order to do that, you can see the angle of his foot has changed. It's more of a toe pointed down and he's striking the ball with more of the laces as opposed to the inside of the foot. And he's going to contact the ball slightly to the outside of the center, more to the right side, and just below the midline actually. So that's kind of where his contact point will be. And so then his follow-through will be more like this, there, and because of how he contacted it, it will force the ball to go that way. So he's able to efficiently make this correction at the last second. That's an advanced technique that players can use if they want to have deception of where they're going with their strike. This is the last part of the action here is you can see the follow through. So he's just run up to the ball. He's used a short back lift with his foot, this kicking foot, and it's a quick action in to strike the ball. He's using the inside of his foot, which is really clear. You can see the technique with a locked ankle here, contacting it with the inside of his foot here. His follow through is important here. He's not stopping. Once he contacts the ball, if he just stopped his foot in that position, then it wouldn't give it direction. He's actually guiding the ball in the direction that he wants to go by extending his leg through. So you can see where his kicking foot is ending up here. That's important. He is slightly leaning back again, so you can see the trajectory of the ball. It's already off the ground. It's going to continue to go in a trajectory up here, but the direction of where he wants to go is okay. He's going into the side netting in this area of the goal. That's perfectly fine here. The only other thing to point out is his plant foot. You can see here that it's at a slight angle. So it's here. We call this like your pointer foot, that if it was facing this way at the moment of impact, it would naturally pull his hips more in that direction. So because his plant foot's that way, you can see the angle of his hips are more open towards this space here. So that's good. Combining that with the rest of the technique, it's a good repetition, and he'll have a successful shot here. The second part of this action is he's now taking three, four steps backwards and is also at an angle. He's shooting directionally over to this side of the goal due to the goalkeeper being on this side of the goal here. So what he's doing is creating an angled run up to the ball, which will allow him to more efficiently kick the ball here. If he took a more straight lined approach running on, he would need to open up his hip at the last second to be able to hit that direction. So for where he wants to put the ball directionally, his angled run up makes a lot of sense. And he's giving himself three or four steps to move into the ball to create some momentum that he can generate power in his strike to put the ball where he wants to go.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And right now it's hanging on space towards the wall with the leg extended. This is to transfer the weight to the right foot being in place. the climber bringing the right hand into place he quickly had dropped the weight onto the grip and potentially because the climbers left hand wasn't applying sufficient pressure is slipping off from the hold. It is important the climber can be aware of his left hand grip while positioning the second grip to secure the move. In this case the climber could have potentially pushed down on the heel hook to keep himself close to the wall while making the hand placement and not dropping the weight early. Another way if the climber was to attempt this is to have another approach while making it over to the purple block. Immediately the climber looks away while still continuing to bring the left hand grip closer to the wall and this is so the climber can gain more surface of the palm over the hold since just holding with the fingertips would not be enough to sustain the grip. And he continues to pull down on his right hand as well as pushing on his left toe to gain height and that way release some of the pressure for the left hand grip so he can place it further. The climber was able to move the left hand over to the next hold. This one where the thumb is applied onto one side of the hold and the fingers onto the other side is called the pinch grip as the climber will have to create pressure by squeezing onto the hold and pulling it back. Once the climber secures the hand placement, he needs to move the feet in order to get himself positioned for the stance that he will need for the next move. Glasses down at the feet to perform a foot switch bringing the right toe to come into place to release the left foot. As the climber glances down at the next hold at reach is Because he will be performing a dynamic move and as we can see the climber had brought the left Toe to come into place where he was matching before With his left hand and right toe The climber performs a foot switch technique while holding on with his left hand that's called the jump off jump on where the climber jumps off the Right toe from its place to bring the left foot to jump on to the hold He keeps the arm to be on the outside of it And this is because the climber will need to release the left hand eventually after he secures the left toe placement At this moment we can see how the climber was able to secure the left hand grip by bringing the palm as far in as possible, placing the fingers above the hold and engages onto the thumb at the bottom of the block. This will help the climber on increasing not only contact against the hold but also gaining more power over the grip with the thumb being involved underneath. This is because the climber is pinching on the hold to clamp the grip, meaning like squeezing and in order to apply pressure the climber then pulls the hold away from the wall to transfer over the weight. Now the climber is bringing the right foot at a high foot placement by sending the heel over the jug where his right hand is placed. So the climber in order to make the placement of the heel, he will have to bring it into the wall and have it placed behind the edge of the hold. This type of foot placement is called the heel hook. The climber was able to make the next hold at reach, placing the hand open-handed where the fingers come into place above the hold and the thumb onto the side. This one the climber must apply a lot of friction in gripping power trying to close the grip or lean back in order to apply weight to the hand placement once came into contact. The climber must press on the fingertips forcefully to sustain the move. The climber in order to make the reach, we can see how in his body positioning he is bringing the left knee to be pointed down once it was pointed inwards. This was so that he can keep the left side of the body towards the wall when performing the reach. But also the knee drop was done because he was not able to apply sufficient surface of the left toe over the hold. So the climber needed to increase the contact of his left foot towards the hold by turning the foot in so he presses down onto the toe. And at the same time for the climber to gain height he had to drop the knee and pushing down onto the hold in order to gain height. For the right leg being extended this is called flagging out so the climber can gain stability and balance over the move and had thrown himself forcefully to bring his center of gravity to the right side as he is performing a lock move which is a pull up bringing the hand close to his chest and holding it tight in order for him to gain stability over the reach. The climber has performed a foot switch and has done this blindly while glancing over to the hole that reached. As we can see the climber releases the right foot from its place and has kept the right leg extended. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer the weight to the left foot in place. As we can see the climber wasn't able to place the left foot. Quite accurately he did perform a jump off jump on and has placed the very tip part of the toe towards the hole. So the climber must apply sufficient pressure and is bringing the left knee to come inwards. This is because the climber when performing the next move at reach he will be sending the left hand. As we can see he's preparing his left side to be turned towards the wall. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start where he places the hands on a larger hold for the right hand. This one is called a jug so the climber can easily wrap the hand above the lip of the hold and keeps the arm extended to make the transfer of weight easy. As for the left hand, the climber is placing the hand onto the side of the hold. This one is a jug that is upside down with a love loaf that sticks out. So the climber places the hand to wrap it around that corner area of the hold. Also, eventually if the climber was to gain height, he can hold this hold underneath his waist because the type of grip that he will be applying is called an undercling. So eventually the climber will have to maintain pressure by pulling the grip towards him and keep the elbow close to the core. As he is right now glancing down to position the feet, the climber right now is stepping on the mat and this is a step up start. Once the climber gets to apply the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing on the mat, then the climb will start. The climber, once releasing the left foot, presses it against the wall while keeping the left leg extended. This is so while engaging into the heel hook to pull himself in as to keep his hips square and bringing the center of gravity close to the wall. That way the climber then quickly was able to release the right hand and crosses it under the left hand grip. The climber must place the fingers to match over on the other side of the hold as there is only space to the left side, bringing it over to have the fingers have contact with the surface of the hold to create friction and then apply pressure immediately to sustain the grip. The clamber glance is done at the feet. This is because he is not feeling solid on his right toe placement. He just had performed. He performed a foot switch technique previously. It was called the jump off jump on. It's not accurate if it's done over a small hold. In this case, the hold is sort of medium size but it's slightly sloped and shallow. It can take a fair bit of energy and sometimes the placement coming into the hold is not the most accurate. The climber is bringing the left toe to come into match at the hold. This is to make sure he readjusts the right toe that just had come into place before releasing the left foot again to get himself positioned. The climber in releasing the right foot, he leaves it on space with the leg extended. This is called flagging out, so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. And has leaned back in order to transfer over the weight to the grips. In doing so, the climber brought the left hand to a match at the hold. Matching means when the climber brings both of the limbs onto the same hold. The climber brings the right foot at a high foot placement coming into a match where the left hand is Ideally the climber should be glancing down at the feet to secure the foot placement, but instead it goes by feel Bringing the right toe to come into place at the hold to be pressed down Against the hold as he continues to pull on his left hand grip to apply pressure and he does this to release the left foot from its place you", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

All right, and right here you can see that kind of awkward twist up with the third finger, or yeah, with the third finger, and the fourth finger was kind of tucked underneath. And so just really giving, by working hands alone, you can really isolate some of those fingerings. So, as I said at the beginning, it was really helpful for her to work hands alone. This is too difficult. And so, looking at the piece, I would actually isolate the left hand first so that she could really get that pulse, underlying pulse underneath what she's playing. And then I'd work in the right hand. Another thing that would be really helpful at this point is to just play... What key are we in? I think we're in D minor. And so, just to play that scale to really get it so that you know kind of what your key is in. I mean, it could be in B flat. I'm not sure because I can't see all of the notes. But it's either in D minor or B flat major. But just kind of looking at that, making sure you know where your key is so that you're not in a hurry. Like when you're sirening something that's too difficult and is beyond your playing ability, like there's no reason to slop your way through from beginning to end. Work on the chunk that you can manage and then go from there. And really focus on one measure at a time. Great, so I love this section where she is just working out that left hand Identifying the kind of that struggle area and continuing to work All right, and though, you know, you can sense her frustration just in her like in the way that she's pushing the keys Kind of with her expelled air and breath But this is exactly what she needs to do through this to work this out Okay, so the, although the notes are not, it's not going well to start out with. Through the camera angles, it's on, I'm unable to see what the posture and hand position is. However, I appreciate in her playing that she is isolating this and she is looking at just the right hand as she starts and kind of taking a look at that as to not get ahead of herself. All right, and through there do do do do do do do do She does have some incorrect rhythms and so we want to make sure that we have the Da da da da dee da da da da we have a quarter note right there And so we want to feel that lengthened in that pitch All right, so we are making a little bit of progress. I would not be in a big hurry, and I would just continue to work on that one measure at a time. I would still exclusively work hands alone at this point. Okay, so throughout this this piece seems to be much too hard for this pianist and so You know my recommendation would be to just start at the beginning and really just work one measure at a time So that you know, you don't have to play the entire thing at once. So looking at her hand position right here It's it is a good solid start and she wants to just keep working there", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He can seem longer and taller if he presses his shoulders instead downwards, so it would elongate his neck and give him some space between his chest and the end of his head. And in general his transitions of his footwork could be more fluid. He is executing the choreography so technically he is doing the right steps when he's opening and then stepping inward and then crossing that series of three steps that he does both to his right and his left. He's doing those steps correctly but it's very he's very particularly going open center cross open center cross and in general all of his steps could be much more fluid and bleed a bit more into each other and not be so robotic. The dancer is a bit heavy on his feet. He's stepping with quite a bit of force. He doesn't need to pick his feet up as high. He's really bending his knees and picking his knee up and in turn picking his foot up when he lifts it before he crosses over. And even when he lifts his feet when he's going to the side. It would be in his best interest to be lighter on his feet. The dancer is striking a final pose and position, but I do wish again he was not looking down, especially here with his arm placement. His arm is blocking his face, so we're not able to see his face because his arm is raised and his head is down. So it'd be better if his head was straight so that he can take pride in the dance, in completing this dance series that he just performed. I'd like to commend the dancer for having great energy. He is heavy on his feet, yes, but every step he's doing is with explosive energy. So every time he's tapping his foot forward and bouncing up and down in his spine, he's doing it with such great energy. And that's definitely a part of his dancing that he should keep. It's definitely an asset of his. Again, the dancer continues to look down and it's shrinking his spine. If he looked outward, he would remain taller and aligned in his verticality. The dancer's spine is a bit condensed, perhaps because he's leaning forward a little bit, but he can be less condensed and be taller in his verticality if he lifts up from his spine, from his coccyx bone, which is the end of his vertebrae, all the way upward so that he's just extended and standing up tall. That would help him. The dancer's movement can be less robotic, particularly if he uses his hips to help cushion and guide the movement. So it's not so much about his feet stepping in each direction, but his whole body engaging in each movement to each direction. He can be lighter on his feet by pushing his weight onto his toes and lifting his heels so that he's not stomping on the ground, but instead placing his feet particularly onto his toes. The dancer also is looking down sometimes thus far. We see that he sees the floor panel. That's also making him look a bit shrunken or condensed in his spine. So he can elongate his spine, also particularly his cervical spine, which is his neck, by looking straight ahead.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The dancer's arms and elbows are straight and so it looks very clean and the dancer rotates the head. If there was a little more release in the upper body with the head and so maybe the neck and the chest moved around with the head as well, it would look a little bit more fluid. So that is something that I would like to see. Dancer is showing a lot of great energy as they first step out on the right foot and the left foot and Raises the right arm and has the left arm straight out the dancer whips the head around Smiles shows that they are confident and really enjoying themselves and having a great time The turns for the dance are very accurate. Again, they are doing a great job spotting and whipping around and keeping the arms at a perpendicular angle to the body. No bending in the elbows, except for where the arms come around in the turn, but they are straight across essentially. And you do not see the elbows dropping is actually what I wanna say. So rather than the elbows dropping, even though they are shaped in a ball, shaped as if the dancer is holding a beach ball, the arms are all on the same level. The upper part of the arm is on the same level as the lower part of the arm where the elbow bends. The dancer uses their isolations very well. Their feet are for the most part facing front. They're very aware of where their placement is, where the directions of the room are, front, back, left, and right. The dancer is able to move very well because they are bended in the waist and in the knee and very connected to the floor.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This is the onion here. You are going to make horizontal cuts, vertical cuts, and then cuts from the other end. That will give you perfect little symmetrical squared cubes instead of this way where she is going to have pieces of all shapes and sizes. It seems to me that this is quite overcooked already. I believe it's going to be pretty brown on the other side, which you want to avoid at all times with eggs. You want them to be smooth. You don't want any sort of crust on them. I might have missed something but she only used one egg. It is very hard to make an omelette with one egg. It is usually at least two. This thing is going to be extremely dry in the middle. I can tell just by looking at it. Also I wish she would have cooked the veg in the middle. Cooked the veg and then put it in the middle. Sorry. The egg is going to cook way faster and it is going to leave raw chunks. There we go. She's going to want to crack that egg on a flat surface. If you hit it with something, it's going to push eggshells inside. These Thai chilies are really hot. I would say they need to be split down the middle. You have to take the seeds out and then maybe cut them in half, cut them in half again, and then dice. These whole as rounds can be way too spicy to be eaten as a chunk.

Alright, so here we have the climber with their left hand on this pinch and this is super smart beta because they have bypassed this green pinch.

I'm hoping that he moves the pot in a circular motion to make sure that the whole pan is lubricated nicely with the oil. See, if he would gather all those ingredients prior to starting everything and get everything in the workstation, he wouldn't have to be searching in the cooler looking for other ingredients. He should have all of that stuff out on the counter and ready to cook. And a nice base. He flipped that relatively easy. It's nice to see that he had enough patience to let that base come together. He needs to continue to be patient. If anything, just move the pot in a circular motion. But don't go moving it around with the spatula. Let that base form. You can also move the pen in a circular motion just to fill in this little gap over here to form a better base. I like the fact that he's being patient and allowing the base to form. Before he starts to crack this egg, I would like to see him get his pot on the stove and start bringing it up to temp. By the time he's finished doing that with the egg and whatever veggies he's putting in the omelet, the fry will be ready and he can go back to the frying pan with the egg mixture. Nice, this is what I was looking for. That way, it's going to prevent the element from sticking and the paint is going to be totally lubricated. He still doesn't have a pot out there getting hot yet. He's going in, doing all this stuff, mixing everything in, and he doesn't have his frying pan under the heat yet. Yeah, it's fairly decent finger placement with the knife.

I do like that he's jumping up in this movement and I think if he would have done that earlier it just would have made the movement feel a little more connected to the style of dance. So really good job keeping that nice bounce in this part. So I'm not quite sure what the choreography was supposed to be. It felt a little bit all over the place. So I think just if he were on the music I think that would have just made it feel a bit cleaner and better for the steps that he just took. So being on the music definitely helps a lot, especially when the movements aren't really like clear in design. So here he's adding a little a small jump to the cross over and I think if he would have just you know make that a little bit bigger really nice knee bend in the cross but don't be afraid to kind of add a little more hop to the beat into the step. So here he's almost doing kind of a quick step in a sense because his feet are moving pretty quickly to the music and I think it would just help him a lot if he went up on his toes because then and also bending your knees because that just kind of gives you the freedom to move a little bit faster. And in the twist, he's also doing a good job twisting his upper body and really moving those arms side to side opposite of the way his knees and feet are going. So here he's doing a little twist to move forward. He's doing a good job getting his knees nice and bent. He's finally up on his toes, so that's nice to help with the twist and just making it easier to twist your legs side to side, just because you have more of the leverage on your toes and less if your heels are down. So the dancers starting with just he's stepping his foot out right now he's stepping out his right foot and then it comes together by his left and then does like a double tap. I think he needs to be a little more clear and if his heel is touching the floor if if it's his toe and then being a little more lighter on his standing leg because right now it just feels really weighted and heavy in a song that should be a little more light. The final spin was actually nice, just a nice simple spin. He had his leg up and he spun around on his toe. I'll say overall this dancer really has to work on the timing and music because I definitely think it affects how he moves. So keeping the rhythm, especially for this style of dance, the music is there so definitely use it and let it kind of guide your full body. So here he's taking a kick with his right leg and doing a little step back and he's also clapping his hands in between. I know space-wise it may be a little difficult but I just think the the rhythm like he's clapping the correct rhythm is just not on the right timing of the music so that kind of throws it off a little bit but the traveling I think is good for this beginner choreography. So here he's doing a, he's stepping and then crossing back with his foot. I think maybe taking his foot and crossing up top on his toe instead of just putting his, the ball of his foot down. Maybe just make it a step and toe step instead of step ball again to add a little more lightness and bending those knees a little bit more. So here he's doing a little step crossing over and then rocking back and forth. Again I think he just needs to be a little bit lighter. Right now all of his steps are really flat to the floor so really using his full foot maybe getting up on his toes maybe bending the knees a little bit more and also using a bit of his upper body to lean forward and back.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The Mikan drill can be done with two different footworks. You can either step and jump off of one foot or you can step and jump off of two feet. On this one, he jumps off of one foot. Everything is perfectly correct. Ball is high and extended, left hand is up protecting the ball. Since he jumped off of one foot, we want this right knee as we jump to lift this right knee up towards your waist level for the layup. The only thing that is fundamentally incorrect with this layup attempt on this Mikan drill is the fact that he didn't get his knee up high on the jump to maximize his explosion when jumping off of the ground and trying to get as high into the air as he possibly can. You see the placement of the ball on the backboard. He hits the top left corner of the backboard, which is the perfect place for us to hit off of the backboard when we're shooting a layup from the left side of the floor. So this was excellent ball placement on the backboard for the layup. The player does a good job of getting that ball high and extended away from his body and his right hand. He also has his left hand up to protect the ball from this angle. You can see better. He has that left hand up to protect the ball away from a defender who may try to come this way across and contest the shot by the offensive player. By him having his hand up here, it protects the ball and it buys him just enough time to be able to release the ball before the defender can get in the way and try to contest the shot. You can see here, take a look at his wrist and his fingers. His fingers are spread nice and wide, allowing the ball to roll off his fingertips and he gives a slight flick, snap of the wrist. We call it a slight flick of the wrist or a slight snap of his wrist back towards the direction of the rim to get the ball to travel towards this top left corner of the backboard. He places the ball nicely hitting that top left corner of the basket for the ball to go onto the rim. But this hand right here is really good as far as fingers being, it's a really good demonstration of the fingers being nice and spread and we get that little flick of the wrist, snapping that wrist back towards the basket. As we come over to the right side, you see again he hits the top corner of the box, this time on the right side of the floor. So he hits the top right corner of the box. Again, excellent ball placement off the backboard for the layup. The player shows the correct footwork and technique for the mic and drill. As he catches the ball out of the net, he steps with his right foot and he's going to swing his left foot around to the opposite side to square himself up on the left side of the floor, putting himself in the perfect position for the left hand layup.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

There's a nice bend in the knee allowing for the dancer to be on the top, the tips of their feet to be able to move very clearly across the floor. The dancer does a great job of knowing when to extend the leg and keep the leg straight and when to bend the knee. And it is very dynamic with the movement, allowing the dancer to be able to move very quickly between the steps and to be very transitional. Very nice pivot turn bringing the leg to a 90 degree angle to turn around and to place the foot on the floor It allowed the dancer to have a nice stance before moving on to rotating the hips To the right from the right to the left right to the left", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So this was another just nice moment for her where she does a little half turn up on her toe. Right now her heel is off the floor. Her foot is in a really nice passe, so the foot is at the knee. And I wish she would have just kind of played off of her spins and movement, maybe moved around her or just did something a little extra as she's doing. So here, the female dancer starts to do a little toe heel dig and he starts to copy her movement and I think this would have been a nice time for them to connect with their hands since they're doing similar things. So here they restart their rock step triple step and he's better able to lead her. With her I would say her eyesight right now is looking kind of down in a sense. So I think it definitely should be looking up, preferably at his face to make that connection since they are partners and she wants to be engaged with what he's doing. And again, because he's the leader, she has to follow like looking into his eyes and kind of giving those non verbal cues of what to do and what's next. So out of the spin, she kind of tripped up over her feet. So I think trying to make that spin a bit smoother. And again, I think that comes from just trusting him. Because he's not quite sure what he's doing, then she's not able to really follow his lead. So in their stance right now, her left arm is on his shoulder, his right arm is at her waist, and then they are holding hands here. So again, because he's the lead, his hand is always going to be on his waist, and her hand is always going to be her shoulder, so they follow each other's steps as if they're a mirror towards each other. So here they did a better job at staying connected when he spun her around. So great job holding, keeping the hand held in that moment. So that was a better spin out. When she spun into his chest, she switched hands and grabbed his other hand and as you see right now, they are holding with her right arm and his left hand. And then here when she spins around and gets around, then he has to quickly grab her hand here and they never quite grab hands at this point. So he has to be able to connect with her hand just to pretty much catch her and keep her with him. So the dancers are starting and I'm gonna focus more on the dancer with the glasses on. They are starting with a bit of freestyle and just kind of following each other's movements. She's doing a really good job even though she's not technically the leader. I'm just kind of leading him through this freestyle moment and using a job just swinging her body and just using her full body in this time. So as she's doing the like kind of a kick step and then kind of a pas de bourree, so stepping three times back side front, as she comes over on this side to kick she loses her balance a little bit and I think it's just because she's kind of jumping and not really centered. So just making sure if you're gonna kick and change feet and change directions, try to keep your balance, keeping your body straight up and just kind of taking your time in that movement. So my only note with this is they do look really disconnected. So as a partnering, if they're still going to freestyle, maybe still kind of keep some of the same energy. She's a bit more up and down with the jumps and spins, and he's a little more mellow just rocking side to side. So maybe just thinking better how they can connect. And then I would say even in the freestyle moment, just still kind of coming back, grabbing hands, spinning around, and then separating again as you kind of freestyle to keep that partner connection. So in this spin here, they actually let go hands, so definitely try to hold on to the hand as long as possible in that spin, and then you release right after she spins fully around. So the dancers started doing a rock step, triple step. And when they step back, they step back with their left foot. He stepped back with his left, she stepped back with her right. And then doing a triple step side to side together. And right now he is starting to spin her around. So taking that one, his left hand up, her right arm up, keeping their hands clasped together and spinning her around. And with her swaying, I really like to use it for arms, just because they are really just free-flowing, and then moving with the flow of her body.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

However, in this moment where she shimmies her shoulders, she does shine a little bit here. She's able to connect this upper body movement with the music. She's got a nice bend in her knees, and her pelvis is slightly dropped back, so she's a bit more grounded in her movement here as well, which is helping her with her range of motion and ability to stay connected to the music. As the dancer begins with a basic salsa step, right off the bat she's struggling to connect to the music rhythmically and also keep up with the tempo of the music. She might benefit from bending her knees, dropping her pelvis back, and overall being more grounded in her movement, as well as loosening up in her shoulders, her spine, and her pelvis to create some more possibilities for movement or increase her range of motion. As the dancer performs this ball change into a rocking motion of the upper body, she's connecting to the music slightly through the ball change motion. However, she really loses her embodiment of the rhythm when she performs the rock here. She needs to bend her knees much more and drop her pelvis back more significantly to activate a greater range of motion in her pelvis and her torso overall. Here is the dancer transitioning from one step to another. She really struggles in this transition to connect the first movement phrase into this upcoming movement phrase. She performs this kind of bouncing step with her feet very close together under her pelvis. And overall really just connects from both the movement vocabulary and the rhythm here.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And the climber is able to go up right-handed and grab this crimp-like hold. Here we have this match on the start. The climber is wrapping deep into this hold with the right hand. They're able to get the meat of their palm and the right side of their hand into the usable surface. And there's this little ridge on this hold that shoots back towards the wall that you can kind of wrap with your hand and get on top of it. So pretty unique grip position, but a lot of people use this hold this way. And after matching this left hand here, the climber is able to lock it down and attempt to go up to this right hand. You see they're coming up just a little bit short. You'll notice that the flexion of the right heel is just like pretty low. Need to straighten out that toe, drive a little harder with it. That's going to give them enough reach to get into this jug here. They just don't have it for this attempt. They also could be coming up a little short because they're dragging their toe hook on this hold, which is super common for spray walls. You're not supposed to drag your toes on a spray wall. Just because this happens, you end up toe hooking something inanimate and it will just kill your momentum. Both of these things happening just result in the climber coming up short. Climber is able to get up into this left-hand Gaston jug here. Gaston is when the usable surface is facing towards the plumb line of the climber.

We have to make sure that ideally we control our plucking so that if we are plucking hard, we're always going straight down with our stroke and never up so that we don't have the string buzz against the fingerboard, against the fret bar, because we always want to have that clear tone. This is a great example of a nice balanced hand shape with finger independence. You can tell the thumb is in the middle of the back of the hand, which is excellent. You can see that even though the guitarist has to stretch out fingers one and four, the middle two fingers are able to stay relaxed, curved, and right where they would naturally be in the hand. You notice that he's alternating frets with this one finger, his first finger, while holding this hand shape. So, that's a textbook example of how your left hand should work on the guitar. You can see here the guitarist is completely stretching out and flattening his hand. Ideally, we're going to want to change to a fingering where we can keep our hand in more of a rounded, less tense shape. Or if we do do this fingering, we want to shift to that and then maybe use a fingering where we can go from that shift to somewhere logical. We can hear a little bit of muting when the guitarist is doing this underneath his fourth finger. Because he has to stretch out so much, he's not going to be able to put a natural weight into the fret. So, ideally, we would want this to either be a change fingering or a shift so that he can keep the good hand shape, keep his mobility, and keep a good clarity of tone.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The follow through more so like a hook shot is not for this drill. You want to be able to power up and pop your wrist at the highest peak. So let's take a drill. The Mike and Ike should be performing all four foot versus two. Good stuff here consistently. As you can see, he did make pretty much the majority of his layups. Being able to hit the ball consistently in the right box, in the right area, without too much spin on it, gave him ample opportunities to make most of his layups. Now, this is better. Here we go. He's in rhythm now. He's able to make sure he's jumping off that right foot on the left side and jumping off that left foot on the right side.

So this in order to make the reach, the climber was at a low stance with the arms extended down below where the match was. And has swapped his feet to apply pressure, mostly transfer the weight on the right toe. The climber was squatted really low and this to allow the arm to be extended so that when the climber gets to engage the arms, he can pull himself in to make the reach while standing on the right foot. It's important the climber knows how to manage the body up for the extension because the chest will have to go in first to bring the arm at extension. As well, the hip needs to stay closed. Reason why, the climber has dropped the left foot and kept the leg extended. This to help the climber stay close to the wall to gain the most reach on the extension. here the reason why the climber sends over the right hand to the left side of the hold is and this is a crossover is because the climber will potentially need to free up the the right hand and position matters a lot as the climber will need to figure out how to feel stable. Well the top being his base of support and right now he's center of gravity is down below so the climber needs to be able to find a comfortable spot to engage into the pull and to fully rely on that right foot when making the next move Here we can see the climber making a full extension of the arms and this one so that the climber is able to bring the leg at a high stance. As we can see the type of holds that the climber is hanging on to, the grips are solid due to having a big lip where the climber is able to force pressure by holding tight onto the grips and mostly using the fingertips that are behind the lip of the hold. In this case the right hand is placed entirely in the inside including the thumb and the climber just needs to create pressure by leaning back on them. Now the foot placement that the climber is doing so is by bringing the heel in first and placing it behind the lip. This lip is big so the climber is able to secure it by not only doing the placement but also once performing the heel hook then would need to press against it to secure the heel so the heel would be eventually rolling behind that lip securing the foot and then the toe would be pointing towards the wall to even more secure that heel hook once the climber decides to fully rely on it once making the stance. We can see the climber missing the hold and not been able to apply the pressure that he needed to. So we can see how the climber was going for a hold that was positive, meaning that it was a jug easy to grab onto, but for some reason the climber wasn't able to apply sufficient pressure or do a reach where the fingers could wrap around it to do so. If the climber in this extension, he was able to make it possible, he would have to try to endure that left grip tighter to him and then pressing the left toe against the wall, this to keep his core engaged and tight while standing on the right foot to possibly make a slight bump up to it. That would potentially give him more length or probably looking away can also give him extra inches of length on the arm as when the climber gets to twist the head down, the shoulder will move up and that could potentially help the climber gaining more reach. In this case, the climber also could have failed from grabbing onto the hold because before going up for the reach, the climber was matching hold before and was quite for some time there, so it could be that the grip was at that time tired as well. Here we can see the climber adjusting the feet as releasing the heel hook. Releasing the heel hook can be tricky as they are powerful foot placements. So it's important that the climber hangs on tight to the grip above and also uses the left foot to press down to make a steady change of releasing the heel hook. In this time the climber is placing it as a toe placement on the same hold. Here the climber had glanced over down at the foot to make sure that there was more space down below to place the left foot to match. As the climber does this and gets into a position of a low squat, the climber then, after placing the left foot, quickly brings the left hand to a match on the same hold. The climber is doing this by trusting the grip and leaning back on it as the climber glances over for the next move. Here the climbers is starting at a sit start. Sit starts usually add to the grade as climber will have to bring his weight onto the limbs that are placed on the wall and it can add a grade of difficulty to the route. So in this case the climbers is starting at a one hold start where both of the hands are placed into the same hold. This is called matching and once the climber gets to press down on the feet then the climber will raise the hips. Once the climber is off the mat then the climber starts. here it was right that the climber made a placement to have the right hand onto the left side of that hole that the climber was matching. This is because keeping the left hand close to the climber was helping him with keeping a close pull up rather than being farther away. And the hand being on top, easy to release from the grip to make the next movement up. Another thing that the climber does well is that keeping the left leg on a flag which was before pointing out and that the opposite direction has now been brought down and then the climber has pressed the toe against the wall. This so that the climber can bring his hips towards the wall when making the stance on the high heel hook which the climber is able to roll in the toe on that heel hook and at the same time press back on that lip in order to engage into a close pull up and reach. Here the climber has let go of the left foot off the wall and ascending it on the opposite direction, folding behind the heel hook that's placed above. This helps the climber to transfer over the weight that was on the left foot to then fully be pressured and stabilized by the right foot since it's the one placed the highest. Now heel hooks are really strong as the climber is using the thigh to pull himself in so the heel hook is also a feeling of almost using a third hand and in that case the climber has two points of contact in order to send over the right hand to a match with the left hand. Here the climber has come off from the first start hold and has moved quickly to left hand up. In order for the climber to go with their hand up to that jog, first the climber had to press down on the left toe, this one being the highest placed, and brought the knee inwards towards the wall. This helps the climber to then raise the hips as he's performing the pull-up. As the right foot down below is pressing against the wall so that the climber is able to go out on the left direction. It helps with the support of the climber when gaining leverage for making that move out left.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He's got a nice slight bend in the knees with the pelvis slightly dropped back, which is keeping him grounded, and overall a pretty clear and appropriate incorporation of the arms. As the dancer performs his transitional step, moving around himself and locomoting through the space, he loses control of his right foot a little bit here. It kind of slides backwards into the space in a way that's unintentional and falls out of alignment with the movement technique. Overall, he might benefit here from grounding a bit more deeply, which would help him to be able to move more quickly and efficiently without losing his balance like he does here. But overall, if he were to just find a little bit more clarity in his footwork in these moments with a faster tempo, he would be able to move more quickly and efficiently with clarity. As the dancer begins his performance, he demonstrates that he has an understanding of the movement technique and is able to move through the choreography and sequence. He's got a lot of nice clarity happening in his feet, however he would really benefit from bending his knees, dropping his pelvis, and being more grounded in his movements. He's also got a fair amount of clarity in the positioning of his arms here, which helps him to just kind of be clear in his movement overall. But grounding would really help him to connect more deeply to the rhythm, which is what's missing here. As the dancer performs his ball change step where he's moving side to side, he would really benefit from maintaining the grounding that he had before, really dropping that pelvis back and bending the knees so that he can activate a greater range of motion in the pelvis. As he performs his ball change side to side, he's really only swinging the arms in front of him in kind of this pendulum motion, and behind him, and without engaging the upper body and the pelvis too much. If he were to ground more deeply, he would be able to increase this engagement, stay more connected to the rhythm, and overall embody the movement technique with more clarity. As the dancer performs a turn that locomotes through the space, similar to a chain\u00e9 turn, he's able to do so quickly and efficiently, particularly thanks to the spotting of his head. He's also got a really clear positioning of the arms as he's moving through this turn and a nice slight bend in the knees with the pelvis dropped slightly back, which is helping him to be grounded and stay connected to the rhythm in this moment. As the dancer performs some more complicated or more complex footwork, he's finding a lot of clarity continuing in the feet here, which demonstrates again that he's familiar with the movement technique and has an understanding of the vocabulary. He would benefit from loosening up his arms a little bit. He's incorporating them choreographically, but he's kind of lacking a flow between the arms, the shoulder blades, and the upper body in general. If he were to ground more deeply in his movement and really incorporate the upper body in a way that's more fluent and natural for this movement vocabulary, he would heighten his performance quality.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The climber quickly makes his choice as he is right now hanging on to an edge with the left hand which is not a very comfortable one and it seems like it's a shallow edge that the climber is barely pinching. In this instance the climber decides to shift over his weight totally on the left toe which is placed on a foot chip down below and to place more force to this the climber is staying low and does this by dropping the heel to create more force onto that foothold. Here we can see the climber is doing something differently this time where he decides to switch his right foot with his left foot that was before in placement. So that is a new change that the climber is doing when attempting going up for the last hold. Here we can see the climber chose to retract his hand and go back into the matching hold that he was holding on to before in the same way. The reason why was because when the climber had his left hand up on the highest hold, he had his right leg flagging out and wanted to transfer over the weight to the highest foot, this one wanting to place the heel in first to join onto a match with the right hand. So that heel was a little bit too high up and the climber was losing balance when making the placement. So the climber decided to drop the foot and instead had a slightly lost grip of the top hold and the green one and so the climber decided to just quickly let go of the heel driving his weight down and made the climber let go of the left hand and secure the grip to not let go of the wall back in match on that orange hold. So when the climber got to reach the top hold, he was completely extended, meaning the feet were down here below, and felt stuck. So the climber decided to let go of the feet, so he's cutting feet at this moment. And this he does by eventually taking momentum of the swing to bring his feet at a higher placement. Something the climber does well is taking advantage of the momentum where the climber does a slight pull up to make the match to the same jug where the left hand was and quickly presses down on that heel taking advantage that that heel placement has a still energy on especially on the pulling of the leg movement since the leg hasn't been quite engaged until he totally presses on it to transfer the weight over and is using the heel as it almost like a third hand so the heel is pushing down as he brings the knee over to the right side and at the same time the left hand is pushing down which helps the climber to smoothly make the transfer up to the next hold also we can see how the climber has send the left leg out and this is used for balance which is called flagging out and that's to let the hand the grip and heel hook take most of the engagement on pressure for the climber to then gain the reach Here at the climber we can see him leaning back as far as he can and this is so that he can extend his arms solely holding on to the grips above which both are jugs. Now the climber brings his right foot which was placed the lowest to a high stance and bringing the heel in first instead of the toe. This is because the climber is positioning the heel behind the edge that the climber is holding on to. Since he has enough space and also the climber is doing this to secure the foot and thinking about when releasing the hand how he's going to place that as his main support system. Again the climber has brought then from the swing and cut feet to be in a higher stance where he spreads his feet out for the stance. The left foot is staying on the foot chip down below and the right foot seems as it's going with the heel in first behind the edge of being a side pull kind of hold. This the climber will have to engage the heel forcefully while also hanging tight onto the right hand that's a big jug with a lip so that is a comfortable hold on hold to hold on to as a climber tries to adjust and reposition his left hand on that edge above. Here we can see the climber have swapped his feet by bringing the right foot out and the left foot into a higher position also closer to being underneath the grips that he was holding down before. Now that the climber got to reach the top hold he actually does this by not only standing up on the feet but it's important the climber makes a twist to have his torso be facing to the right in this case is supported by the foot not only being pushing down but the climbers also pushing against the wall this to support the hip twist as well as the left leg having the knee point out towards the right side and as we can see the climber is pulling himself in but also twist is his shoulder to help the climber gain height and gaining height is also helpful if the climber keeps the left side towards the wall Here the climber potentially was running out of grip strength, reason why he let go of the left hand. In this case the climber had a better stance before dropping the right foot, thinking that the right foot was going to help him keep low, it was actually making the left foot push him away from the wall. This because it was too much in a high stance and when the climber was trying to extend the leg it was actually pulling him out. The climber before had a better stance and probably having to work on opening up that hip of the left side might have helped the climber better to gain a stability when moving over to his left foot when transferring the weight over if it's making a stance of his hips over the foot. Here we can see the climber has opened up the stance in order to focus on the weight distribution down at the feet. It was important that the climber was positioned right so he can make the throw for the dynamic extension and aim direction. So on this one the climber has brought the left foot to be spread out onto a hold out left. This one pushing from the toe. The toe actually is making the climber pushing it down and out left while the right foot is the one that is pressing so that the climber can go directly up. Since the climber it needed to go slightly to the right side is the reason why it's important to the climber keep appropriate stance when making such a committed throw since he was coming from the match down below. Also keeping the hips close to the wall the climber brings the elbow as close as he can to his body while engaging on the pull up for the spring up to that hold. Here the climber has placed the right foot and has sent his leg to point the knee inwards, meaning pointing out left, and this to help the climber keep his right side close to the wall. As he does the pull up, he quickly lets go of the right hand to bring the right hand up to a match. This is a very small edge so it's important that the climber creates a lot of pressure onto those grips above. So leaning on the hold, meaning trying to press those fingertips on the top of that edge, is really important and the climber needs to do as static as he can, reason why he drops down to create more pressure. Also to avoid the climber from falling the wrong direction, he taps the left toe against the wall to keep himself going down in that direction and not to swing inwards into the wall as that would make him lose pressure. So he keeps the leg extended to push himself out. The climbers are starting at a sit start. Sit starts are usually difficult and add to the grade of the climb. This is because the climber will have to start from no pressure on the hands and the feet and would have to carry the climber's weight up to the grips by raising the hips. And then the climber will have to distribute the weight into the limbs, onto the wall. Once the climber gets himself off the mat, then the climb will start. Here the climber is solely relying on the grip above and decides to extend the arm. This is called the rest position because the arm is not engaged and only the grip is the one creating the pressure at this moment. We can see down below the climber decides to keep the left foot to help with the stability. At this point the climber has two points of contact. This means his base of support being the left side. He sends the right leg underneath, flagging in, so that the climber is able to stabilize him from swinging to the right. He presses the foot down against the wall to keep stable. The climber needs to drop his right arm down to shake his hand and his entire arm so that he can release any pressure build up that has been created on the arm. The climber before had it pretty tight up there on the orange hold before, especially when he was bringing his right heel up for a match. This time it was great of the climber to down climb so that he can endure the next moves if coming back to the wall. Here in this moment where the climber gets to pull himself and brought the left hand up to the next hold, this being a positive edge at the top, the climber is able to comfortably grip the top with the fingers being indented in behind the lip of the hold. He was actually forcing the pull and throw out left by pressing down on the right toe against the wall and not in any foot chips. It looks like the climber was also keeping the leg extended, slightly bended, but pressing really that toe against the wall which helps the climber drive force to keep the hips square and stay in position so that he doesn't get driven off the wall and help keep all of the weight of the climber onto that left toe. Here the climber has brought the left toe to join next to the heel hook which gives him a solid stance as he's squatting and keeping the weight down. This keeps his center of gravity close to the base of support down at the feet and he has quickly sent the left hand to join also on a match. Now since the climber has the arms extended this gives the climber a position of rest and the only engagement that is coming right now is from the grip as he's staying low. Whenever the climber is ready to make the next movement he'll probably make a pull up and change the stance in order to come out of this position. Here the climber has quickly make a foot placement to a very nice edge so the entire toe box is able to surface against that hold down at the foot and the climber is having a hard time to bring himself over to the wall. This is a number of reasons. First of all the holds are not the greatest and he needs to bring at least his elbows down and close to the wall but due to wanting to create extra grip for those holds above the climber has the elbows out and instead is really trying to step up on that left toe. It's really difficult of the climber to maintain this so in order to do that the climber must open up his hips so I would say to bring the hips close to the wall or potentially to help that would be placing the right foot back onto the wall while he needs to lower his stance in order to maintain the grips above. The left foot has left a hold and instead has been pointed out. This is called flagging out, which is only using it for balance. This, keeping the foot off the wall, helps the climber to transfer the weight over to the holds where he has his points of contact on, which is the heel hook at this moment and the right hand that has come into a match joining the left hand. So a match is when both hands are in the same hold or both limbs are in the same hold and brings the right hand over the left hand. Now it's important to know that the climber must keep the pressure on that heel hook and heel hooks are usually known to be really strong and they are a technical type of footwork. So in order to engage the heel hook, the climber is using it almost like a third hand where he presses it down and also slightly presses it, the heel, towards the edge to help with the pulling motion as the climber gains leverage. Here the climber has to step up on the left toe, this one being placed the highest of the feet and this can help the climber to distribute the weight for doing the quick pull up to move his left hand up to the next move.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So this undercling, if he pulls at all, he's not gonna be able to kind of get upper movement of it. He really has to shift his feet around and get higher feet. So he can kind of spring from his feet and kind of dead point up to this area. But he just isn't able to push through the feet. So maybe by twisting one of the knees in to get a little bit better balance or better positioning would be the key to this. But he just isn't able to transfer the weight. And I think he's trying to transfer his weight too fast to this left arm out of his right arm since it's like the higher hold. He's really gotta do a good job of first really gripping the right hand, getting into position. And then as he can stand up through it, transferring the weight to his left hand. We like to use this heel because this hole is really big and flat. It's a little bit higher. It's going to let him pull straight through the heel to pull himself up. It's going to toe down and shift his weight over that foot. It's going to let him transfer all that pulling power of his leg straight into the foothold. So he's not off to a bad start, but he kind of gets these things he, um, like he doesn't fully relax into this first move. He could get a little bit more over, um, which kind of let him lean back and help him set his heel up on this hold. So it's like he could just take it maybe 20% further into the positions and really own the positions. You can see just how much of pulling over it lets him just kind of like casually reach up to this higher hold and kind of maintain that position so that heel hook is a really good move. Whereas if he had to toe down, he'd have to kind of push to the hold and kind of perch on top of it. With the heel, he's able just to pull with his entire leg all the way through it. He's also doing a lot of pulling himself in. So right now you can see how bent his arms are as he's sitting on the same feet. So he's having to do a lot of readjusting. So it looks like he's maybe not comfortable with his angle or not fully comfortable in the positions. He's kind of trying to fight that.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So that's really going to let him pull down with his feet. Now let's take the place of a hand and notice with this heel hook he's utilizing a back leg which you can't really see it but that left leg is behind his right heel. So as he gets ready to move his left hand it kind of bounces out, helps him keep tension. Now he's getting ready to move his right hand so he gets opposite pose so he's got left hand on right foot on. But he could have just left his left foot on here and back-legged, bounced out, made this next move and saved himself a foot swap. and he tries to bump up to the next hole but it just does not work out and he falls off the wall. So he's starting off with kind of arms crossed. He's kind of moving up to the left. So he's kind of starting off with this like right hand, almost got a stone, but he's able to pull both hands. Once again, he's not really kind of utilized in the best position. So in this case, his knee is still face, kind of horizontal with the hold. So when he's pushing with his toe, he's almost had to pull down instead of being able to push his weight through his toe. So kind of bring this knee up and over, probably a good start to get his lower body in the right position. Or else instead, as he kind of moves to the left, his body, this foot's gonna kind of be pushing him right. So it's gonna be kind of at odds with what he's trying to do. So he's on this next hold, it's kind of like this kind of pinch undercling. So the positive edge is kind of towards the down and to the left. And so right now he's down to the right. So what he needs to do is keep all of his weight on this right arm, but now reposition his body so he can kind of pivot around and be on the upper right side of this hold. So he can pull through it, not have to fight it. Then as he makes the other move he swaps his feet back one more time instead of just backflagging. So we can see it, you know, as he gets his left hand hold, his lower body and his hips don't really move much, so he really is moving around with his upper body and torso more than kind of positioning himself with his lower body.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I'm making it going further towards the right side and then bringing it back further towards the left side. It's a greater range of motion. He can also make this step here bigger if he bends his knees more as he's finishing it So if he starts with straight legs, then as the movement is going down his spine He gradually bends his knees that too will make it look like will give the effect that the dance step was actually bigger Instead, the dancer should bend his knees more so he can have more mobility and twist his body further to the right side and then back to the left so that the step in general is bigger. The dancer can make his head movement have a greater range of motion by turning his neck further to the back wall so that it faces the back wall completely before he brings it back forward. The dancer can strike this final pose with more energy so when he brings his right arm up in the air he can bring it upward with more or taking more ownership of that step so that it's sharper when he does it especially since it's the last step of the dance routine he wants to finish strong so he should really take the care and meticulous nature to execute that step with full energy The dancer can make these jumps backwards bigger. He's taking up a small amount of space, but he can travel further backwards. The dancer is doing a good job of making his basic salsa shine here, or basic salsa dance step, spatially equidistant. So when he's traveling forward and when he's traveling backwards, they're the same length. He's traveling just as far forward as he is backwards, so that's really good. The dancer doesn't make the swing of his arms and bend of his body as large the second time as he when he does it in the first. The first time when he jumps to his left side he does this he executes it very well and the second time when he jumps to his right side his arms aren't swinging as far backwards as they could. Also he's not leaning his vertebrae forwards as far as he did the last time. The dancer can make this body roll that he just did down his vertebrae bigger if he opens his legs further apart so that his stance is wider.

Getting both hands wrapped around this hold actually makes it quite a bit more difficult because it's not a really positive hold. Ideally the climber should cross up and over with the right hand and that gives them more space on that hold and lets them just move past to the next position. So we see the climber begin the attempt shaking out their arms quite a bit while they gaze at the problem. Usually, that indicates some level of fatigue in the forearms and fingers and they're shaking it out trying to get fresh blood to come back into those muscles as well as drain some of the metabolic stuff that gets developed as climbers squeeze over and over. Good body tension and movement through these first two moves. The climber sets up well to make this big right hand move and they're able to keep the right foot pretty well posted there even as they grab. There's a little bit of body weight getting pulled away with the left foot, but they're able to tense up and bring it back in.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So it would be a good tip for her to hold her follow through until the ball hits, goes into the basket or hits the rim by her holding her follow through that will help her to ensure that she is actually snapping the wrist of her right hand and that her left hand, the guy hand is open and the palm is facing the direction of her release hand, which is her right hand. By doing that, that will help her to fight the urge of snapping the wrist of her left hand and only snapping the wrist of her right hand and getting that good follow through, creating that good backspin and that will allow her shot to be straight and be able to make more shots at a higher and consistent rate. We see here on the release, she's snapping her left wrist on the follow-through, even though as she loads up, the right hand is underneath of the ball. So she's a right-handed shooter, so this right hand should have the follow-through. And we shouldn't be able to see the back portion of her hand as she releases the ball. Because she's supposed to follow through with her right hand. As you can see, we can see the back portion of her right hand, but we can't see the back portion of her left hand, which is her guy hand. So she is placing the ball in her right hand to go up to shoot, but then as she goes to release, because her left hand is placed behind the ball on the release, she ends up snapping the wrist of her left hand, which is her guy hand. So the follow-through on the ball is with the wrong hand. We take a look at the shooter's footwork. She places her feet evenly so where her toes are even with each other. And this alignment of her feet makes her elbow point outward. Ideally, we would like to have the right foot slightly in front of the left foot. And the left foot is back. By having the right foot slightly in front of the left foot, this will allow her to naturally and comfortably have her elbow in more, closer to her body, and aligned perfectly with the front of the rim. And if we also take a look at her feet, her feet are right next to each other. So as she bends down, because her feet are right next to each other, her knees are over her toes as she bends down. In order for us to have better balance on the shot as we're going down, as we're bending down to load up the power to jump into the air for the shot, her feet should be separated so there's space in between her feet and her feet aren't touching side by side like they are on this shot attempt. Now if we go one frame past, now she follows through with her right hand. So as the ball leaves her hand, she actually follows through with her left hand first and then slightly after the follow through with her left hand, then she follows through with her right hand. So she ends up doing a follow through with both hands, but with the guide hand, her left hand first, and then a split second later, the follow through is with her right hand. So it is a two hand push shot, but most of the follow through is coming from her left hand instead of her right hand. So her follow through from her left hand is actually working against the follow through of her right hand. And with this action with her wrist and the follow through, it's going to be impossible for her to be consistent with her shot. So since the ball, she is a right handed shooter, we need this follow through with her right hand, and then her left hand, guide hand, has to stay straight up and down parallel with the palms open facing towards her right hand, which is her shooting hand. Let me take a look at the hand placement on the ball. Her right hand is underneath the ball as she's releasing the ball, which is a good position for her right hand to be in. You can see from this angle here that her hand is underneath the ball in a good position. Her left guy hand is on the back left portion of the ball. This left hand needs to be slid up higher and directly on the side of the ball. That way we're not shooting with our left hand. With this position of her left hand being behind the ball as she goes to release the ball, with that left hand in that position, it's the natural tendency to push the ball slightly with your left hand in addition to shooting the ball with her right hand. It becomes a two-hand shot. Now when it's a two-hand shot, the two hands are working against each other. It's hard to be consistent and get the ball into the exact same location every time we release the ball because we're shooting the ball with two hands and we want it to be a one-handed shot. This left hand needs to be moved up higher to this left side. It's a guy hand because the guy hand's job is only to hold the ball in place in the right hand. It is not a factor in the shot. As we begin the release, that left hand does not touch the ball or we have to move that left hand slightly off of the ball so it's a one-hand shot. The release and the follow-through is only with the right hand and not with our left hand.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Really wonderful job. The dancer does a really great job of using, incorporating their arms while doing this really rigorous footwork. I would encourage the dancer to think about releasing the tension that we see here in their fingertips at moments and thinking about where they're placing their hands, thinking about those really small, miniscule details takes it to the professional level for an intermediate salsa. Notice how the dancer uses their head so they look where they want to go and then their whole body spins really quickly to meet it. I've talked about this concept before called spotting. This allows them to turn really quickly and efficiently so great job at spotting here. Here, I would encourage the dancer to bend their knees or plie even further to have a greater range of motion for this hip action and knee action that we see where the knees go back and forth in kind of this motion. Here again I would highlight the attention to detail in the arms that they're doing a really great job of executing and also the sharpness of the arms that they're doing a really amazing job of executing as well because of their attention to detail. Here the dancer does a really great job of using their arms and having power and strength behind their arms, also engaging their core. I would encourage them to bend their knees to have greater range of motion. This movement is quite interesting and has like a loosey-goosey, kind of lethargic feeling to it. So I would encourage the dancer, since it's a dynamic quality change from this very upright gliding movement to this kind of lethargic, loosey-goosey, that they bend their knees even further and over-accentuate every part of this movement, really rocking their head back and forth to create this dynamic quality change in movement and express that this is a moment to let go. Here I would encourage the dancer when they do this body roll over here is to bend their knees even further and really bend down so they have this large range of motion to be able to move their hips in this huge circular motion. This would allow for more dynamic quality and a change from how they've been moving which is really fast and more upright to this bent position with this huge body roll. This would improve the dynamic quality and make it feel, the dance feel more connected to each other so one flow movement flows into the next movement flows into the next movement. I want to highlight this moment here. The dancer has a wonderful attention to detail. Look at the fingertips that is pointing in either direction. Look at the toes engaged on the ground. Look at that whole foot. Look at both knees being bent. This is a great attention to detail. The only thing that I would say to improve this movement is to lower this shoulder down so the arm cuts across space more that way. Overall, this is a great example of having that precision and attention to detail that allows what we call these photographic moments in dance. Wonderful job here.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So I think if he got his right hand here, you know, it's set him up to get his right foot up again, backflip, and then cross his left hand into here. But instead he tries to bump his hand up here and it's really off balance. It's really low. So I think if he's going to go, if he's going to skip this hold, doing the dyno is the best option or else he needs to go right hand and then make it more of a static thing.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She's hyper-extending her arms, where she's creating this really, really straight line through the elbow, which lacks any sort of clarity, specifically in movement dynamics. She's just kind of flicking that arm outwards as she's performing these steps, which is disconnecting her from the rhythm and making this transitional step appear awkward and disconnected from the music. Here the dancer is very successful in her transitional steps. She's creating really clear shapes with her arms and her hands as well as her lower body. As she's changing directions, her focus stays steady into the direction inappropriate for the movement that's happening. You can see here her gaze is slightly lowered, however it feels appropriate sitting on top of her spine in this more grounded bent movement. She's being clear in her direction, she's being clear in her shapes, which is keeping her connected to the rhythm and overall creating a transition that feels purposeful rather than awkward and rushed. In a step that she's shown that she has a pretty strong command over, which is just twisting through the ankles and the ball of the feet, with arm choreography performed on top, as she moves or travels it through the space backwards into the space, she loses this command. She doesn't twist as significantly in the feet or in the knees, which you can see her feet and her knees are quite tight together here, which is limiting her range of movement, and her arm choreography becomes more simple as her head becomes disconnected from her spine, which shows overall like a lack of command over this movement. As the dancer performs a series of twists in her lower body, she has this nice choreography that's happening in her upper body where the arms are really coming out from the side and meeting down the middle, which you can see in front of her over here. In this execution of the step, her upper body choreography is clear, her pelvis is engaged, and her lower body is clear as well, which is keeping her connected to the rhythm. However, this next portion of the transitional steps where she's moving through the space are more unclear than the steps prior. You can see this leg is coming out in front of her for kick, however her leg or her knee is bent quite significantly and her foot is just kind of dangling off the end here. Her spine appears a little stiff and her arm choreography becomes less strong and less definitive. Her head is slightly back which is creating a little bit of an awkward line from her head through her spine. Overall she's creating a lack of clarity here in both her direction, her facing, and her movement itself. The dancer performs this twist step with pretty expert execution as she's moving through the space, this time forward through the space. She's keeping a nice bend in her knees, she's fully twisting through her ankles, and she has this definitive arm choreography where the hands are punching down into the space. Here the dancer is performing a transitional step where she's sweeping through the space and kind of falling off balance quite a bit purposefully. However, she would benefit from a really larger movement, reaching these arms out from her even larger and more significantly swiping through the space and also pushing her pelvis more deeply out to the side, which would create more of an authentic falling feeling and letting that head fall in the opposite direction over this way, which would create a deeper line in her torso and again create a more genuine falling feeling that would heighten her performance quality. The dancer starts by performing the Charleston step where she's bringing one leg in front of her, twisting it behind, and then switching legs to move behind her. This is all happening right underneath herself, right underneath her pelvis. She's performing this step quite expertly. She's adding some embellishments in the lower body by twisting through her ankles into the ball of her feet, which is welcome here. It really does connect to the music and adds a heightened level of expertise to this movement. She does have clear command over it. And her upper body is performing clear choreography that matches and aligns with the lower body and with the aesthetic of the movement. She's connected quite clearly to the rhythm and appears to have a command over the movement in general during this step. So dancer's performing a series of grounded step touches. She's performing this step at a pretty intermediate execution. She does have a nice bend in her knees and she is staying tied to the music rhythmically. However, she would benefit from an even deeper bend in those knees, a dropping of the pelvis, a tilting of the upper body over that lower body slightly to create a more grounded feel, which would add a heightened sense of movement dynamic here and connect her even more deeply to the rhythm. Here the dancer appears quite unsure of what's happening. Her movement is quite unclear and disconnected from the rhythm. She isn't performing any sort of particular step or phrase work, so her upper body is performing a choreography that feels a bit sporadic and disconnected from the movement, as is her lower body. She's performing something in between a twist and step touch here. She isn't quite clear in her movement, which is disconnecting her from the rhythm and also causing her to create kind of a murky movement quality that's very one note. During the series of kickball changes, which I believe is supposed to emulate or be the fall off the log step, she again loses that connection to the rhythm just a little bit more than she had before. Her upper body choreography does get a bit weaker while her spine gets a little bit stiffer, as does her pelvis, and she's not performing the kicks fully in her lower body for this kickball change step, which is throwing her off the rhythm and showing she's a little bit unsure or underconfident in this moment. As the dancer is performing a kickball change, a box step, and a series of kind of gentle floating between her upper body and her pelvis, she still has a pretty strong command over the movement, though she disconnects from the music a little bit in this moment. Perhaps during this transitional step, that's not as repetitive as the prior step. She's struggling to continue into the next piece of choreography as well as stay connected to the rhythm.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So right now his right toe is touching the floor. His hands are also kind of mimicking his feet and just tapping, almost like he's tapping a drum. So that would be a good way to make a connection with the drums and the music and tapping your hand and your feet at the same time. So here he, like I said, he put a little personal touch. He added a little arm going around his head and as he crosses over, his knees are bent. Again, keeping his body fully straight forward so everything is square to the front. Just really nice, smooth transitions between each step. So here he is after his turn, he's able to stop himself with his legs crossed, his right foot crossed in front, his hands are in front of his body, and he's just kind of rocking his head back and forth to get into the groove, so really nice ending with this one. And overall I think this is an excellent example for the basic choreography. Just really great energy, a really good model of what to do for this choreography. So the dancer starts taking his steps in place. His feet are in parallel. He's picking his feet up. You notice his knees are, you know, coming up a bit about to here. He's rotating his arms and around. Just a really good energy to start off the dance. So really nice turns, really clean turns. He was able to transition between turning around forward to turning around backwards really well. And then he also has his hands up by his chest really nicely to help him turn. He was definitely spotting because when he got around, it was just a clean, smooth turn and he's able to face the front without any issues. So here he's doing the step forward and back except he's almost doing a little square. So when he stepped forward he kind of crossed his leg a bit in front and then stepped back so there's a slight box square that he's doing, which is fine, but just a really nice touch and just really good energy in his feet and keeping those arms moving around. And now he's progressed a step to the side. So again, picking that foot up really nicely off the floor, bending those knees, stepping out, his eyes are facing forward. Just a really good look from the jump.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I definitely think her energy could have increased just a little bit. It just starts to kind of fade away and because she's so exact on the beats, increasing that energy could definitely just make it look a lot better and just really connect with the music more. So here in the turn, she lost her balance a little bit and she went from this section to turning here and it should have just been a turn right in place. So that's just kind of a balance issue, just making sure she keeps in the same area and not spinning to travel, but spinning to stay in place. So here as she steps forward with the twist, definitely can stay on the balls of the feet in this part. The knees can be a bit straighter just because of the way she's twisting and making sure the twist is, if she's stepping forward with her right foot then her body is twisting to the left, stepping forward with the left foot then her body's twisting to the right to keep that twist correct. So up to here, nice job getting that right leg up and around, holding her balance, and then turning around, and then into this position. I think her legs can be opened out a little bit more, but the knees are bent correctly, and then she does a nice upper body roll with her shoulders. So here, really nice job just with this little groove moment. Her knees are bent, stepping outside to side, and she has a really nice flow throughout her body. So here she rolls the arms around. Definitely want to keep them straight all the way around until they drop down instead of cutting them off and they become a little short at the end. So here she takes just a small salsa step forward. Definitely could have made that bigger, so really stepping that foot out a little bit further out. And then when she moved her arms, she was just rotating the arms and not her shoulders. So you really want to get the full back and body into the roll. Even though it's just one step, it chills to incorporate the full body. So here from the beginning, the dancer starts off with a kick and then a twist with her legs, which was done well. She had her heels off the floor to be able to twist her body and then she stops in this position here where her left leg is crossed over her right. I definitely think the movement could have been one where she is up on her toes and really stops her body from stepping back with a little bit more energy because it feels a little low right now, but overall nice job opening up. So here when she steps out for this part, it would be great if the feet were in just parallel, more side-by-side instead of kind of slanted, so with this right foot a little bit forward, just because it's a very, she's only moving her head so she wants to have everything centered from the floor. So having both feet more in like a second position, a little space opened out, slightly bend the knees, but make sure they're on the same line together. So here with the footwork that she just did, she did a couple of squares around. Definitely could go up on the balls of the feet for that part. And then this next part, definitely bend the knees more and try to get this leg out so that way she can really scoop her left arm down and up a little bit lower. So here she had a nice job with this arm swinging around and then doing the footwork. Everything was done perfectly to the beat of the music as well.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

If the climber was to attempt this again, he needs to make sure he keeps the right foot being picked up so that the body can follow the direction of the throw. That way the climber also makes a more secure placement of the right hand coming onto the hold by applying the palm further in in order to gain a better grip and have more friction when surfacing the hold. It is key the climber continues to glance over at the hold that he will be making the hand placement to. And as we can see the climber had pushed forcefully onto his left foot placement, now coming out of contact with the hold. This was so that he was able to go out on the direction of the hold at reach and brings the right knee to come inwards. This is so he is able to bring his right side of the body close to the wall. Now that the climber's chest is at the same height as his grips, it is important he keeps the chest close to the wall. This is so when the climber starts gaining height on the flight, he remains underneath the hold at reach. The climbers starting at a two hand hold start where he places his hands at the bottom area of the hold. Due to the shape of the holds, these ones are called donuts and the climber is placing the fingers far in into the hole of the hold. And is able to create more pressure at the grip by engaging the thumbs over on the outside to squeeze the grip. Once the climber gets to secure the hand placements, he had sent the feet to come up into position and since he is no longer standing on the mat, then the climb has started. The climber was able to land the right hand over to the edge of the hold and as we can see he was able to jump on his right foot to boost the move coming out of contact immediately so the climber must secure the right hand placement before dropping the weight onto the grip. It is important that once the climber gets to secure the hands and feet placements, he then glances over at the hold at reach. This is called aiming and we'll need to focus on exactly what area of the edge of the hold he would like to send his hand to come into place. Now the climber is building momentum by swinging side to side. For when the climber is ready to jump, he will then jump over, swinging to the right side and pushed on the feet in order, mostly pushing on his left foot to gain direction to the hold at reach. And that is important that he bring his center of gravity as close to the wall to remain underneath the hold at reach.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She stumbled over the last few notes and kind of slowed down a little bit. I think partially that was due to the fact that her second finger is still continuing to raise unnecessarily. Right here she had to shift up to a different position and she didn't quite find it right away so you could hear her kind of slide around to find the home base pitch. But she eventually got to it. It did kind of disrupt the flow of the music however. When playing this etude, it is really important that the violinist focuses on placing the third finger here down with the second finger. And occasionally her second finger, like in this frame right here, is actually raised up above while the third finger is pressed. So ideally you would want the violinist to put both the second and the third finger down at the same time. And since her second finger is unnecessarily raising, it's creating extra work and it's a little bit of an inefficient left hand technique. Right here her pinky shifted up to the natural harmonic on the E string, which is like the halfway point between the bridge and the nut on the violin. This note here does not have to be pushed down all the way by the finger. It's just a very gentle touch that you can do. So this touch harmonic note can be difficult to locate sometimes, but she shifted up to it accurately and her pinky was in the right spot. She had the right amount of pressure with her pinky, so the note rang beautifully clear. As she's playing with her second finger here, her first finger is a little bit off of the fingerboard, so if she were to leave her first finger down, she would have a more consistent hand frame and she wouldn't have to put down that finger again. So there's just a very slight inefficiency in the left hand technique there. Her bow hold looks really good because her pinky is on top of the stick and the rest of her fingers are gently curved over as well. So when holding the bow you want to make sure that all of your fingers have a nice gentle curve to them with bent knuckles and no excess tension. Her hand looks really relaxed and very natural as if she was picking up a glass or something. That's what you want your bow hold to look like and that looks really good. There are many grace notes that she's playing in this musical excerpt. So very quick decorative notes that go above the note and then go back down. And so she's playing these with a nice lightness in her fingers, and you can really hear the decorative elements of those grace notes. And they sound really beautiful and they really decorate the melody in a nice way that really draws in the listener's attention. So that was very musically done to have that ornament there executed well. She's using really nice and full bow strokes going all the way from the frog to the frog right here to the tip And so since she's using making use of all of her bow She's spinning out a gorgeous violin tone getting a lot of sound out of the instruments As she's playing this musical excerpt, the same musical material keeps coming back, and there's not a ton of variety. It sounds a little bit dry and a little bit not super varied in the different approaches, so it would be nice to hear a little bit more musical contrast every time this theme comes back. She's now in this new position, but her whole hand is just slightly flat. It's just a slightly bit, a little bit too close to the nut of the instrument. So she needs to actually move her hand up just a tiny, tiny bit to the left there to get her hand frame to be a little bit higher in pitch so that it's in tune. Her right hand is bowing really smoothly and gorgeously. Her hand still is remaining very relaxed and her fingers and her bow hold are very flexible. So as she's playing these really long tones with her right hand, she's using a lot of really fast note changes with her left hand, which does require a bit of coordination and the sound and the tone is very smooth. Her first finger is raising a lot unintentionally, so if you watch her left hand, she could keep her fingers even closer to the fingerboard and not lift up fingers when she absolutely does not have to. This is a really tricky kind of finger twister etude, and it's very good for practicing finger independence and just making sure that those fingers stay down and stay nice and light to the touch. Which she's doing mostly a really good job of, but there's just a few inefficiencies with certain fingers being raised when they don't have to be raised. Her first finger slid down the fingerboard as her bow sped up. And this is a very expressive... This is a very expressive slide down, and she's bringing this out to kind of draw some attention to this part of the music. Very cool. Her bowing is very smooth and connected. As she changes between bows, you can't really hear too much of a stop between the notes, so she's keeping a consistent bow speed and keeping her hand nice and relaxed as she's changing between downbow and upbow. The sound is very, very legato and smooth. The last run of those notes was a little bit uneven, and that could be just an issue of coordination between the right hand and the left hand. As she finished the piece, her bow left the string on that last up bow and it gave it this really nice fast release which really shot out the sound into the room and it just had a really nice dramatic conclusion. Beautifully done. The violinist is holding the violin on their shoulder at about a 90 degree angle here, which is great. They have an aligned spine and they are standing nice and tall. So right away their position shows that they are ready to make a great sound on the violin. She's doing a really good job of keeping her fourth finger in tune right here. That last chord that she played sounded really in tune in contrast to the one before. Nicely done. Just now she played two up bows in a row, so that direction and then that direction, and there was a little bit of a space between the two notes, so that's what's called a hook bow. And so she did that really beautifully. It was actually more like a lurai bow, so there was just a little bit of separation between the two notes, but that demonstrated some really nice bow control, and she used her entire bow, and you could hear the separation between the notes. She's using her left hand to do vibrato, so she's moving her arm a little bit back and forth to get a little wiggly sound from her fingers, and it sounds really nice. It's very beautiful and very warm, and she's consistently applying it across several different notes as she plays. As she's playing the second, third, and fourth finger notes, her pointer finger is off the fingerboard a little bit, and I think it would help with the hand frame if she kept her first finger down when playing the rest of these notes. A few of the pitches that she's playing are just a little bit slightly flat, but it's very hard to notice. It's not perfectly in tune, but it's very, very close to being in tune. As she's shifting to a new position, her pinky accidentally caught the D-string there and actually plucked it by accident. So that's that little plucking sound that you're hearing. It's just an accidental pizzicato with the left hand. The violinist is bowing in this nice contact point here. So the bow is halfway between the bridge and the fingerboard, which creates an ideal violin tone.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

With more energy, more engagement, more enthusiasm. Dancer does not need to throw their head back, but probably what I would recommend is the dancer pressing their head into the chest on that layout. And again, bending in the knee is gonna give you the plane that the dancer is seeking. And then the leg is just shooting out from the center rather than the leg lifting. That is not the action that we want there. We want the dancer to bend the knee, lean back, and if the head is connected to the foot, then we'll just see that foot going out rather than the foot raising up. That slide to the floor, again, the dancer wants to press their pelvis forward, and then when they go to roll up, they want to undulate through the body to roll up to gain, come to a standing position, but to gain some momentum coming up and use the strength of the lower part of the body to push up. The dancer needs far more energy even though the movement is somewhat slow. Want to see more energy?", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She definitely knows the choreography. I just think she has to find a bit more control in her body because her energy is so high. You still want to have a level of control so the movements are still very clean and sharp throughout. So here when she jumps out side to side, nice space in her legs, knees are slightly bent, the arms are reaching back, stretching back behind her, and for this her hips kind of thrust forward a little bit as she jumps out side to side. And I'll say she's been doing a good job using her space because from the couple of counts before she was on this side of the room and she made it to this side really well, so just using the space nicely as well. So here her movements there, she's doing the correct steps, but it does feel a bit thrown around and a bit less control. So definitely want to try to breathe into the body to kind of relax a little bit so the movements are a little more controlled in the steps and not just so kind of out there. So there's a way to like have high energy but still want to control it so it still is structured and matches the music. So here in this position before she turns, she has a really nice cross over with her legs. I love that the arms are stretched out through the fingertips, eyes are forward, and the body is almost straight, maybe just a hair to the side, but for the most part, really nice job getting to this position because it does allow her to spin all the way around back to the front. So here, nice job twisting out this left leg, the heel is off the floor. She's sitting really well into this back leg, the right leg with the knee slightly bent and the foot flat on the floor, arms are stretched up and eyes are forward and she has a nice little lean position in her body as well. So here the dancer is stepping forward and back. She does a nice job just in the opening. She's moving her shoulders up and down a little bit and just taking the appropriate steps. Knees are nicely bent as she goes stepping forward and back. So here, really nice job with the body roll coming back. Could bend that front knee just a little bit, but the left leg looks good with the heel. I'm sorry, the right leg looks good with the heel off the floor. Then the arms are stretched up and the eyes are facing forward. So here with her arms as she spun around to get to this position here, again there was a moment where they were just kind of tossed out in the air and not really having a place. So definitely make sure you find that structure but once she lands here, really nice job, arms are stretched out to the side, eyes are forward, legs are crossed behind her. So good job controlling to get to that point but before just want to make sure everything has its place. So here when she crosses over, it does a really nice job getting the right leg crossed in front. So about here. So just showing the range in her ability to twist her body around and still keeping the eye contact forward. And also keeping her chest slightly forward as well.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So in this position the climber is hanging on with the right hand here and utilizing a high left heel hook in this position. So one of the good things about utilizing a heel hook in this position is by engaging with it and pulling with your heel, he is able to pull his body weight over by showing that his left knee is going over his left heel hook. So this does help to pull his body over in that direction. But what we can also see going on is the climber is engaging with his right arm in this position. So he is using a little bit of upper body strength in order to complete this movement here. So the only thing I would wish to see a little bit is that the climber would kind of straighten out his arms so that he is not utilizing the power in his arms as much because it is very important to conserve that energy. And being that this is the first move of the climb, this could be using up a little bit of energy to make it hard to complete the rest of the boulder. And so here we can see the climber was able to move his right hand up into this next position here I'm so in this move we do see that he is hanging on with the left hand here as well as Utilizing a right foot just underneath that So because he's using opposite points of contact with the wall this climber is able to put himself in what we call a back step position, um, so in this position it does Reinforce his legs being the main force of pushing him up on the wall And so what we can see going on is the climber is able to rotate his body So that the right side of his body is able to get closer to the wall I mean that's mainly because he's able to rotate his right knee over to the left and then on top that he is also utilizing a left flagging foot I'm one of the main reasons why this flagging foot is important Um is it because it helps to keep tension throughout the entire body and helps to keep a good Balance between all of his points. Um, so this is a really good thing to see But again, we can kind of see that the climber is incorporating a little bit of pulling while he's doing this move But that could just be to kind of help with that rotation of getting to the right side of his body closer to the wall", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The climber once pressing onto the feet she was able to lift her hips off the mat and Quickly the climber engages into a close pull up of her left hand grip to send the right hand over To the next holder reach now the right hand She is bringing it over to face the palm towards the top surface of the hold this one being a pyramid the climber is applying an open grip where she is creating friction between the skin and the surface of the hold and in order to apply Gripping pressure the climber hooks By sending the fingers over the edge of the hold In order to fold the hand and close the grip to create pressure to secure the grip The climbers are starting at a sit start and sit starts are known to add a grade of difficulty to the climb. This is because the climber will have to transfer over the weight to the hands and feet being in place onto the wall. Now the climber is sustaining to one hand hold placing both of the hands onto the lip of the hold. When both of the hands are in the same hold this is called matching and the climber is able to hold onto the lip as a jug because it curls in so the climber is able to place the fingertips inside of the hold. Now as we can see the climber is glancing down at the feet to bring the right foot to come into place. Once the climber lifts her body off the mat then the climb will start. If the climber was to attempt this move again, it's important that the climber places the hand over the grip and positions the body in the way that the grip wants to be pulled. And it's important that when sustaining a grip, each hand placement wants to be pulled at a certain direction. So by her keeping her right side close to the wall, she had dropped the right knee in to keep her right side close to the wall. It was not the most efficient way to bring the weight to the grip. As we can see the climber was struggling on making the right hand placement. This is because the climber eventually will need to drop the weight onto the hand placement. So the climber brings over the palm to face over to the side of the hold to wrap the fingers around the hold at this time. Here we can see the climber choosing to shift her feet positioning to come off at a wide stance where we can see the left foot is being in place where the right foot was going to come into place and instead places the right toe at a further foot chip.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The violinist is performing this exercise with great pitch and rhythmic accuracy. You can see again here they are maintaining proper left hand position. Their thumb is straight and the left hand fingers are curved over the fingerboard, which is helping them play their patterns with accuracy. Again, here the intonation and transition when shifting could be improved. Here there was the slightest bit of a screechy sound quality to one of the pitches. It would help to adjust the angle and weight of the bow here to get a more full sound on this particular pitch. Here the intonation was the slightest bit off. It would help to review this phrase note by note, possibly using a tuner and adjusting the finger's placement on the fingerboard ever so slightly to get the pitches a little bit more in tune here. The intonation on this particular pitch was a little off at first. The violinist then quickly adjusted their finger position to get this pitch more in tune. Here you can get a good view of the violinist's bow hold. You can see the fingers are curved and relaxed while gripping the bow. The violinist concluded their piece with a beautiful high pitch, nice vibrato, and a full sound quality. The violinist has been doing a good job during this phrase, adjusting the angle of the bow and distributing the weight evenly over the string that is needed for each patch when going back and forth and playing on different strings throughout this phrase. Throughout this piece the violinist has been playing with great rhythmic and pitch accuracy while maintaining a steady tempo or playing speed. Here the violinist is performing a turn or a style of ornamentation where you play the starting note followed by a rapid series of other notes and it helps to embellish the phrase and make it sound more musical. Here there was a bit of an issue when shifting. It would help to practice this section of the exercise multiple times at a slower tempo, working on the shift, watching the left hand fingers when shifting to work on shifting more smoothly and shifting with better intonation. Here the angle and weight of the bow is allowing the violinist to get a clearer sound when playing the higher pitches on this string. Here the angle of the bow that is being used to play the string closest to the floor is great as the violinist is getting a beautiful clear delicate sound on the highest of pitches that they are playing. Here the violinist's tone is a bit unclear, almost muted and slightly screechy. It would help to adjust the weight and angle of the bow here to get a more full, rich sound quality again. The violinist is playing legato or smooth and connected notes. They are using full bow strokes that are nice and fluid which is allowing them to produce a beautiful, rich, and full sound quality to their playing. Here the violinist concluded their piece with loud, full, and clear double stops. here an extra string was played by accident it could help to angle the ball a bit better to make sure that only one string and one pitch is being played here. The violinist is continuing to demonstrate a nice beautiful legato sound and excellent bowing technique throughout this passage. The violinist is doing a great job getting a fuller, louder dynamic level on their lower pitches, and then alternating to get a softer, more controlled and delicate dynamic level when playing their higher pitches in this phrase. Again here the weight of the bow could be adjusted to get a more rich sound quality. It's again a bit muted sounding. You can also see they are demonstrating proper left hand position as the left hand fingers are curved over the fingerboard and the thumb is straight. The violinist is doing a great job performing their ornamentation. They are maintaining proper left hand finger technique and position while moving back and forth rather quickly from finger to finger and note to note in this rapid series of pitches.

They should make sure that they play more on their fingertip and their palm a little bit wider so they have a stronger stance for their finger. The pianist is making a lot of mistakes. I think they're not so familiar with a lot of these scales. They should make sure that they just play them very slowly, so they get an idea of where their fingers are supposed to go. Again, the pianist chooses a reasonable tempo when they start, but as they're playing they start to speed up, which results in their mistakes. The pianist is trying to figure out the next notes. They should try to make sure that they practice their scales more frequently so that they're more familiar with the keyboard. Again, this is another example where they start to rush a little bit. They should just feel really grounded in their tempo and focus on the accuracy of playing the notes. Again, this is another example as they're getting further into the scale, especially this point, descending into the scale, that they're just speeding up. They should make sure that they practice with a metronome so that they have a very stable pulse. Again, this is another example that as they're playing, they're starting to rush a little bit, which is not helping them play more accurately. Again, the pianist is choosing to play scales at a tempo that's a little bit too fast for them. They're making mistakes, or they also start to test and play again notes that they've already played. It'd be best for them just to pick a tempo where they can play it straight through and very evenly. The pianist is playing with flatter fingers and their hands are a bit far away from the keyboard. They try to curve them and bring their hand a little bit closer to help their playing. If their fingers start to hit some of the other keys, it would be good for them just to practice one hand at a time playing this so they know exactly where their fingers should be going. The coordination and the balance in the hand is really off. You can see that these other fingers are a bit higher than the others. This is creating more tension in the hand. If they want to play with a more efficient hand, they can try to make sure that their finger and their whole hand is just very relaxed. You can see here, since they're playing with their pad of their finger and then playing hard that their first knuckle is caving in, if they were to play more with their fingertips they would have stronger fingers to be able to play the keys. As they're playing their scales, they're starting to rush a little bit.

And he made a few cuts lengthwise on his tomato and now he's turned it 45 degrees. Now he's using the flat side down and he's making cuts down into it consecutively from left to right. It is a barrel shape so you do need to make a flat side for any cuts you're making so that it doesn't roll away while you're trying to cut it. and holding that smaller piece he is attempting to peel that piece. It's very challenging to peel things that are this small. And now he has a peeler as well, a vegetable peeler. And now he's taken two halves of that, of those cuts, which I believe means he's got several layers in each half, and he's turned them flat side down, and now he's continuing to make cuts. He's kind of going on an extra level. He probably could have just cut it in half once and then use those flat sides to make his next cuts. I would recommend A, using more of the cucumber or peeling it with the cucumber whole and then cutting your piece off of the peeled section just because it gives you more leverage and you'll have more surface area to work with. he's completed his cucumber salad. I would prefer to have some salt in mine or some sort of an acid to balance the oil. It's typically more dressed when it has all those elements. This just may be what he's used to consuming. Now he's adding oil to the mixture as well. He's adding some freshly ground pepper to the salad. That'll give it a little bit of a heat, a bite. It's delicious when it's freshly ground. It doesn't lose anything because all the oils have just been activated in the crushing process. And you can see he has a little bit of trouble with it because the piece is so small and as he's removed that skin, the cucumber itself is wet. So that makes it just harder to hold. Please place it on the counter. He's grabbed a cucumber and a small tomato from the refrigerator. and is continuing to make cuts, which again will result in a dice. Now he's cut the end off of the tomato where the stem would attach. You don't want that in your food.

He's cut about a one inch circle off of his cucumber. Here he's gotten a small utility knife to cut his vegetables.

Not only in the arms that is helping the climber for the reach but it's also because the climber has continued to press the foot below being the one that is the only one in place. The climber was fully able to extend the leg and for the climber to not feel like they're going all about pressing that leg to gain height. It's also helped with balance with keeping the left leg on a drop but also driven into the wall to help keeping the climber close to the wall. The climber was able to fit the left hand onto the hold that he was matching and sends the right hand up. In order for doing this movement, the climber had to pull a close pull up again to his chest while throwing himself over right side for the reach. Now something that the climber did before going up for the reach was that he had swapped his feet to keep more pressure onto the right foot this time and let go of the left foot keeping the leg extended to help with balance. Now the climber by letting the leg be extended helps the climber to keep more force and more pressure holding all of the weight of the climber on the right foot. This the climber does by keeping the leg extended which is because of the foot being placed slightly on that angle it can throw the climber out left. The reason why the climber had to engage into a forceful pull up and throwing himself right in order to gain the reach to the higher hold. Here we can see the climber performing a paddle of the foot going forward and at the same time bringing the toe inwards onto the hold being readjusted in the moment that the climber was almost peeling off the wall. In this case the climber did hold on tight to the grips to avoid swinging out completely and as you can see he's engaging onto a pull up to bring himself forward in the direction that he needs to gain force to keep position of the foot. Here the climber has swept his feet, now this time keeping the left foot engaged onto the wall. This is going to be the one creating pressure, also keeps the climber close to the area or direction of movement. Now the climber has extended the right leg, this support with the balance as the climber was bringing the left arm up. As we can see the climber is keeping himself from falling all the way to the left by engaging the arm, keeping the pull up so that the climber doesn't fall out completely and is pressing down on the left foot to gain leverage. Also having the leg flagged out will help the climber to help with the twist of the body to keep the left side of the body close to the wall as it would support with the reach. Here the climbers is starting at a two hold start meaning that each hand has its separate holds and they are jugs meaning that there are positive grips. He can then lay back keeping the arms extended and trusting the grips above. Giving it enough pressure not engaging the arms saves the climbers energy so that when the climber needs to commit for the next move he can do a pull up to the next hold. Down below the climber is making a placement for the feet and the right foot is on the foot chip while the left foot is down just pressing against the wall. This also counts as being on the wall. The climber then will have to rise the core being the hips area and once the core is against the wall and all the weight is transferred to all of the limbs then the climb will start. Here the climber has done a series of small little pull-ups to gain momentum when on the throw. Once sending the right hand up for the jog above, this one being a big lip, can secure the climber to bring the grip over to the side and quickly adjust it by coming to the middle of it to secure the grip. As we can see the climber then now it's making the movement down below to gain higher stance by moving the right foot. Here, the climber then was able to bring the right foot to a high stance. The toe box is right now has sufficient surface to be on the big hold down below. And the climber then once pressing down on the foot was able to release the left foot and this one is out on as a tail to guide the climber with balance. This one so that the climber is able to transfer all of the weight over to the highest foot. Once this foot was secured, the right foot and the climber sends over the left hand to a match. Now since the right foot was the one being placed it was obvious that the right hand that was down below needed to come up and does this by matching the hold above. Matching is when both hands are placed into the same hold. Since the climber had extended the right hand first, then was able to keep the weight onto one of the feet by sending the right leg down. This is just for the climber to keep himself close to the wall or not coming off onto a pendulum effect. So he needs to keep at least one of the limbs and to move comfortably and transitioning to the right, bringing the left hand over to match at the last hold. Then that will help the climber with direction once he lets go to apply the right pressure as the climber in order to create pressure must lean on the hold both. Once the climber gets to hold the hold for about three seconds then the climb is done and the climber has finished the climb. Here we can see how the climber lets go of the feet from the placement and brings the right foot to be onto place quickly. He does comfortably letting go and swinging out to the left side due to the great grips that the climber is holding on to. Here we can see the climber has brought the left foot into a match down below and has quickly sent over the left hand to match with the right hand. Now what brought him over to the right side was the climber hold on tightly to the right hand and created a pull up motion to send over the left hand to join the match. Now the climber is quickly looking over at the next hold being the end hold of the climb. It needs to do this quickly so that the climber doesn't get off balance due to being in a position where he could potentially be pivoting over in a loose balance. Here, the white powder that the climber is spreading on his hands is chalk, which will help the climber to absorb any sweat may be coming from the hands and also to gain a better grip when on the wall. Here the climbers brought the right foot into a match and this will help the climber distribute the weight down on the feet. Now while the climber is leaning back, you can see how the climber is already bringing the left hand above the right hand and this both are in a match. And right now he is figuring out the position to fit both hands onto the same hold. Here we can see the climber as trying to bring the left foot into a placement. The right foot has popped off and slipped out of the hold. This, the climber will have to continue to hold forcefully to the grips above to avoid the swing out and presses tightly onto the foothold to not miss the foot. And transferring the weight quickly onto the highest foot will help the climber gain hopefully stability. Here the climber has done a foot swap. Now this he does by extending the right leg and pointing it out. This is not in any foot chips and this only be used for balance. Also while the climber brings the foot away from the wall, it helps the climber to keep the hips close to the wall. Now the left foot is the one that is being supported a hundred percent with the push of the climber staying out left. Now the the climber is pushing against the hold and this is so that can throw the body out left and also the climber is extending the leg so that instead of pushing down it's just pushing away from the hold so it'll stay the climber on left side. What's helping the climbers leverage is the grip that he has on and bending of the arm which is the pull up as well as him forcing a twist of the shoulder going upwards is what helps the climber get the grip at the reach that the climber needs to do in order to get the hold both. Here we can see how it was ideal of the climber to keep the left hand on place and performing a close pull up, keeping it towards the chest while being down on the feet on the mat. There isn't a wide stance for this, so the climber had to bring his hips over to the left side and then quickly move the right hand to sustain the unbalance. Here we can see how the climber in the moment that was going for the higher hold has sent the right hand up and had knocked a little bit hold on the way on his knuckles but gets to place the hand to lock the move on the right side and quickly adjusts it to the middle part of the hold where the climber has a better grip. Now the climber had moved the right foot over and this one has a little bit of a distance from where the climber is right now positioned. This the climber will need then to make sure that both of the feet are positioned where it will help the climber gain reach for the next hand hold that will be going up left side. Here the climber glances over to make a better placement of the toe on the foot chip. It's important that the climber gets to locate the exact area on that small chip as the climber may have to pivot or roll over his foot when standing up on the direction that the climber needs to go to. This to avoid any foot slipping and also to make sure he's applying the right pressure when needed once the foot gets to move over along the foot chip. Now as we can see the climber once gets to stand up on that foothold and the climber will have to engage the arms creating more pressure in the grips once gets to do a pull-up position motion.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Due to the placement of the ball on the backboard here, we need a good amount of side spin on the ball and he was able to generate a good amount of side spin on the ball as he released it so once the ball hit the backboard in this spot, it was able to spin and drop down into the basket. As he makes the layup and he catches the ball out of the net, he allows the ball to drop down to his waist area. When we're doing the mic-in drill, we want to catch the ball out of the net and keep the ball elevated and nice and high around our upper chest, neck area and never allowing the ball to drop down to our waist area. Here he shows the proper footwork for a right hand layup in the Mike and drill by making sure that he jumps off of his left foot. On this layup attempt, he hits the top right corner of the square. And because of the angle of where he released the ball, he didn't need any side spin on the ball at all because of the placement and the angle with which he shot it. And he didn't use any side spin. So once the ball hit this top right corner of the square, it just went in nicely into the basket. As we jump and explode off this left foot, when we're doing the micing drill with the right hand, ideally we want to lift this right knee up to our waist area. As you can see, his right knee is really low, which is a sign that he is not giving maximum effort on the jump for the micing drill. When we do the micing drill, we want to make sure that we give maximum effort on the jump and we try to jump and reach our highest point and release the ball at the highest point. Here he shows the correct footwork when doing the Mike and drill for a left hand layup by jumping off of his right foot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So whenever we do a reverse layup, we want to make sure that the ball hits the backboard first and then is able to bounce into the basket. When we do a reverse layup and the ball hits this portion of the rim, it's very difficult to be able to make that layup at a high percentage. The positioning of her hand on the ball is really good. With her hand in this position, she will be able to create a side spin on the ball when she releases the ball by snapping her wrist. The placement of the ball on the backboard, you can see, is outside the right portion of the square. So, in order for the ball to go into the basket, a good amount of side spin is needed on the ball. So, it will spin off of the backboard and go in this direction and into the basket. However, since the shooter did not create any side spin on the ball when she released it, the ball hit the backboard and came back off and we missed the layup. The player, she demonstrates the proper footwork and jumping mechanics for doing a right hand reverse layup while jumping off of one foot. And as you can see, she makes sure that she jumps off of her left foot to shoot the layup with her right hand. She also does a good job of raising, lifting up her knee when she jumps to the level of her waist. Doing so will allow her to jump to her maximum capabilities and thus release the ball at the highest possible point for the layup. Under the release of the ball, you can see that her hand is still open and straight as she didn't snap her wrist back in this direction. So since she didn't snap her wrist down in this direction, there was no side spin created on the ball. On the release of the ball, you can see her hand, she did not snap her wrist back in this direction to create side spin on the ball. So on this layup attempt, side spin was not created on the ball as she released the ball from her fingertips. When we do reverse layup and when our hand is in the right position, we want to snap our wrist and create the proper side spin necessary for the ball to spin off of the backboard and go into the basket. Looking at the placement of her hand on the ball, you see her hand, she does a good job extending the ball out in her right hand, keeping the ball, extending the ball out high and away from her body. So doing so will allow for her to release the ball away from the defender. Can't really see from this angle, but we would also like to have her left hand or left arm up to protect the ball. So the defense, they try to come across and contest the shot at this angle. They won't be able to because her arm will be in the way.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

By moving the back, again, it creates this more dynamic quality as opposed to the arms feeling like they're moving kind of like bicycle pedals. That was a fabulous turn. I think that they can even make it tighter by making sure that they really snap that head around quickly. I would encourage a dancer to have more power and strength throughout their movement and really spot where they're going because sometimes they kind of get lost in the sauce of directionality. Right here we're seeing some wonderful hip articulation and groundedness. I would love to see that throughout the entire dance and to see more hip articulation overall because that's such a good moment that creates such wonderful dynamic quality. I would encourage the dancer to be more grounded and really crunch those abs, especially when they're doing these circular arm motions or bringing their knees up to their elbows.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This right leg could be back a little bit further and as well as bending the right knee so that way she's kind of sitting into the leg as she body rolls and in the same way she did a really nice body roll in the beginning that could also happen here from the feet up but the arms look great and she's looking forward to the audience. So up to here, the dancer continues to do a great job, keeping with the music, keeping the beat, and getting all of the steps done correctly and technically correct. And here in this pose, her arm is raised up to the sky and she is also looking to the direction of her arm. She could definitely probably tilt her head up just a little bit to follow more of the hand, but overall, good job up to this point. So the dancer starts with a salsa step forward and back. She could definitely go up on her toes a little bit more as she steps, but she does a good job keeping to the beat, keeping her knees nice and bent, and then a nice rotation in her arms and shoulders. So, a really great job. I think just that jump was a time where the movement could have been a little bit bigger. But overall, really good job with this one, really good example for this advanced choreography. So here's one of the points where she could have exaggerated the jump a little bit more. I think making the jump a bit bigger across the floor and then also opening up her legs a bit more to help her jump and get much wider across the floor and then that will just help to really ground her body roll in this step. So here in the beginning, the dancer steps out on her right foot, twists her body really well, and then continues to step into this body roll. It's a really nice fluid body roll from her head down to her feet. Her knees are bent really well, and she just moved all throughout her chest as she was flowing through, so really nice job.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Start slower, use a metronome to keep this nice and consistent. With some open string notes hit by accident here, a student could just pay more attention to which strings are actually strumming for each chord. The left hand switches between chords very, very quickly and efficiently. A little unclean here coming down I would say the finger of the left hand could supply a little extra emphasis on the note when they're changing rather than sliding between the positions of the instrument. fingering also is perfect. Any kind of major or minor scale is going to start with that second finger and go from there. These patterns switch between a constant fourth finger, actually stays on a constant fourth finger while they switch between a second or a third finger to get that harmony. And that technique looks good here. This arpeggio example is a really great example of practicing that lower octave, but they could do that in the other arpeggios as well. I'd also advise that possibly playing this pattern as arpeggios, starting more on the backside of the position, rather than staying exclusively up here. This way you can get practice in both spots. The seating position is a little far back. This is a very relaxed position for this musician. A rock guitar stance here with the instrument on the side. Arpeggios tend to be too fast anyway, I would just play these much slower to be cleaner and more precise with the shifting. There's a very particular picking technique for playing scales down, up, down, down, up, down, down, up, and then up, down, up, up, down, up, up, down when going between the strings, and you can see that clearly in his hand. Really nice finger acquisition here on the left hand, staying very close to the string, getting a good sound, thumbs in a good position.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

That could get poked away from the defender easily. One thing though that I'll probably bump him up to a seven is he's got his eyes focused on the rim on the dribble He doesn't really look down ever.

You can't really rock over onto it So it's gonna push him away So then I deal II what he would do is toe in Shit that knee over. Let's go bring his hips over. I kind of let him go up to this hold a little bit more controlled He doesn't need both the feet on there. Anything is just making it harder. He could drop the left foot Let that left foot flag out kind of provide a counterbalance you know, so as he's Dealing the situation he hits this hold As he's almost in like This position So you can see the left side his arm has been right side his leg has been And then he's reaching straight armed at the right And then his left his left leg is kind of doing the opposite class flagon down. It's the left Can't provide a little bit more rigid position I let him kind of drive through his feet a little bit more just get into a better position And it's just a little detail but as he kind of reaches up off this foothold you see kind of twist his knee kind of down and I think kind of the better move would be to take this knee and Rotate up over this hold so you can toe straight down through it I would kind of bring his hips up and to the right And really set his weight onto his hips because right now it looks like he's really mainly just kind of towing in And kind of letting his hips get into like a not the worst position, but that's pretty much being pulled in by his left arm But by kind of shifting his weight all over this hold bring that knee to about Here that's gonna bring his hips so much further over. He's gonna be able to kind of sit on that hold and bounce out Here he's on two good holds and so instead of walking his feet through he kind of just cuts them and swings them around. While that's sustainable on big holds like this it's still gonna cost him energy but also as we kind of aim to improve and get better that's kind of just instilling bad habits on the wall. So you could clean that up and keep his feet on the wall and then just keep the tension walk his feet through. Here he does a little foot swap right here. He could have just done a backflag and save himself the energy of doing a hand-foot match. Then here, just kind of trying to more cleanly get that foot up. You can see he doesn't really cut his feet. He gets his toe on right as this bottom right foot kind of cuts out. You can see just how much that swings his body back. And that's just going to be so much more force on his hands and arms, kind of having to pull himself back in. So we can see as he attempts to make the next move, he's kind of just letting his body kind of relax and flop around on the wall. So kind of conserving that energy and kind of staying rigid and balanced. He's kind of just letting his feet dangling, drop around. And so he's kind of easing up on his core. We can see as he kind of reaches up, you know, he has nice opposite post, so right hand on, left foot. But as he reaches up with his left hand, you'll see his right foot's kind of just bunched up. And it's actually going to take more core to keep that in than if you were to kind of flag out and tension it into the wall. That would provide a little bit more support and help him reach up even better. Okay, so starting off here, he's got a nice wide stance, his arms are in two, so that's good. He's kind of sticking into his feet but he is kind of making this cross up to this big yellow hole. So I think, you know, right now it looks like he's kind of looks up where he can see it. He's got this right knee, it's kind of bending to the left. With this left hand so far up here to the left, it's going to be kind of hard to do a twist lock. This is where I think either if he's going to do this thing, he needs to get his left foot further out to grab a little bit bigger of a kind of base of support because you can kind of see when he goes for it. He kind of has to lunge the last half, it looks a little bit off balance or he could keep his knee kind of bent out to the right and stay a little bit more square and kind of push up and pull into this left arm. I think one of the two. If he wants to do, if he wants to twist this knee into the left like he is doing, he needs to get this left foot out here and make this kind of triangle between his hands a little bit wider. Just build as big as a base as possible. Here again, he's matched on this center hold. He's got his right foot on. So he has right hand, right foot, because he's gonna be reaching up with his left hand. And he does a little foot swap here. You'll notice he doesn't kind of finish the foot swap and bounce out. This is where he could have just probably kept the right foot on. Done a little back flag with the left. And then just reached up with his left hand for the next hold. And then when he does make up this left hand hold, go for this left hand hold up here, his right foot kind of kicks up and kind of has a decent amount of range to it. And so when it goes up, you know, it's going to pull his weight into the wall. But the moment it kind of drops back, it's going to pull his hips a little further from the wall and have to cause him to kind of pull in more with his arm. But besides that, he's doing a good job. He's staying opposite pose. So he's grabbing with his right hand, toeing in with his left, you know, reaching with his left hand, flagging with his right. He's not really keeping a lot of tension though. And so I think this is where we could see that right foot just get a little bit more rigid and provide some support. So you can see here, he kind of, on his arms about here, he seems nice and balanced, but to get the extra, you know, foot to the left, he's kind of almost got a lurch and it looks like he's off balance, which could be his left foot down here kind of picking off and losing tension because his feet are too close together.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She's able to engage the arms choreographically in a way that's meaningful, as well as embody the rhythm particularly in her feet while engaging her pelvis and her torso in a minimal but appropriate way. She would benefit from more movement in her pelvis and torso overall to help her with her movement dynamics and rhythmic embodiment, but overall here it seems like she has a basic understanding of the movement and in moments like this she appears confident and connected to the music. The dancer is able to perform the chaine movement, or this movement traveling from one side of the room to the other, with efficiency and clarity, particularly thanks to the spotting of her head and keeping her feet nice and close together directly under the pelvis. As she's holding this shape with her body, she's able to move through the space from one side to the other quickly, efficiently, and with clarity. As the dancer moves forwards and backwards in the space performing a fairly basic salsa step, she demonstrates that she has an understanding of the movement vocabulary and is able to incorporate choreography in both her arms as well as her legs. However, she would benefit from some additional movement in the pelvis, which would be increased by dropping that pelvis back and being more grounded in her movement and perhaps bending her knees a bit more. She also would benefit from some additional movement in the torso, perhaps in the shoulders, which at this moment are appearing quite stiff and disconnected from the rest of the body, which is holding back her possibilities for rhythmic embodiment. As the dancer performs this kind of circular gyrating motion with her shoulders, she has a nice bend in her knees though she would benefit from bending them even more and dropping that pelvis back to be more grounded in this moment. She would also benefit from increasing that range of motion in her shoulders and kind of loosening or freeing up her arms a bit to help her increase this range of motion. As the dancer performs this small jump, she struggles to stay connected to the music as well as perform it with technical integrity. As she's launching into this jump, she would benefit from bending these knees a bit more so that she's able to jump higher into the air. She would also benefit from utilizing her feet a bit more, which are a bit flat and not super engaged. She's not really rolling through her feet to get that height in the air. She's also twisting her shoulders over her pelvis in a way that's throwing her off balance and keeping her from being able to perform this kind of turning jump quickly and efficiently with technical integrity. As the dancer performs this really quick footwork into this fast kind of roll of the shoulders or upper body body roll, she struggles to move quickly while maintaining a connection to the rhythm as well as kind of a natural flow within her body. As she's performing this body roll of her shoulders, her shoulders appear quite stiff like she's not completing the movement fully and her arms are a bit oddly disengaged as she's performing this, which is making it harder for her to have that range of motion in her shoulders. And again, just as before, she would benefit from bending those knees more and dropping that pelvis back so that she's more grounded through her movement and able to move quickly, efficiently, and with clarity.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So paying attention to those details in the technique, even in basic choreography, allows them to complete it successfully. I stress this a lot, thinking about the connection, right? So this dancer is holding this other dancer too low. Really lifting that hand to be almost underneath the armpit is going to be super important because then you can use the other arm to push and pull and direct the dancer. At certain moments, it seems like they're off of the music, so really grounding one, using those hips and that torso, but also having an intricate understanding of the music and making sure you're embodying it the same way as your partner will help this partner dance and the overall look and feel of it. I would encourage the dancers to start off with a stronger frame by immediately lifting those elbows, so to create this kind of shape here. Again, I would encourage the dancer to move their arm up so that elbow could be lifted and they can guide them. I would encourage the dancers to think about the arms that aren't connected, right, in those moments, and having precision through those arms, because this choreography is so slow. The dancers are doing two completely different steps, where one is kind of swinging their weight on a pendulum and one is doing a step touch.

He still needs this relationship with his ankle to be a little bit better in terms of it needs to be locked and rather than just flat with his heel almost even or higher than his toe, he needs to lock it and point his toe up and his heel down, which will create a better passing surface. Again, he's still having trouble with some of his hips. You can see he's very narrow, whereas before he was pointed out and down. Now it's pointed again almost straight and he's not rotating as much as he needs to to get a proper balance. His striking surface is okay, but again we're looking for him to have a better heel-toe relationship in order to create a better strike surface with the inside of his foot. The last element we'll look at is his follow through. Because he's relatively tight in the hips, his follow throughs tend to be extremely short and he tends to plant with them right after. You can already see that he's passed and this leg is already planted down which means his follow through isn't doing what we want. We want your follow through to go through the ball towards the direction you're passing or shooting in. Here, he's using it to catch his balance and it's a relatively short follow through which means his actual pass or strike won't have very much power. you Again, we can see in terms of body alignment with his follow through, he's very off balance, he's kicking across himself, his planted foot wasn't set properly so now he's already above it and losing balance, and he's twisted and lost a lot of his power. Now he's using his follow through here to plant himself to stay on balance, thus his shot lacks power and accuracy. The key fix here would be to fix his setup, which will allow him to have better balance use his follow through to generate power on the ball rather than simply catch himself from falling over. In this one, he actually has a little bit better alignment with his toe and ankle. He's doing a better job of trying to fully create the surface that you need, which is the inside of the foot. Again, he can still rotate this ankle a little bit farther out. Another technical element that he's struggling with is he tends to drag his foot across the ground towards the ball, which makes him lose power and balance as he does it. To have a clean strike, he needs to raise his foot a little bit farther off the ground and strike in the middle of the ball, rather than drag his foot across the ground and strike below the ball. When looking at his body posture again, we see he's very, very upright. We want him to turn his passing hip a little bit farther, so this hip is pointed more out rather than so narrow and in. So turn his hip farther out, and we need this alignment with his knee to be better. We want his knee and hip to have a little more bend, so his hip goes lower, his knee bends a little bit farther, and the hip also rotates outward a little bit more when he's striking the ball rather than staying so central and stiff. In terms of consistency, again we see a change. This time his foot is lined up completely different with the ball. The distance has shrunk and again the same technical flaw that he has where his foot is pointed or his planted foot is pointed across his body which makes it difficult to be accurate. It's hard to have a consistent strike pattern when you consistently change how you line up and approach the ball in terms of where you plant and how you move towards it. Again, looking at his planted foot, he's very inconsistent with where he plants it. This time, it's much too far back from the ball for the strike he's using. His toe is pointed across the direction and his body isn't aligned with where he wants the ball to go. Here, he actually does a better job of having his hip a little bit further out and starting to have a better relationship of the hip and the knee. There's a little bit more bend. His hip is farther out. He needs to rotate this ankle a little bit farther. So again, his planet or his striking foot is a little bit more planted or pointed sideways and this ankle needs to be more locked. The last thing he needs is his heel and toe relationship to be better. Again, this ankle needs to be rotated so the foot's pointing a little bit further out this way, and then he needs his toe to be up and his heel to be down. However, what he does good here is that his hip is a little bit further out and there's a little more bend in his knee which allows him to turn his body and pass in the direction he wants. Again, we see some technical flaws in how he actually plans before the ball. Because he's so close to it and on top of it, it makes it hard for him to have proper body posture and alignment. Here again, we see that he's much too upright and he doesn't have good bend in his knees, which means his hips are very high and he's very off balance. This leg tends to be a little bit too straight, so it can't actually hold his body weight as he strikes. And because he's on top of the ball, his hips are very high and his leg for shooting can't align properly either. He needs more bend in his planted foot and he also needs to turn his hip farther when he's striking the ball with the inside of his foot. Again, we can see here he's used his follow through to plant immediately, which means he won't have much control of the accuracy and he'll lose power. He wants to follow through with this surface directly where he wants to go, rather than chop into the ground. This combined with the fact that he drags his foot towards the ball means he will have a strike that isn't very powerful and will immediately rise into the air. This follow through is slightly better as in the leg stays up longer and is going somewhat towards the direction he wants. You can see too though that his knee isn't bent properly and his ankle isn't locked. And because of this, his follow through is pointed up as in this surface is pointed towards the sky. Rather than this surface needs to be pointed towards the goal like this arrow shows. It will help with his accuracy and power. He's losing a lot of his power with his follow through. Now we'll look at his actual body posture. Again, we still see some technical flaws in where his planted foot is, which is his planted foot pointing across his body, and the distance and movement of his foot has again changed, which makes him inconsistent. Now looking at his actual body posture, you can see he's much too upright. His hands are in good position in terms of balancing himself out. However, through here, he's much too upright and too close to the ball, which makes it hard to have a technical stroke. He needs to lower his center of gravity so his hips are a little bit lower, and his hips and knees can align more properly with the ball. It's okay in this one, but again, he's relatively too high and pretty inconsistent with how he lines up. Again, we see here his follow through is relatively short, which isn't helping with his accuracy and he's using it to immediately rebalance. Because of the tightness or narrowness of his hips, he tends to use his follow through to replant and gain balance and it goes across his body, which will lead to inaccuracies with his strike. Here the player is working on striking the ball by repeatedly aiming for a target from the distance of about 10 to 12 yards away. They're currently using the instep to execute this action. Again, we can see his foot starting to drag across the ground as he goes to strike. This creates a movement where 1. He loses his power. 2. As he drags it across the ground, he strikes underneath the ball, which means no matter what, his pass will go up in the air and it will be much slower rather than a good strike towards the goal. This is because he's dragging from down to up. He's losing power, accuracy, and it's going to make the ball always rise slightly off the ground. Here again, in terms of creating the striking surface he wants, his heel is up and his toe is down, which is not the surface we're looking for. He also again is having trouble with his ankle rotation, so he's not striking the ball properly. He needs to rotate his ankles a little bit further so his toe is more facing outward. Lock and get his toe up with his heel down to create a better inside of the foot surface. This time, he actually does a better job of having his toe a little bit more pointed straight, but now rather than straight, it's pointed a little bit out and away from him rather than towards his planted foot. Again, we see a change of where and how he plants lined up to the ball. This time his toe is in decent position, which is lined up middle to the top of the ball. And this distance is probably a little too big, but it's okay. The problem is that it's very inconsistent in terms of he's using the same striking technique, but lining up differently to the ball each time. We can also see some of the problems with his follow-through in this image here. His foot is already pointing up rather than pointing towards the direction he wants. It's pointed towards the sky. We want his follow-through and his foot to remain down and strike towards where he wants to go, not directly up in the air. Again, his follow-through is making it so not only will the ball rise, it lacks power and direction, and usually this foot plants over on this side of the body, which leads to inaccuracies and unbalance in his strike. Here again we can see some inconsistencies with how he plants and lines up with the ball. This time the distance is greater where his toe actually lines up with the ball has drastically changed and again we see the same technical flaw that his planted foot toe is pointed across his body towards the leg he's shooting which makes it difficult to be accurate. The first thing we'll look at is his pre-striking movement in motion. The distance between his planted foot and the ball is pretty excellent and his alignment with where his toe is compared to the ball could be a little higher but is okay. His planted foot is pointed a little bit across, not straight. He wants to point his toe exactly where he wants the ball to go rather than pointing his toe across his body as he plans to shoot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

We also want the player to bring his ball placement position above his shoulders or towards his shoulders to allow more ball control and security going into the finish and also creating a closer gap of releasing the ball accurately towards the target point.

He's very athletic and can hang, get up, body square. There's that shooting hand behind the basketball. Arm bar stays up to help balance his movement. Again, see how he's moving. He's really working hard to get this angle. Very nicely done. Great footwork, great extension, lift, pulls that ball up, guide arm stays there on the left side of his body to balance himself, hold off a defender, eyes are on target. Nice look. Again, left foot take off, push, it also squares his hips and shoulders to the baseline, pulls that right knee up, lifts the ball up, may have his hand a little bit too much on the outside. Guide hand may have come off a second too early, but overall very nicely done. Again, really takes off early here. He's coming from way over here, uses one dribble. Plants maybe a little bit too soon. Maybe he needs two big dribbles, not sure. Um, but two hands on the ball, he's strong with it, steady, balanced, eyes up. He's really gonna have to really extend his body out to hit the mark here. He's gonna have to really extend his body out to hit the mark here. He's gonna have to really extend his body out to hit the mark here. He's gonna have to really extend his body out to hit the mark here.

He's gonna have to really extend his body out to hit the mark here. He's gonna have to really extend his body out to hit the mark here. Yeah, good lift, good extension here, lifting that shooting arm out, shooting him behind the basketball, there's his arm bar, there's a defender, he can hold that defender off with that arm. Nice job. Again, really, you may be taking off a little bit too soon here. He's really having to hang and stretch. And again, if that can happen, it can happen. But he might want to think about the spacing here on this left foot plant and push off. Maybe get a little bit in here where he has a little bit of better angle initially to go in and score. But he does a really good job of jumping, pushing, lifting, extending these hips, really stretching his shooting arm out here, his eyes and head are up. There's that guide hand comes off, stays up to help balance out the body. Here's this beautiful footwork, steps on this left foot, pulls the right knee and hip up. May have taken off a little bit early here, he really has to stretch it out, knowing he wants to hit the top of that backboard. But he's very lean and athletic here, nice stretching out. I think the guide arm is up here on the left to help balance out the body here. Again, takes off a little bit too early. Maybe he's taking off kind of in front of that rim. He might want to take off a little bit more here and really pull that right hip. But see the two hands, that left hand is either going on or coming off, and if it's, I think it's still on the ball here. So nice job. I love how he looks up. Being strong with the ball with two hands. Nice footwork here. Maybe taking off a little bit early. Again, a little better here, good foot takeoff. I love how he squares his body to the basket, to the baseline. Lifts that right knee, shooting hand behind the ball, that guide hand comes off as he prepares to shoot it. So really nice look here. Here's the lift. He gets there. Right leg up. Beautiful extension. Shooting hand behind the ball. Working really hard to get that angle here for that reverse layup. Again, big step here. See how he plants it really, really soon. And so he's got to really pull that right leg in. Two hands on the ball. He does a great job with that. He has a sense of how he's got to be strong with it. He's got to have it under control. Nice job. Again, his footwork really took off way too early. He's actually coming down while the ball's being shot up. So he was a little off in terms of footwork, the timing of shooting. So he's actually coming down while still trying to shoot the basketball. It's a little awkward position to be in. See how he's starting way over here? And you know, that's a long ways to go with one dribble. So he may think about starting his movement closer or adding maybe another dribble, two dribbles, to get this, because it's hard to get to the basket here in one dribble. And that might be why he's taking off here a little bit too soon. Love how he uses this one dribble move to set up the movement from left to right. I love that you can tell his eyes go down, his eyes need to stay up. You can see he kind of looks down at the floor here a little bit with this one dribble. So that would be a suggestion. You've got to not look at the ball when you dribble, ideally. You've got to know where you are at all times. Yeah, good take off, lift, lifting, shooting hand behind the ball, nice look here. See that? Arm bar up, square to the baseline or to the basket. Beautiful. Again, same thing here. Beautiful takeoff, pulling of the right hip and leg. Love how he extends the shooting arm, lifts that basketball up nice and high, head and eyes are up. Beautiful look at a right hand reverse layup. Yeah, really having to hang, may miss the mark here, again a little bit under the basket if you will. And that may just be his, he's having to travel so far from the liftoff and it might be that just that momentum is carrying him under the basket. But he does dribble it out in front of him. And then you get two steps here. I'd love for him to look up more. He's kind of looking down at the ball. So you can see his eyes. Got to have our eyes up. Got to be able to see the rim. If you drive in, you know, you might have a teammate here or here. You want to be able to have your eyes up and be able to kick it out to them. Like a pass. Eyes up. Yeah, here's the shot. Beautiful look. He ends up a little bit under the backboard as you can see. Tough to rebound a miss. You know, it's so important to keep, have body control on the landing so you're ready to make the next play. but does a great job of that one dribble, picks it up, puts two hands on it to put it in a strong position here as he makes his way to the right side of the basket. So he's strong, the ball's balanced, stable, as it came up off the floor prior to the shot.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He should be leading this turn on his toe, so it makes his spin, his revolution around less fluid. He could be more fluid if he puts his weight onto his toe. Again, now the dancer is looking directly down. We see that he sees his feet, which is even worse than seeing his hand. We see how condensed his spine really is. So instead the dancer's spine should actually be in a straight line. He can do that by looking forward to begin with and then also pulling up from the base of his spine to the top of his head all the way outward. The dancer is looking a bit down, which is making his vertebrae condensed. We see that he sees his hand in the camera view, which might happen, but his hand should be lower in the view. It shouldn't be mid-level in the view that he sees his hand, and that's because his head is tilted downward, and he's looking downward. And as a result of his cervical spine and his neck tilting downward like that, his whole spine is a bit condensed. So he needs to look straight outward, and in doing so, he can also pull up from his head, from the base of his spine up through his head, so that he's taller in space. The dancer doesn't have much of a neck here. His shoulder in particular, his right shoulder is high. His left shoulder also is a bit high. He can push down both shoulders. He can keep his arms in the position they are, just move his shoulders downward so that he can extend his head upward into space so that he has more of a neck and can be elongated and taller in his verticality. The dancer is not really using his space appropriately whenever he travels back He gets very close to this back wall yet. He still has Such a great amount of space in front of him to use So really he should be centered perhaps on this dot that we see in the screen so that he can travel Both forwards and backwards equidistantly, but right now he's uneven He is More so upstage which in dancing means towards the back of the room He's very close to the back of the room so he can't actually travel appropriately The dancer has great energy when he's lifting his arms here. He's tapping his toes with again, a lot of energy. He's also pumping his chest. So he's using his full body here and that's great. He needs to keep this energy just while executing this beat taller. The dancer is supposed to be doing two steps in place with his feet together and then sliding outward and repeating that two steps in the center and sliding outward. However, the slides outward are non-existent. The dancer is not using his space appropriately and so he needs to learn how to travel. He should be having one when he's sliding to the left, his left foot should be planting on the floor going outward while his right foot then chases it. But he is not doing that, he only widens his feet slightly instead of actually moving and making this a step that transfers him to a different part in space. The dancer is stepping very heavily on his feet. He could be less heavy on his feet if he moved his weight onto his toes. That would help all these shifts outward and across to be more smooth. The way in which the dancer is rolling through his chest is really good. It's showing a smooth dynamic as he extends his arm forward. He is having a sequential roll up through his spine and he's engaging his chest. That's a great articulation of that body part there. I would like to say the dancer has great energy in his arms already. He always has one arm higher than the other Alternating with which foot he's using. So if he's using His left foot his right arm is higher in the air and in that way He's engaging his chest and his arms quite a bit. So that's good", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As the dancer continues through a turning phrase a little bit more of an advanced choreographic movement, she's able to maintain consistent in her clarity in performing the step. However, she's really disconnected from the rhythm and is just kind of performing the step in a way that's a little bit stiff and not super connected through her full body. She would benefit from some more engagement of her upper body, her shoulders, her torso, and her pelvis, as well as her head. As the dancer begins to perform this partner social dance, she's demonstrating some fairly simple steps, but shows that she has an understanding of the basic movement vocabulary here. She's also got nice relaxed shoulders, which are engaged appropriately, as well as choreographically interesting arms and a nice engagement of the upper body in general. As the dancer continues to perform this kind of solo movement here, while she's got a nice range of motion in her body and is able to incorporate her full body into this movement, she's got a lot of extraneous movement, particularly in her arms and her hips, which is kind of throwing her off rhythm slightly and disconnecting her from the music as well as the movement vocabulary. As the dancer performs a series of turns, turning away from and then returning back into closeness with her partner, she continued to maintain the same amount of clarity. However, she would benefit from grounding through her movement more overall, bending those knees a bit more and dropping the pelvis back so that she's performing a more rooted sense of the movement, which will help her to more closely embody the rhythm and incorporate some additional movement dynamics into her performance. As the dancer performs a triple step and rock step with her partner, she's able to do so with clarity. However, I think as she's performing this movement, she's performing it at a bit of a slower tempo, which is keeping her from really embodying the rhythm and performing the step how it's meant to be performed with a certain sense of buoyancy.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So the climber right now sends the hand down. This will allow the climber to rest the hand and he shakes it in order to release any tension that has been built up. Whenever he's ready he will then stand up onto the feet being in place and pull himself in to make the higher reach up to the jug which seems to be a positive hold. In the moment that the climber made the high foot placement, placing the left foot against the big hold, which is no doubt that the climber has enough surface to keep pressure. The climber, when transferring the pressure, he had his right foot lose contact. So here the climber is now applying extra gripping power at the hands because of the climber's foot coming loose. This one was unintentional, so this tells me that the climber needs to also make sure he is able to be aware when transferring weight and continue to apply pressure at the feet. This is not a good technique because it can wear out the climber's grips and also because the climber will have to engage on a pull-up by engaging the arms to sustain such slip. The climber then sends the right foot into a high foot placement by sending the heel in towards the wall and behind the edge of the hold. This is called heel hooking because the climber will be able to pull on the hold with the heel and this will allow the climber to bring his center of gravity close to the wall since it's placed behind the jug. Also, later on when the climber needs to gain height, he can also not only pull but push down on the hold in order to transfer over the weight to the high foot. As the climber made the foot placement, this one driving force to the high foot, his right foot has slipped off from the wall, this because of the applied pressure. And the climber loses his center of gravity. This one, the climber quickly catches himself by sending his right hand down to the hold. And now the climber will have to engage on the core in order to gain a stability so that the climber can then bring his right foot back onto the wall. It seems as the climber was able to fit two fingers onto that small slot on the hold. So in order for the climber to sustain his grip, he slides the two fingers inside because he's able to apply them into the hold and will have to close the grip. Once he closes the grip, then he will have to create a pull-in position in order to sustain the grip. This is important that the climber is placing the grip appropriately as this is a strong one when the climber is making his way up due to being overhand, underhand. So when it's underhand, the climber is able to sustain the hold right now by pushing away from the wall. But once the climber starts gaining height while sustaining on the hold, the climber can still sustain it all the way down to his hips. Here we can see how the climber had brought the right hand to come into placement at the same hold. This is called matching. And he's only been able to fit a few fingers onto the match hold. So what he does is that he engages on a quick pull up. This will release some of the pressure on the left hand so the climber is able to bump it slightly to the left side in order to make space for the right hand to wrap around the hold. The climber is starting at a one-to-hold start. So the climber must place both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching. And as we can see, the type of hold, the way that the climber is holding on to it is by applying the palms to be, the bottom of the palm to be pressed against the hold. So the climber is able to send the fingers from above by pressing on the fingertips towards the hold. This will help the climber to then engage on a powerful pull-up once the climber gets to raise his hips off from the mat. And once the climber transfers the weight over to the limbs, then the climb will start. If the climber was going to perform this again, he had originally placed the heel hook above the edge of the jug and it would have been ideal if the climber placed it further out in order to have the edge of the jug to be hugging the outside of the heel. The reason why the climber, when the foot dropped, the climber's heel hook did not have enough edge to be supported on, the reason why the climber's heel hook came off from place. The climber was able to make the reach of the right hand coming into place at a jug. This one is a safe hold because it's positive and the climber is able to apply the fingers over it, pull on the lip and apply the thumb to squeeze and creating pressure on the hold to secure the grip. As the climber made the reach, he had lost contact of his left toe coming off the wall. So it's important that the climber continues to pull onto the monohold by bringing the elbow close to the core, even if the climber's center of gravity is still slightly away from the wall. So the reason why the climber has continually pressed on the right toe in order to stay in place from going further out. The climber has brought left foot into a high placement and no doubt the climber can apply pressure onto the toe box of the foot to meet the hold. And as we can see the climber is bringing the left hand to come into place onto a mono hold. It's a mono hold because the climber has only a small entry where only one finger is able to be applied inside of the hold. The climber was able to transfer over the left hand to the last hold and was able to do this due to securing the heel hook. Once the climber had secured the heel hook, he was sustaining to three points of contact on the wall which allowed him to release the left hand to go up for the last hold. Here the climber must hang on to the grips tight while making the foot switch. This is because the climber needs to release some of the pressure down below, but also continually to create pressure on the hold by placing the left toe on top of the hold. Once the climber gets to create pressure, the climber then is able to release the right foot from the foot hold. The climber quickly had brought the left toe into placement at the big hole down below. And also quickly the climber sensed after the foot placement the left hand to come into match. Both of the hands right now are holding onto a small rail. This is shallow so the climber is engaging onto a hand grip that's called crimp. As we can see the knuckles are sticking out. The climber places the fingertips as far in into the hold almost meeting the wall. And is creating friction at the fingertips and pressure by cupping the grips with the thumb towards the edge. He then is pulling in and maintaining a very close grip where it meets with the ball, the top bolt of the hand towards the edge. And he is pulling it in by also forcing the grip with keeping a tight pull where his elbows are slightly placed and engaged on a light pull up. This one the climber needs to make sure that he continues to give force onto the grips until he is able to make the next placement. Now that we can see the climber has brought his center of gravity to be as far up also engaging the pull. Down below we can see how the climber's left leg has been extended and this one the foot is pushing against the wall. This will help the climber to sustain the position between the two areas of support that are on the wall in order for him to make the hand placement. The climber was able to make the right foot placement onto the wall and before this the climber needed to sustain on that pull up with the grips in order to tense the body once the climbers swing Was decreasing then the climber was able to then make the foot placement Now the climbers glancing over at the next hold to be at reach Due to wanting to move out of this position that he's crunched up Here the climber was checking off his hands and this will help absorb any sweat that may be coming from the hands as well as gain a better grip when going to the holds. And as we can see the climber shakes the hands this is to release any tension that might be build up on the hands from previously climbing and also helps the climber to warm up the hands by shaking them. It's important that when the climber is doing a foot placement he glances down at the feet. In this case the climber is now bringing the right toe to come into place where the left foot is. He must apply pressure on the toe against the hold before releasing the left foot and he does this by sustaining on the grips with more pressure to allow releasing some pressure down at the feet but continually creating pressure at the hold to not lose contact with the hold. Here the climber is sending the right hand onto a shake. This will help the climber to release any buildup that has been applied to the grid. Also keeping the arms extended helps the climber to regenerate the muscles and any tension that has been build up. As he performs the rest he also is able to glance at the wall to check what would be the next move on the sequence and when the climber is ready then he will make a hand placement either to match or to the next move. As the climber was doing the back flag, the toe has bumped against the hold and this through the climber's position where the foot now is no longer creating that force to be elevated. When he dropped the foot, the climber's right foot has come out of place which was the heel hook and this will be an immediate drop of his weight which would not be sufficient for the climber to sustain the grips since the grips are right now staying with friction and accurate pressure when extending the arms. So the climber coming down would be really difficult for the climber to sustain the move. Here the climber needs to go to the next hold being at reach. So he places the right foot into a high placement when it was down below flagging, meaning that there wasn't any placement on that right foot, and brought it into a high stance quickly to adjust the hips over to the right side to make sure that the climber is able to transfer the weight over to the highest foot. And as we can see, the climber relies on the grip by extending the arms, which will relax the arms for a second while the climber glances over at the hold at distance. And when the climber is ready, he will then engage into a forceful pull up so that once the climber's chest reaches the grips, the climber is able to send the right hand up and bring his core or hips over the highest foot in order to sustain going up for the reach. Here the climber has released intentionally the left foot from placement. This so that the climber is able to extend the left leg, this one being flagging out, which will help the climber to transfer over the weight to the foot being in place. Now it's important that the climber keeps the flag out because it helps the climber to keep his center of gravity close to the wall, meaning that it will support with the climber's twist going out to the right because it helps with the climber staying with his right side towards the wall when going up for the reach. Here the climber was able to make the reach out placing the left hand onto the jug. This is a jug because the climber can comfortably wrap the hands, the fingers around the lip of the hold and as soon as he secures the placement he's able to pull on the grip by keeping the elbow out to engage it onto forcing the grip to sustain himself in place. Now in order for the climber to get to this hold he had initially pushed down on the right foot that is placed against the wall and has extended. The moment that the climber has extended the leg then the center of gravity is transferred over to the highest foot. Also this leg being extended and pushed away and pushed against the wall helps the climber with going with the direction when going out for the reach. Here we can see the climber sending the left leg to be extended. This is called a back flag where the climber is folding the leg behind the foot being in place. So he first had it flagged out and quickly has sent slowly and then with control to be released towards the right side. That to allow himself to bring his center of gravity low to extend the left arm as the climber needs to continually apply pressure of the grip on that open hand and slanted hold where the climber needs to create pressure by having friction of the skin towards the flat edge of the hold and places the thumb on the outside to keep the grip in place. The back flag would allow the climber to transfer the weight over to the high placement of the hand and the heel hook is strong to stay in place bringing his center of gravity close to the wall when bending the leg. So the climber here will need to release the right hand from place in order to match at the last hold reason why the climber is performing this position. The climbers are starting at a sit-down start. A sit-down start meaning that the climber is seated on the mat and places the hands and feet onto the wall. Once the climber has made the placements, then he will need to rise his hips towards the wall, weighing, transferring the weight over to the limbs. It usually is known that sit starts add a grade of difficulty to the climb due to starting in this position.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

His knee is now facing to the left side of the room. He's turning his knee inward, which is not necessary. He shouldn't have any twisting of the leg, either to the outside or to the inside here. His leg should just be properly aligned with his knee facing forward and not turning to face the side. The dancer is twisting his torso here. His upper body or his torso is twisted to his right while his arms are pointing towards his left. And so they're not properly aligned. His torso should really be completely forward and his arms should be forward in front of him, not off to the side. The dancer's turn should take four counts. He should be walking one, two, three, touch four, or walking five, six, seven, touch eight, but instead he takes five counts for this turn. So now anything that he does is going to be a count behind in the music because right now his feet are together and touching and he's about to step outward. And now his step outward is going to be happening on the second measure of the beat instead of the first. So now anything he does here on forward is going to be off rhythm. He's going to be one count behind because he took one extra step on that turn when he turned around. He took five steps instead of four steps. The dancer executes his directions again correctly here. He travels first to his right, then he turns around his left shoulder to face the back, then he turns around his right shoulder to face the front, and now he travels again to his left. So he travels to his right, turns around his left shoulder, that's traveling to the left, turns around his right shoulder, traveling to the right, and then goes outward to the left. So he is going here right, left, right, left, and his directions are great. Walking across 1, 2, 3, 4, turning 5, 6, 7, 8, turning 1, 2, 3, 4, and back out 5, 6, 7, 8. The dancer's arms are out to the side. Instead, his arms should be in front of him, and they should be moving with his legs moving. So when he moves his right leg, he should be moving his left arm a bit downward. And when he moves his left leg, he should be moving his right arm a bit downward. So his arms should be alternating between lower and higher, but they should be in front of him, not at his sides as they are here. Not only are her his hips not going in opposition, they're going in the same direction, but even as he is moving his hips incorrectly in terms of direction, he's still not also moving them largely enough. So his hips are moving side to side slightly as he's doing this basic bachata step right and left, but really his hips should be moving further out with every step. And we should see a hip movement. It should be very clear to the eye to see his hips moving from side to side. That should be obvious. His arms continue to not do much I understand he's lifting one of them Sometimes alternatively to turn a ghost partner, which is not there but independent of these turns His arms are not doing much and they really should be moving up and down in front of him, which Could help if he had some movement in his ribcage Horizontally right and left just like his hips should be moving right and left which they aren't really But moving his hips and moving his ribs would help initiate some arm movement as well instead They're just hanging there for the most part The dancer does a great job in terms of direction again here before he was facing the back of the room and Traveling to his right then he turned around his left shoulder to face the front and now he's moving again To the right which is now our left side of the screen since he is facing forward so he moved right and then left and then right which is great directionally and Rhythmically when he went to the right he went one two three touch four He turned around his left shoulder five six seven touch eight and now he's starting again to the side on his left on count One so he is on rhythm and directionally in the right correct direction here The dancer also turned taking the appropriate amount of steps. So when he was walking to his left, he walked one, two, three, touch four. He turned around on five, six, seven, touch eight. That way he could start again traveling to his left on count one. So he is on rhythm here. We also see further here this twist of his torso and an extension of his arms to the side in the ego view. We see that his right arm is in the air and it's pointing towards the left and really if he had a partner when she was turning here his hand should be directly in front of him instead of towards his left side. The dancer is on good rhythm here in this basic step. Going to his left on counts 1, 2, 3, tapping on count 4, then going to his right on counts 5, 6, 7, and tapping on count 8. The dancer is still one count behind as previously mentioned because he took an extra step on a turn before So right now it's count eight and his feet should really be together, but his feet are apart Because he's really up to what would be count seven on the rhythm of count eight So he is one count behind in the music Again, the dancer continues to turn his knees and with some rotation. So now his knee is facing to our left side of the screen or to his right. And really his knee should be facing straight forward, not turned to a diagonal or to the side in any which direction, whether it's inward or outward. Right here it is inward, but either inward or outward are both incorrect. His knee should just inside be facing completely forward. The dancer does a good job on executing directions here. He was traveling before to his left or our right side of the screen. And then as he turns around, he turns around his right shoulder to face the back of the room. And then he wants again, travels to his left. So he traveled to his left, turning around his right side and then travels again to his left. And that way he's traveling left, right and left. And that is correct. The dancer never got back onto rhythm and he remained one count behind from this mistake that he made prior in the music. He remained in timing in terms of all the steps he did, did take four counts. However, just wasn't in timing with the music. He remained one count behind in the music. But he maintained a steady dance in terms of he did remain only one count behind in the music. That was stable. He didn't get further behind in the music. Just instead he should have caught this mistake and got him back on the music instead of remaining one count behind it. If we look at the ego view, his eyes are moving around a lot. We see this camera shaking quite a bit and in different areas of the room. Right here he's looking downward. We see his hands in the screen, which makes it obvious that he's looking downward. And the dancer shouldn't be looking downward like this. He should be looking outward, straightforward. But also his eyes shouldn't be darting between left and right to different areas of the room. It should be one scan of complete forward, just going horizontally sideways in the direction that he's traveling. So when he's traveling to his left, our right side of the screen, his eyes should be at the same plane, just traveling in that direction. And when he's going to his right or our left side of the screen, the ego cam should be scanning completely at the same level, just to panning across horizontally. So because it's moving around quite so much, we can tell that his head is doing some extra movements that are not necessary and that are distracting. And it disallows his spine from being aligned. Instead he's now bending here at the head. So his spine is bent forward here on the top instead of his spine should be in a straight line. The dancer is not moving his hips in opposition of his legs. When he's stopping here with his left foot, his hips should be moving to his right. Instead, his hips are moving in the same direction as his foot, which is not correct. They should be going in opposition from his feet.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And this climber did quickly switching the feet, going down onto the two holes below and then has gone up for a quick sprint while keeping the left toe in place and sends the knee inwards. Again the knee drop and the right leg has been extended, also tapping the wall to support the climber, keeping the hips close to the wall. And this can help the climber to have more extension when going for the reach. As we can see the climber has made the move out left, this one being a pinch. When pinches are closed grip, the climber is able to engage more force onto the pinch. And as we can see the climber was able to pick up the right foot and instead of placing it into a hold, was pressing it against the wall. This one so that can keep the climber with balance and instead driving all of its force over to the left toe. Since the climber is bringing their center of gravity over to the left side for then the climber to bring the reach. As seen, the climber was actually able to hang on to the grips but not as tightly as he could have due to when making the move for the left foot, the foot has swung out and quickly made the placement onto the mat, ending the climb. And the future of the climber was to do this move. They need to keep their court tighter in order to avoid having the left foot swing out as he makes the placement. Here we can see the climber has gone ahead and shocked their hands. This is for the climber to have a better grip when on the wall and also will help the climber to absorb any sweat that may be coming from his hands. Here the climber spends some time to locate a foot placement for the right foot on the wall and was doing this but sustaining a pinch down below with the right hand and also was had the hand placed in a different way where the thumb before was wrapping onto the right side of the hold and while the climber was trying to position the foot the climber then slightly had turned the hand inwards to then make the thumb placement on the other side. The climber at first when they got to the top reach had placed the hand with the middle finger above and the two fingers on one side and the thumb on the right side. It was an awkward way of holding on to the pinch but it was the best that the climber could do at that moment since it was completely extended towards the wall when at the reach so the climber was using the right hand to pull himself in while placing the foot and when engaged the arm with much closer the climber was able to turn the top hand inwards in order to have a better grip. As the climber was doing this the climber then has placed a foot positioning for a higher hold but wasn't able to sustain the grip which is the reason why the climber left foot has stepped out of the wall. The climber quickly have swapped their left toe with the right toe and this is so that the climber is able to make the position and place for the reach. The climber needs to keep the right side towards the wall to help gain reach and does this by sending the right knee over pointing out left. When the knee is pointing the opposite direction as inwards is called knee drop and the climber does this to keep the right side towards the wall. Now the other leg being the left leg extended is called flagging out and the climber also does this by pressing the toe against the wall to help generate force to keep the hips towards the right side. Here we can see the climber positioning the hands onto the one start hold. When both hands are in the same hold, this is called matching. Also, once the climber gets to bring their right foot onto the wall, then the climber starts.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She really should hold that final pose that she well executed and coordinated with one hand on her hip and one hand behind her head. Especially because it's so quick and she gets there so quickly, it's more the important that we see it. So she shouldn't be exiting that position as quickly as she is here. Especially given it's the final, it's the last position we see, so she really needs to hold it. The dancer has a great range of motion for the space that she takes up. On the step leading to the jump, she traveled far horizontally across the room, which is great. The dance should be adamant and very assertive like this. She is definitely assertive and adamant in her movements. One indication of that is how far she's traveling across the floor. The dancer's arm position here is very good. Her arm is in a straight line and her shoulder blade here, her left shoulder blade is anchored downward, so it's not in her ear. So we get to see a great deal of her neck here. So that's really great positioning of her arm. The dancer's heel in this first time she does this heel step with her toes raised it's very good right here because her toes are raised far off the ground so we see this angle that she's creating here with her foot. However, she's about to repeat this step two times more coming forward in front of her which is towards the left side of the room and the heel position is not held as well. Her toes are not lifted off the floor to the extent on the second and third time as they are on this first time. Her toes should be or her foot should be in the same position each time. It shouldn't be changing the angle every time. The dancer's rhythm on this basic salsa step was very good. She stepped forward one, two, and then on three, she came back to the center and held and now stays in the center without her weight shifted forward or backwards for one count. That's count four. So this pause on count four is an anchor in salsa rhythm and she is executing that with her body by not moving on that count four. One mistake here is that the dancer's weight is concentrated on her heels. Her heels are on the floor and her toes are lifted off the floor while she is doing this revolution counterclockwise. Instead it should be the opposite. Her toes should be on the floor, her heels should be off the floor to balance her weight while she's spinning. The dancer does a really good job of leaning far forward here. We see that her chest is angled downward or she leans forward from her right leg. She's in front of her right leg with her chest downward. And that's great that she's doing that because now the next movement that she's going to do, which is a body roll backwards, it's going to have a great range of motion and level changes because she's bending forward and over so much. So this step here is preparing her to make the next step she does very large. The dancer is really emphasizing her chest pump forward by swinging her arms backwards. So this opposition here is making each movement look bigger. The chest bump looks bigger because her arms are swung backwards and her arms swinging backwards look like they're further behind her because she's chest pumping forward. These are oppositional energies work to her advantage in making the both movements combined look larger. She could improve her wrist positioning here. It's breaking the line of the arm, so her arm is straight, but her wrist breaks that angle. So either she needs to break that angle more severely so that it's a 90 degree angle from her arm, or her wrist should be straight in line and extending that, or finishing that line of her arm. Dancer also has good alignment here. Her spine is in a straight line while she's bent over and then her back leg, her left leg, is also in a straight line. So both of those lines are very clear here.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So it seems like she's really just focused on this hold, this hand, and this left foot, but everything's going to kind of come from that right foot and really driving up through that hold because that hold's really just not going to do anything until she's above it.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

On the left in that ego view, great point of contact on the backboard right up by that top left white corner, which will help get the best angle so it can fall in the basket as well as away from more athletic, more advanced defenders that might be able to block it off the backboard. He also jumped off the roof. You'll see though, he's almost barely jumping on his layups, which in order to get the most effective results and the ability to translate these skills into the game, he should really be jumping and exploding at a higher level, where we should see his hand almost to the backboard or even higher for more advanced players.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So he strummed the chord and then played the melody with his pointer finger and his ring finger and going between the two sounded very smooth. He had to shift down the fingerboard to reach this chord shape here, and this is a chord shape that looks a little tricky because it's spanning four frets from his first finger to his fourth finger, but then he's also having to tuck his ring finger underneath his middle finger there, so that takes a bit of coordination, because not only is it slightly an awkward hand shape, but he also has to do a shift there as well. Nice job. He's using a finger picking pattern here with his thumb, his pointer finger, and his middle finger and the finger picking pattern is really consistent and really steady. You can hear each note very evenly. The guitarist moved his first finger here down the fingerboard and he found the note really accurately and got in the right spot in the right fret to play the scale. There's a few moments as he's doing this fast finger plucking pattern where his finger catches a wrong string for just a brief moment. It's mostly very clean, but there's just a few notes here and there that stick out. There were a few notes that didn't quite resonate as clearly, and I think it's because his pointer finger sort of touched this open string a little bit and muted the sound for a brief moment. So there was a couple notes that didn't quite ring properly. As he's playing this fast finger picking pattern with his right hand, he moved chord shapes with his left hand, and he did it really smoothly, and you couldn't really perceive that he was changing it. So that was a really nicely timed and really coordinated change of the chord shape with his left hand. The guitarist's fingers are curved and bent at the knuckles right here, so he's using his fingertips to get a clear tone on those notes that he just played. The guitarist is strumming in this sweet spot right here over the strings, so it's not really over the tone hole, but it's a little bit over, but he's getting a really nice tone because of where he's placing his fingers. As he's playing the finger picking pattern here, he's being even more steady and even more even with these fast notes. The last note that he played with his pinky, he added a little bit of vibrato and moved his finger back and forth to warm up the sound and it sounded really pretty. His right hand is using alternating fingers to pluck these notes, which is what you're supposed to do in guitar techniques. He's using his pointer finger and his middle finger plucking at the nails alternating between the two fingers.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So in order to do that, what you see is that he's placed his plant foot next to the ball, right? And he's sort of, instead of it being directly this way here, he's opened it up a little bit which allows his hips to turn a little bit more sideways as opposed to being straight on, like more square, which is good because that's going to allow him to more efficiently turn in this direction when he goes. So that's something that we'd recommend. He's in good balance, so his plant foot at the moment, knee bent, slightly bent over. That's good posture to be able to effectively get out of this because when he turns, we want to be able to push off this plant leg here in that direction. Wants to be able to go there. And then the technique of catching the ball, you can see that he's hooked his foot around the ball so that it's able to effectively go this way when he makes contact with it. If he was contacting it more on the side of the ball here, it would be harder for him to be able to execute this turn. So this technique calls for hooking his foot inward to be able to contact it behind it and make it go underneath his body here and then he'll just turn out and go the other direction. This is the second part of the sole roll that we just looked at because he just rolled the ball over with his right foot here in this direction here and then now he's catching the ball with his left foot and Still close proximity to his body So, you know what we're seeing is that he shows a lot of control and comfort of using both feet But also the balls close and he's touching the ball or contacting the ball almost every single step here So you see he just rolled the ball over with his right foot His next step is he's catching the ball with his left foot here Now he could go in multiple directions based off of this but this is correct because now he's maintaining control of the ball after the sole roll and Setting him up to do another skill with his right foot if he wants to to either change direction Going back this way here Or he could go efficiently in this direction here if you'd like to but a good picture of what the catch looks like after a sole roll You Because he's moving at a controlled, slower speed, this is not anywhere near what this subject's high speed would be. This is probably below like a middle range speed for him. It's a close controlled activity where the focus is more on ball contacts or number of ball contacts versus speed, right? So at the speed that he's moving, what we're seeing is this is typically the distance of which the ball is to his body. That's a really clear picture of what we would want to teach someone who didn't know how to do the sport. Like this is a really good picture of what this would look like. We wanna make this as a reference. It's in front of his body, it's not out to the side. You can see that his body position, he's bent with his knees, slightly bent over with his upper body torso. He's tracking the ball with his eyes. A good picture of what the technique should look like. It's just being performed at a slow speed. So the distance for the ball to his body, this is like an ideal distance for him moving at that speed and the ball is in total control in this picture. The subject is performing a close control freestyle dribbling activity where he's asked to stay inside the box, the yellow box here that's marked clearly by the cones and maintain close control of the ball. He can dribble anywhere he wants to inside the space and turn with any surface of the foot that he likes to. It doesn't matter. He can use right foot or he can use left foot up to him to completely do what he wants here. The only requirement that we're asking is that the ball stays close to his body. The ball remains in the ground so he's not popping the ball up in the air. And then he just maintains a controlled speed so that he can perform the action at a very similar level consistently throughout the length of the whole bout for the activity. What we're looking at just from the standpoint of body control is just his body positioning. So you can see knees slightly bent, slightly forward tilt in his upper body torso, tracking the ball with his eyes. So he's looking down. He's very focused on the ball in this case. The only thing I would probably recommend because he's so proficient and you'll see we know that he's very proficient based on the way that he dribbles and moves with the ball is to challenge himself at times to look up as opposed to just looking straight down the entire time. So this is another variation in turning with the ball to go in the opposite direction this way here. So really similar to a Cruyff turn in the sense of his plant foot is going to be next to the ball as is. So that's good foot placement and it's slightly opened, not completely facing this direction here, which will allow him to kind of turn already with his hips a little bit more this direction here. So that as he turns he can, as he pushes the ball this direction, he can effectively turn to get this way here with his body. So he's already starting the motion in this still image of moving in that direction. Instead of using the inside of his foot to wrap around the ball, he's using the bottom of his foot or the sole of his foot to catch the ball on top of it. And he simply just pulls it backwards this direction then here to move in that direction. So he's showing good balance in this picture here. He's using the correct technique to pull the ball back. His placement foot is next to the ball. That's where we want it to be. That's a really good picture of what that looks like. So a nice example if we were going to teach someone a pull turn to move in the opposite direction of what this would look like. The skill that he's using in this still frame is called a scissor move. So what it is, is that he brings his right foot around the ball this way without contacting the ball. So you can see that he's stepping right now. He's in mid motion of stepping around the ball here. And then what he'll do is he can plant on that foot and then push the ball off in a different direction with his opposite foot. He shows really good proficiency here that he's able to do this really nice and tight to his body. The ball is not way out in front of him because he's not running this direction. So this makes sense that the ball would be underneath him and close to his body in this instance here. So good control of his body throughout the motion here. Really nice timing of moving his foot around to be able to plant on that side of things. Not much I would recommend in this picture, just pointing out that this is called a scissor move where he's moving his foot around the ball as a feint to be able to then move in a different direction, potentially to escape an opponent this way. Here, we're seeing him use a dribbling technique that's called the sole roll. So the sole roll, what you can see is that the top of his foot is actually, or the bottom of his foot is on top of the ball. So what he's done is the ball is out slightly in front of his body. It's not underneath him directly. So this is a good position to use this technique. He's leaning in the direction that he wants to go. So which is this way here. So you can see that he has a little bit of lean in his body. Short knee, obviously he's flexed here. So it was a little bit bent. So we know that he's loaded, that he can move on that leg. And what he's done is he's just grabbed the ball on this side of it and rolling his foot over the ball this direction here. So he's showing really nice control of his body in coordination with performing the action. Right now he's mid sequence of completing this. So a nice example of what the skill looks like using the sole roll of his foot. And he's just going to drag the ball now to continue to go this way. He'll roll his foot over the ball and he'll continue moving in that direction.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I think some of the steps could be a little bit grander but otherwise really nice job with the jump and still rotating and moving her body around as she jumps side to side. I think when she turned around it could have been a much quicker snap around just to get back to the front. It was lagging just a little bit. I think with her level of energy and technique I think she could have got around much cleaner just to really snap to get around to face the front. So here overall, I think she had a really great performance. I just think it was a few just small moments that could have been a little cleaner, just the details for this advanced choreography, but otherwise really nice overall. So here's where I noticed a little slip up in her balance as she kicked her leg around and got into this position. This right foot was not as grounded to the floor so she took a small little hop and just almost lost her balance in that moment. So making sure I would say bend this knee a bit more so you're really stable in that step and then you are able to just rotate this left leg out in as she did. But really nice arms lifted up over the head and eyes are straightforward so otherwise the body looks great there. The dancer starts kind of the pre-choreography with just some steps, also steps front and back. She has a really great energy that matches the intensity of the music and her knees can be slightly bent just a little bit more as she steps and even when she steps back just keeping those knees constantly bent and loose but really nice energy in the upper body as her arms rotate around. So here when she rolls back, I would like to see the same intensity of the body roll as she had in the beginning. Again, bending those knees would help a lot right here. And then really stepping back on this right foot and lifting up that heel. The arms are nice. Her eyes are straight forward. But definitely bending the knees would have helped to get a better roll in her body. So here just a small detail when she jumps out I think her eyes could have looked up at the arm just to keep that that full motion as where she our body is going so not forgetting that your head is also part of your body so sometimes just a turn of the head can make a world of a difference in a step. So here in the first eight counts, just really nice body roll all the way down from her head to her toes, keeping those knees bent as she rolls through, but you see the full movement and roll throughout her body. So really nice job there.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Because the pianist is playing them slightly shorter, it's a little bit abrupt feeling and it takes us out of the smooth phrase of the music. The pianist prematurely stopped their crescendo just here. They should have crescendoed all the way to this point, but they stopped their crescendo just a few seconds before this. Really excellent balance in terms of volume between the two hands right here. In the figure being played with the right hand, where we have a two-note slur, instead of what she is doing, which is emphasizing that suspension of the note, of the first note of each slur, by having a little bit more of an accent, ideally we would want just a little bit more volume, no accent, and a tiny bit more length to bring out that. It sounds a little bit heavy-handed right now for the style of this music. We need to hear a little bit more of the highest note that was just played. Because we couldn't quite hear that highest note, we lost a little bit of the shape of the line. We need a little bit more length and volume on the highest notes just played in the right hand here Because they're so high in the piano and the strings are so thin it's just not going to resonate as much So just a little bit more length and volume on those notes so we can really hear the beginning of that line The pianist did a really nice job at that resolution just there of not playing out of rhythm, but playing as close to that beat and on the beat as possible, so that they could have an effect of slowing down, but really didn't slow down at all. So that's really well done. Ideally, these notes and chords being played with the left hand here would be lighter and softer in order to match the character of the right hand and the style of this piece. We want them to be a little bit more gentle. Right now they're coming across as a little aggressive and a little heavy handed, so just a lighter touch there would help support the right hand instead of kind of overpower the right hand. I'm not going to do too much of the left hand here. Really excellent light touch with the last notes, the Gs played in the left hand here. Really great resonance, a very present dynamic, we can really hear it, but not overbearing. It still gives us a gentle end to this piece, so that's really well done. We'd like to hear a little bit more volume on the descending scale just played with the left hand because it's interesting moving notes. We want to bring that out a little bit more and we bring it out with volume. The pianist did a great job of starting this new phrase at a nice, comfortable dynamic, a little bit softer than the other phrase ended, so that the listener now knows we're starting a new section. So it's well done. That's a really great example of how to approach a cadence. Right here, the music resolved and the pianist did a nice decrescendo, which gave a good relaxed final feeling to that cadence. So it's very well done musically.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Definitely some moments where I felt like she could have just really slowed down a bit, even though the music is fast, but really do the full movement and not cut it off. And I think that really definitely elevated her performance. So here, really nice job with just stepping out and touching together. She had a really nice flow in her body, so just really kind of moving like a, almost like jello in a sense, just really wavy and flowy, really nice. Also in this walk forward, it looks like she was flat on her feet, so make sure you're up on the balls of the feet for that part. So here, when she reached her arm down, I really wanted her to lunge out and really open her legs out and then reach all the way down to the floor. That's one of the moments where she cut off the movement and could have just made it fuller if she just kind of took her time in that movement. So here the only thing I'd say about these parts is just watch her feet. Trying to not keep them flat the whole time, really just stepping on the balls of the feet so that way your movements are much lighter. So nice job on the turn. I felt like she could have added just a little bit more energy around. It kind of started to slow down and stop for a second, but she made it back around. Definitely want to make sure you push enough force around to get your spins as long as you need them to go. So here as she rolls her arms around, I noticed this arm felt a little just kind of short, so not really extending it out. So definitely extend your arms out so it looks like big circles turning around. So here the dancer starts off really well. She is hitting all the steps correctly and staying on beat and everything looks great so far. So here in this front salsa step, definitely could have made that bigger as far as her arms, really rolling them around, also adding some hip movements to the side. It just felt really stiff in this moment. So here she's stepping forward. Her twist felt a little off, so making sure if the left leg is forward as it is right now, she would twist her body to the right. If the right leg is forward, she would twist her body over to the left. So just making sure that is the right way. And up to here again so far, really great job. She's staying with the music and really just has a nice flow throughout her body. Her energy is just really mellow, but it definitely works because she's kind of dazing to the musical part of it. So really nice job so far.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

And as soon as he brought his hips in to rise on the pull up, keeping the body stiff, the climber then will have pushed on the foot to gain length so the climber would have an easier time when making the placement of the fingers in behind the lip of the hold. The climbers is starting at a two hand hold start. As we can see the right hand the climbers placing it as a pinch So the fingers are in one side of the hold and the thumb is pressed against the hold on the other side In order for the climber to sustain this he will have to press on the hold with the fingers towards it creating a clamp Motion and keeping the elbow out in order to give it friction now The left hand as we can see is placed in a different hold this one is a much shallower hold so the climber is placing the grip closed and placing the fingertips above This for the climber to sustain the left hand must keep the elbow close to the wall once transferring the weight to the grips The climb will start until the climbers feet are on the wall It was easier for the climber to move the left hand out of his position since the pinch is a better hold to sustain when making the next move. So the left hand has gone up for a placement and as we can see only the ring finger was able to be placed on the hold. Now the climber had raised the hips but has not brought himself into enough height in order to make the placement of the hand inside the edge. This will result the climber to overcompensate on the grip and resulting a fall.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

It would definitely help to pause in between each exercise, look through the first pattern of pitches, think about the finger style pattern before playing right away, to get more success on the first attempt with this phrase. Here the highest pitch in this phrase was muted. It would help to check on the pinky in the left hand and make sure that the finger pad is pushing in the center of the fret directly on top of the string and away from the metal bar of the fret to get the clearest possible sound. It would help to practice the first phrase in this exercise multiple times at a slower tempo to review the pattern of pitches that is needed and also to review the finger style pattern in the right hand to get more comfortable with this phrase and more success when first attempting it. There was also difficulty here with the right hand finger style pattern. Again here it could help to just practice the finger style pattern for this exercise using the open strings, then add the cords back and perform the alternating pattern again slowly to get more comfortable with the alternation of the right hand fingers. Here another incorrect pitch was played and the phrase is being restarted. Here an incorrect pitch was played multiple times. The guitarist then restarted their phrase with the correct pitch to fix this mistake. During this exercise the guitarist had good accuracy with their chord shapes in the left hand fingers and also had more success and accuracy with the finger style pattern in the right hand. Here an incorrect pitch was played. It would help to just practice the first chord while strumming all six strings. Switch the second chord, strumming all six strings, go back and forth a few times to get comfortable with these two shapes and shifting from one chord to the other, and then go back and add the finger style pattern while playing each of these chords at a slow tempo to get more accuracy with the pitch and shifting from one chord to the next. Again here there was a lot of hesitation with the right hand and the finger style pattern. It would definitely help to take the open strings and focus on just watching the right hand fingers, getting more accurate aim and consistency when playing this pattern multiple times in a row. Then slowly add the cord shapes back, continue to practice this pattern at a slow speed multiple times to get more accurate and comfortable with the alternation of the right hand fingers when playing the strings one at a time. Here the aim of the right hand thumb when strumming. The string was a bit off and needed to be adjusted. It would help to keep an eye on the right hand fingers when playing this finger style pattern. The guitarist has started playing another exercise. So far their pitches are being played accurately. You can see left hand fingers one, two, and three are curved and pressing towards the center of the frets, but the left hand thumb is starting to reach around the side of the guitar. This can be problematic, especially if it starts to push on the strings on the front of the fret board, so it would definitely help to reposition the thumb and move it more towards the back of the neck. Here an incorrect pitch was played, but the guitarist kept going and maintaining their steady tempo. The guitarist is now performing the right hand pattern with more success. They just performed it three times in a row with the correct alternation of the right hand fingers playing each string. The guitarist is beginning one of their exercises. You can see the left hand fingers are curved and pressing towards the center of the frets. They are playing the strings one at a time using their right hand thumb, pointer, and middle fingers. The guitarist is demonstrating proper left hand finger position. You can see the fingers are curved and pressing down towards the center of the frets and the thumb is on the back of the neck of the guitar. Here, another error in pitch was made, and this phrase needed to be restarted. Here there was a lot of difficulty and hesitation with the finger style pattern. It would help to even play this pattern with open strings a few times while watching the right hand fingers and then add the chord shape back and play the pattern multiple times in a slow tempo then gradually work it up to speed while keeping an eye on the fingers to get more successful at the alternating pattern. Here, a slight error was made in the fingerstyle pattern, but the guitarist quickly corrected it and is moving on with the rest of the phrase without losing any speed to their tempo. The beginning of this phrase needed to be attempted multiple times. It would help to review the beginning of this phrase and the pitches and strings that are needed here. Play them a few times at a slow tempo to get more familiar with them and also be able to play them more accurately on the first try when starting this phrase. The guitarist is continuing to demonstrate an improvement in pitch and is slowly getting more comfortable with the finger style pattern the more they are performing and practicing each of these exercises. Here there was an error in the alternating right hand finger style pattern. This mistake was not corrected and the guitarist is continuing on.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

When the dancer just stepped out to turn, crossing one foot in front of the other and holding it in place would have allowed the dancer to turn around their axes and be more balanced. The turn that the dancer has at the very end was excellent. It was around their axis. So they took their foot and brought it around, touching on the ball of their toe, and they held their legs very tightly together so that they could do a full rotation.

And that's because there's not a lot of sensitivity that you're able to have the further up the key you are. So having a more natural curve to the fingers will put your fingers lower down in the key and you're going to have more control of the key in that position. We're hearing some inaccuracies with these shifts on each arpeggio. That again will be fixed by using a fingering that involves a crossover. But if you do use this fingering, you have to shift fast but then be slow at the last moment so that you accurately come down on the right note. You can't have the shift be full speed all the way until you're pressing down the note because it's just going to increase the possibility for inaccuracy. So taking this at a slower tempo would help. We're losing on that last arpeggio some consistency of articulation, specifically the notes being played with the first finger on the right hand and the fifth finger on the left hand are coming out as much heavier than the others. You just have to be careful about that. We hear a big gap in between these two arpeggios. It's because the pianist is not using a fingering where the first finger crosses under in the left hand and the third finger crosses over in the right hand. So using that fingering will allow you to connect these two arpeggios. We'd like to hear the pianist play this at a slower tempo so that he would be able to make these shifts in time, because now we've lost the pulse. So we'd rather have a slower tempo with a good pulse than a faster tempo with no pulse. The pianist has good consistency of articulation throughout these arpeggios. We hear that the notes have a similar start to them and a similar length to all of them, so that's very good. We'd like to see these wrists a little bit higher. We can see that they're sitting below the keys of the piano, which is causing the fingers to outstretch more than they need to. So a little higher wrist, a little more curve to the finger.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Again, the dancer is looking at the corner for a clue before she does the next dance step. And really the dancer should be focused forward, especially since she's about to do a turnaround. She wants to be spotting where it is that she's going to end up and shouldn't be looking into the corner right now. The dancer's shoulders are very fluid. She's alternating up and down with each shoulder and as she's doing that she's also alternating her hands from up and down and that is really great that she is not stiff in her shoulders and is also using them to further explore the salsa dance steps. She's embellishing it with style here. The dancer adds some stylistic and choreographic elements of her own here. She brings her hands to her hips right prior to this and now brings her hands to her head. These are artistic choices that she is choosing. They're not necessarily in the choreography. She's choosing to style her arms like that and it gives us a sense of who she is. It's nice that she is adamant about this choice. She definitely places her hands in a specific position of her choosing. The dancer's last extension of her left arm is bent. She doesn't actually complete a full vertical line above her. Even though this is the last version of this dance step, it's the last time she's doing it, she should still be doing it as fully as she did the other ones preceding it. The dancer reaches a fully stretched vertical position with her hand, which is wonderful. The dancer can have more energy in her arm movement here as she brings them or swings them down and up. She can do that with more emphasis and eventually straighten her arms. It's okay that they do bend here but they should reach a straight position at some point before they bend. The dancer should be ending this turn looking forward. It changes the shape of her body when she looks to the side and also it's a way to get dizzy or not complete the turn fully. She wants to really do a 360 degree turn but she doesn't or she risks not completing the turn when her head is looking to the side because normally her body would also be facing wherever her head is. It's good that she's actually able to isolate her head from the rest of her body but it's very easy for your body to follow suit whatever your head is doing. So if she does look into this corner it risks that her shoulders and her hips would also face this corner and then instead of doing a 360 degree revolution of a turn she would end up doing maybe like a 6 eighths of a turn so or maybe 7 eighths probably a bit more than 3 quarters but yeah she's risking not completing the turn fully by looking in that corner. The dancer's shoulders are also very well coordinated when she steps with her left foot her left shoulder also goes down The dancer seems to already be looking at the corner of the room into the mirror for clues perhaps from her teacher So it shows that she's struggling Already to memorize the routine and might need help as she goes through it", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here again the intonation was a bit off after shifting and the violinist quickly adjusted their fingers placement on the fingerboard to improve the intonation of this particular pitch. The intonation was slightly off when first playing this highest pitch using the pinky The musician quickly adjusted their pinkies placement on the fingerboard to get this pitch more in tune You can see here due to the angle of the bow two strings are being played instead of just one that is needed here. It would help to work on playing this pitch while watching the bow and adjusting the angle and weight distribution of the bow so that just one string is sounding at a time here. Here the violinist is getting a nice clear delicate sound when performing their highest pitches in this set of arpeggios. Again, here the angle and weight distribution of the bow needs to be adjusted to eliminate the extra string that is being played here. Again, here multiple strings are heard instead of just one. It would help to adjust the angle and weight distribution of the bow. Here, when transitioning from playing the top string to string number three, you can hear both strings sounding at the same time for a second or two. It would help to adjust the angle of the bow and distribute the weight of the bow over the next string that is needed more quickly so that you just hear the next string being played and not the previous string being played at the same time when switching. Here the violinist made one error in pitch. They quickly corrected their mistake and played the correct pitch and are continuing on with the rest of the scale. The violinist is performing a major scale. They are playing with a legato articulation or smooth and connected notes. The violinist is attempting this same set of arpeggios again. This time they are having more success with the intonation and you could tell that with even more practice their intonation would continue to improve. Again here when switching to play the next string with the bow, the previous string was heard a bit at the same time. Again here, one mistake in pitch was made during this scale and the violinist is correcting their mistake again. their bow is angled better and the weight is distributed better so that just one pitch and one string is being played at a time here. Here there was a bit of an intonation issue when shifting. It would help to practice the pitch before the shift leading into the pitch after the shift multiple times to get more comfortable with this transition and to improve the intonation between these two pitches and to get a smoother sound quality. The violinist restarted this set of arpeggios and adjusted their finger placement on the fingerboard and the third pitch is now sounding much more in tune. Here, this pitch is flat or too low. When performing this set of arpeggios, the third pitch was out of tune. Here the sound quality could be improved with this highest pitch in the set of arpeggios. The violinists made one error in pitch when playing the descending portion or second portion of their scale. Again, they quickly corrected their mistake and are continuing on with the remainder of the scale. Here the intonation was a bit off and then the finger placement on the finger board was adjusted to get this pitch more in tune. Again here multiple strings are being played instead of one. The violinist went back and played the previous pitch leading into this pitch and that helped them to be more successful at getting a clearer tone. You could tell that they made the necessary adjustments with their bowing, adjusted the weight and the angle of the bow to help them get a clearer, more rich sound on this highest pitch. Here the intonation was off after shifting. Again here, two strings are heard at once instead of just one string in one pitch. It would help to adjust the angle and weight of the bow so just one pitch is heard at a time. Again, when performing this pitch at first, the intonation was a bit off, but then the violinist quickly adjusted their finger positioning on the fingerboard to improve the intonation. Here the intonation could use some improvement. It would help to practice this set of arpeggios note by note using a tuner while watching the left hand fingers and making any adjustments with their placement on the fingerboard as needed to get this set of arpeggios more in tune. Here the violinist performed their ascending section of their minor scale with pitch accuracy and again a legato articulation. They are playing using full bow strokes which is helping their notes sound smooth and connected. Again, here an extra string is being played due to the angle of the bow. Here the tone is very thin and not as full and rich. It would help to put a little more weight in the bow and adjust the angle to get a more full tone here. Here the violinist had better intonation after shifting and you can see their left hand fingers are curved over the fingerboard. Again, here the bow angle and weight distribution can be improved to avoid playing an extra string. It would help to practice the note before the shift, leading into the shift, using a tuner while looking at the left-hand fingers and making any adjustments with their placement on the fingerboard as needed. Again here an extra string is being played due to the angle of the bow.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

As we look on this attempt of the players left-handed reverse mic and layup, we can notice on the right frame, the players body momentum is slightly taking him towards the left away from the basket. And as we look on the left side of the rim, we can notice that the player did fairly well at having his follow-through hand going towards the direction of our target. However, since the players momentum is bringing him away from the basket, it does not allow the ball to generate the accurate amount of power it needs to hit our targeted area, which is the top left corner of the box on the backboard, allowing it to go past slightly on the top of the box, causing it to bounce around the rim, going outside of it, resulting in a missed layup attempt.

The player also does really well at having his left offhand leveled with his follow-through on his release, being able to provide a shield from opposing defenders, being able to, or allowing them to have to come across his body to try to contest or block his shot, potentially putting pressure on the referees and resulting in a foul call.

Right here standing straight up, kind of got to have a little lean forward, but he's standing straight up which is causing the ball to have to travel quite a ways. If he were to lower his base and pound the ball, he would definitely give the ball a shorter space to travel and also be able to explode a little bit more to elevate up and get the layup in the box. Right here, he's going kind of over the top, like a little hook shot roundabout layup. These layups, you want to be able to have the ball close to your chest, securing it with two hands, then powering. Remember, the best time or the best way to get to a place, the fastest is a straight line. So you want to make sure that ball is shooting up, versus going around about.

This arm was lifted up. Nice job holding the balance there. Again, up to here, hitting all those accent marks on the end as it gets faster, but you hear the very clear accents of the music and she hits each part perfectly and then ends really lovely with the arms stretched out. Eyes are straight forward, her body is straight, legs are out, and legs are straight as well. So really nice job overall. So here she is low to the floor, her knees are bent, and she's rotating this right leg, the right knee in as she reaches her arm, her right arm kind of down and up. And she's low to the floor because the next part she is actually going to be on the floor. So nice job staying low here. So this dancer, again, great job with the turns, spinning around all the way and keeping the body nice and controlled in her movements as well as her arms. So here, another time where I felt like she had a really great body control with this layout. The leg is almost at a right angle to her body. This leg is slightly bent. The foot is flat on the floor. Arms are extended out, reaching out, and her eyes are looking up to the ceiling, as you see here. So really nice job in this moment. And she really holds this pose and holds her balance in this movement. So when she comes down to the floor, I definitely think she could have slid a bit more and really gave a little, used the space to slide out. So it's just not her sitting down on the floor. So whole part up to here, nice job with the hands. She has a fist for most of this part and everything just works really well together. She's staying on the beat and doing the movements full out as well. And here where she lifts up her leg, you see it is slightly bent and the toe is pointed for the most part. She can definitely point a little harder so it's just a straight line. But really nice job up to there. So up to here, again, nice job with the footwork and when she leaned down, her body went fully down to the floor and then came back up. That's because she had a nice space between her legs, her knees were bent. When she dropped down, her hands were on her head. So really nice job up to there again. So beginning she steps out with her strong arm reaching out and with eye contact of the arm. And then here she extends her arm around and really fulfilling all of the music. So really nice job in the opening. So up to here, nice job with the footwork just now. You can see each movement very clearly. So she's really good at making sure to do all of the steps to completion. So here, really nice job in this stance. Arms are stretched out high. Body is nice and long and straight. And she is up on the balls of her feet and eyes are forward. And definitely up to here, she does a really great job at taking her time in the movements. Even though the music is a little fast, she's hitting every single beat, every count with her hands and her body and not really trying to rush through any movement. So really nice job just paying attention to all the little details in her movements. It's up to here, nice job of staying to the music, nice space between the legs, knees are bent, and really a job just staying on the beat with all of the accents with their hands. So here in the turn, this is one of the first moments where I noticed how great her control was. When she spun around, her knees were bent slightly, so that definitely helped her to remain grounded as she spun around, and then she really controlled and slowed her body down perfectly to land here and facing the corner. But really nice job in that turn. It was really beautiful.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I would encourage this dancer for the step-step touch to plie even more so then they can use their hips on a pendulum swing. Here I will repeat my earlier comments about grounding, about hip articulation, about power and strength through the movement, about using the back and extending through the arms, all of that wonderful stuff. I think this dancer could articulate their hips even further and swivel them, and they can do that by, of course, pli\u00e9ing their legs so they have more range of motion to be able to move those hips.

I would encourage the dancer to think deeply about their arm placement. It seems like one arm is moving and then the other isn't. So making sure that both arms are moving consistently or over-exaggerating that you only want one arm to move. I would encourage this dancer to really plie through their legs to have more grounding, but also to really deeply do some work about musicality, embodying the rhythm. It seems like they know the rhythm, but they're not truly embodying it. So really practicing those isolations, just moving those hips to that music, moving that torso and that rib cage, those shoulders, that head, those knees and those legs, so they can all work in unison to really create that musicality, that embodied musicality. I would repeat my previous comment regarding musicality. Here, I would encourage the dancer, again, to think about musicality. Their feet is moving to the rhythm, but their hips and torso are not. So this takes away from the dynamic quality of the movement. And this is labeled advanced choreography, which I don't think it's properly labeled. This appears more of a basic choreography to me. I would encourage the dancer to pli\u00e9 through their legs. If they pli\u00e9'd more, they would be able to sway their hips and create a more dramatic feeling in this choreography.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So here he's moving side to side. He does a little better at picking up his feet but just not as much. I would definitely say maybe bend those knees a little bit more and really get the hips into the movement going side to side. They should be also pushing side to side as well. So, not bad with this one. He definitely gets the basics of the movement, just he has to pick up his feet when doing this style of dance because everything shouldn't be so flat and weighted to the floor. It should be much lighter and a bit airy and up on your toes, bending your knees, but just much lighter in the movement. So here the dancer is starting with his just doing the same rhythm. So the one, two, three, one, two, three. One thing I noticed is he's keeping his feet on the floor. So the only time he picks it up is the first step, but then his toes remain on the floor and he's just moving from his heels. So definitely getting those toes up. It should be a step, step, step, not just picking up your heels to and like bending your knees more. Your knees are still bent, but he has to pick up his feet off the floor. Do she or tap, tap, tap to get the correct step. So I do like his turns. He definitely did a nice little spot with his head in the first turn and whipped his head around to get around. I think he might have went on the wrong foot to go back the other direction. I think he just needed to, when he steps forward, step right back on his left foot so that way it's already stepping back and he can easily spin around. He took kind of an extra step so he ended up stepping with the other leg so it just wasn't as smooth as it could have been. So he's now stepping forward and back. Good job rotating those arms around. And then again, I would say, yeah, pick those feet up just a little bit more because they're just kind of dragging and it brings the energy down to the floor. So here again, the only time he picks up his foot is when he's stepping out. That's when his foot actually picked up off the floor. But this toe should also move off the floor when he's stepping on his left foot. But otherwise, good job with his arms rotating those around and staying on the beat.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Now it's important that the climber focuses on the limb that will be forcing the stand last, which is the right foot. So once the climber gets to shift his center of gravity to be over the right side, once gaining sufficient height and the climber presses on the right foot, then that will help the climber have more force when going up for the reach. The climb will start until the climber gets to place his hands and feet on the wall and he's no longer touching the mat. In this case, the climber is starting at a two-hand hold start. The hands being placed on donut holds, meaning that the climber is able to place his fingers on the inside of the hold and wrap the thumb around it. The thumb will help him create some pressure to sustain the grip as a pinch. And the feet position on the wall will help the climber to push and create pressure in order to raise his core or his hips against the wall. That way the climber will then have to sustain his body weight when sustaining the holds on the wall. If the climber was going to do this again, he would consider swinging a bit more forcefully before executing the leap, meaning that the climber will need to make sure that once he brings his chest over that he is more in the air, gaining a certain height before pressing on that right foot in order to make the reach up to the hold. When holds are new, they usually need to get a chalk up. So in this case, the climber has attempted this climb before and knows the area where he will need to place the grip. After some time of trying it, the pores might have run out of chalk. So the climber is re-chalking with the chalk sock by smearing it over the areas where he will need to have grip again. The climber has pressed the right foot and in this instance has brought the direction of his hips already going away from the wall. This will make it hard for the climber to obtain friction or gripping power when reaching the hold. That's if the climber gets to reach the hold. It's important that the climber lets the hips follow the direction of where the chest going into the wall was performing before at the leap. So if the climber slightly waited to gain height, then the climber will be able to have a more successful reach. Here, the climber keeping the arms extended applies pressure on the grips. And he's keeping his center of gravity low. This to transfer the weight as he swings left and right to the feet that are placed on the wall. In this case, the right foot is the one that is placed the highest. And in order for him to create swing momentum to go out left, he will be pressed down on the right foot. And if he swings out to the right, he will create pressure onto the left foot. In this moment, he's building momentum by swinging side to side to commit after creating energy to go up for a dynamic move to the next hold. The next hold is a distance. So the climber right now needs to focus on how he supports his weight over the hands and feet. And right now he's aiming up to see exactly in which area over the edge he wants to go for. Once the climber is ready, then he will commit to make a dynamic stance. This one to be a leap since that's at reach. And then execute the move as he makes his movement up. Doing so is important. The climber brings his chest towards the wall so that the hips can follow. And when he brings his center of gravity with him and the direction that he needs to, then he will have an easier time going with his right hand to place it on the hold above. He does the same thing down below. This is the foot placement for the right foot. So make sure that the climber has enough chalk to create gripping power between the rubber of the sole of the shoe and the hold. As it's porous, the climber then will be able to get rid of anything that might seem to be slippery to make it grippy again.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

It's not just loosely flopping around. It's aiding her path up the wall. So, does a good job in her starting position of really loading up the feet so that she can stand through them. But not only is she just standing, she's also kind of pulling in as she moves. So, she's standing up with her feet and kind of pulling herself in with her arms. And that kind of coordination is going to help her make the moves more smoothly and keep tension throughout her whole body. Here we can see she's kind of doing this back leg, so she wants to be opposite pose, but she isn't, so she's right hand on right foot. So this left leg is kind of coming back behind her and balancing herself out so that way she can kind of reach up smoothly. The only thing I'll say about it is she starts to move and kind of comes off from the wall and that's when she finds this balance point. So what I'd like to see is while she's still, before she makes her left hand move, she gets into this position and then moves through the position.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She can make this more energetic by moving them even larger to side and side, just being more lively in total. And the dancer can dance with more energy make this turn more exciting if she really whipped her head around whipped it fast She is getting around and she's spotting forward right in front of her, which is great. It's technically very good But you know, she's turning in a slower Motion around instead of something that's faster and more exciting. She's still in rhythm with the music It's not her actually going ahead of the music that I'm suggesting it's just having a dynamic of whipping her head around and then saving the rest of the time for the Footwork that she does once she gets around The dancer is spatially dancing well, taking as much space as she goes forward, returning to the center, and then the same amount of space that she does backwards. So the entire dance sequence here, forward and backwards, is taking up the same amount of distance. The dancer's hips movements here are really focused on going back on the diagonal and this way she's not bringing her feet too high. She's not really going up and down with her feet such as a march. Instead, this movement is focused more on her hips and her shoulders alternating horizontally side to side. When the dancer starts with her right foot, her right shoulder also goes to the right. So she's having opposition with her hips going to the backwards corner to her left, but her shoulders are alternating going to her right. So she's emphasizing the same shoulder as she is foot. And that is great here. She's creating a bit of a zigzag with her body, and that's proper execution. The dancer can make this forward and back basic salsa step that she's executing very well. It's more exciting if she added in some stylistic elements. Maybe if she leaned forward with her torso when she went forward, or if she shimmied her shoulders, or if she added in some type of arm choreography. Again, everything is executed very well, but it's not as exciting as it could be. When the dancer does these crossover steps, she's crossing over her feet, extending out, and doing it the same thing the other direction, crossing her feet over, extending out. This can be a more exciting part of the choreography where she could add in some dynamics. Rhythmically, she's executing this dance step perfectly, but everything is very monotone. Everything is always one, two, three, five, six, seven, and she's not really adding any artistry or any extra energy in it, and she could do that to make the dance just more exciting, but execution-wise, she's doing it very well. The dancer's hands are very fluid. She is not holding her hands in fists. Instead they're relaxed as she brings them alternatively up and down, alternating. The dancer's rhythm is great here, stepping on counts one, two, three, holding count four, stepping on counts five, six, seven, holding count eight. She's alternating stepping on her feet from right to left and that's a really great execution here. Overall, the dancer memorized the entire routine and executed it very well, but she was contained while doing it throughout. The dancer's eyes spot forward so that when she's doing this rotation around, she's already focused on where she's going to end up. We see that she's spotting the curtain right in front of her, so she doesn't get dizzy and is able to complete that full 360 degree revolution. The dancer is executing the side Cuban step with great rhythm in pairs of threes. She extends her left foot out on count one, right foot stomps and toes to the center count two, both feet come together on count three. She does the same thing onto the alternate side as well. And when she steps with her foot, say here she's stepping with her left foot, her left hand goes up as well with her right hand lower. So with each foot she's stepping with, that respective arm is higher. That is also properly executed. When she steps with her left foot, her left arm is higher in the air. When she steps with her right foot, her right arm is higher in the air. And they're alternating up and down in this way. When the dancer steps with her right foot, she's moving her hips on backwards diagonal to the left. And when she steps with her left foot, she's moving her hips on backwards diagonal to her right. Her execution in terms of her hip movement is also very good here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He ends up kind of trying to get the top of his toe. He just isn't able to make the heel work. I think that's because of the hand placement. But he commits to it, which eventually does cause him to slip because he can't really toe hook from that angle or toe scum on there. And so he ends up falling off. Now even when he's on that foot, he isn't slipping off of it. It looks like he's pulling quite hard with his arms, so he doesn't look super relaxed and not really taking the weight as much to his feet. So to start he looks good he's really keeping his arms straight not pulling his way through at the moment but then the first thing is it seems like he's kind of trying to get as high as possible right away which causes him to kind of put his right foot matching his left hand which is gonna cause a match in the future so he could have got matches feet on the lower hold where his left foot is currently and then got his left foot up right away and save himself a foot movement. So I like his thought process here with this high right heel. None of the feet are really set up to push down. His bottom left foot's on the slopey undercling and this is kind of the next handhold. The move he's going to is this kind of blocky pinch which isn't the most positive. The only adjustment I would make is, well one, I like that he's staring down the heel hook as he's making it. If I was him, I would kind of move this right hand to the left and be on this left-hand side of this hold right about here. Just so he doesn't have to bring his arm around. Right now you can see he's kind of setting his heel on his hand which is going to kind of complicate things. Then for the second move, he's kind of towing in and he is towing and looking at it so that So good for him for like really staring down this foot and getting this foot because it isn't undercling So it's gonna be quite slopey on top, but he's kind of towing in on the left side Where there is that spike? But I think with towing in you can see just how like high he has to get this toe and just how much his knee is Kind of coming out. So I think the move here would be to throw a heel hook on there And really pull your hips into the wall because you can see just how far his hips are out away from the ball", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Hope to see more consistency for the rest of this video and it's looking like a 6 or a 7 proficiency score right now. Made the first rep, missed the second rep, he was a little long on the backboard right about there. So, we'll see if on the third rep he corrects that. Good, so I say he made probably 65-70% of those. Great technique, looks comfortable, but he could get up to the 8 range with increased effort and just overall aggressiveness in the layup and kind of more game-like effort. First thing I noticed, he's dribbling into his reverse layup and on both sides you can see he's looking up at the basket which is great. You have spatial awareness of where the basket is and also you can figure out where the defense is. So, pretty advanced so far. One thing that sticks out to me is he looks comfortable with the ball. The dribble is comfortable, the movement is comfortable, he's loose. A lot of times you see beginners are a little rigid with their movements, rigid with the ball. He keeps the ball moving. Here he has it tucked in to his inner hip, so keeping away from the defender, and then he's gonna bring it out and scoop it with his right hand. So pretty good so far. See on the left he hits here on the backboard. Solid three, four inches out from the white square. You need to put spin on this ball to get it in. So I predict he misses this shot. So good technique from him so far, but maybe not the experience and repetitions to kind of possess the touch and skill to make this layup consistently. He takes his 1-2. Pretty nonchalant on the left here. That left foot's not that high and this right foot should be driving himself up to get more power. But on this left side you can see his hand placement is good. It's kind of like a hook type of layup, which is good. Gives him the right extension and angle at the backboard.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This was so the climber is able to adjust the grip accordingly to make sure that she's able to sustain her weight on the grip. Now as the climber has extended the left leg and is behind the right leg, this is called back flagging and it helps to transfer the weight to the right foot being in place. Now the left leg being extended helps the climber also to keep her center of gravity close to the wall and close to the areas of support. And in this case the climber is keeping her left side close to the wall. As we can see the climber has stepped off from the mat and places the feet onto the wall. Once the climber is no longer standing on the mat then the climb starts. Her first position was to apply pressure onto the grips where she's able to transfer over the weight to the grips by leaning back and pressing onto the feet. The climber then raises the hips. If the climber was to attempt this again, it's important that she tries to transfer over the left hand when the right arm is extended so that she can continue to apply pressure onto the right foot being in place. Also, it makes it an easier transition when the weight is already being bared over the hold. Simsa's climber was engaging too much into this forceful pull up to apply her weight over to the grips when making the adjustment of the left hand coming into place. So much the climber was engaging into the core and slowly was retracting the left leg being extended and quickly has lost pressure of the right foot being in place. Now this will be difficult for the climbers to sustain to bring the feet back into place so now the climber will be touching the mats since she's so low ending the climb. The climber is starting at a one hold start where she places both of the hands on the same hold. This is called matching and she is placing the left hand over the right hand. This is potentially because the climber when making the move will be keeping the left hand in place to the start hold to then release the right hand from its place for making the next move. The left leg being extended as a back flag helped the climber stabilize the move as she was performing the next move of sending the left hand over to a match at the pyramid. Now this one being flat we can see how the climber is placing it over to the left side of the hold and cupping the hold in order to create friction of the skin towards the hold as she needs to close the grip. The climber is engaging into a forceful pull up to create more pressure. The climber in order to make the right hand up for the next hold, she has twisted her body slightly over to the right by bringing the right knee in. Now this helps the climber to carry over the weight to the right side and release it so that she's able to make the right hand placement as she pushes down on the left toe against the hold to perform the body movement. Now she also needs to send her right shoulder up in order to gain distance from making the reach. Now the type of hold that she's sustaining is a pyramid shape where it's flat at the top so the climber is placing the palm towards the top area of the hold and tries to wrap the, potentially the index finger and the middle finger around this edge of the hold. So the climber is bringing the thumb over to the other edge that is facing her. This is so the climber is able to create more friction of the skin towards the hold and in closing the grip the climber then can create pressure to stick the hand placement. The climber in bringing the left toe application and having the hands crossed realizes then her body position would be accurate to place the right foot so she is readjusting the grips so that they are one next to the other. Now the type of hold that she's sustaining for the grip, this is a jug as the climber is able to wrap the fingers around the lip of the hold and to engage more power into the grip the climber will be placing the thumbs underneath the hold to then squeeze onto the hold to create pressure.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He isn't able to kind of keep the tension through his feet and so he kind of cuts his feet and swings out away from the wall. It's kind of right off the bat, it's kind of a small detail with this left foot. Looks pretty angled so he's going to have to maintain a lot of tension against it. As you can see his leg is kind of, his foot is kind of perpendicular to where the positive edge is. So as he moves up it's going to be a little bit harder to keep that foot on because it is having to go in at that angle. And then not sure if the route ends here if this is part of the moves But if this is the end is that master you can see he's kind of setting his toes up here So he needs to kind of replace his his feet his hands with his feet That's using these like to kind of double toe hooks so that he can release his hands and kind of it's called a bad hang so he's gonna have to kind of flex his toes down and use the top of his shoes to grip this hole so he can go hands-free and move his hands both down to this hole down here or Maybe the row continues, and I don't know the rest of it. Whatever reason yeah, this this move is kind of interesting and Not sure it looks like maybe he just doesn't have enough toe rubber on the shoes I made that twice slips out because overall looks like the the hold is pretty good and positive in the feet are in good position And he looks engaged on it And you can see as he kind of gets higher on it, you know, as his foot kind of starts coming more at a downward angle, and he gets kind of more spread out, he does cut his feet and is able to keep that tension on there. So that's kind of good on the rail setter, is kind of having him move away from that hold and have to force him to use a higher hold. You can kind of see them eliminating that hold. So he's going to have to kind of go from being in a spread out position to a more scrunched position.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I do not think this is the beta. I think the climber needs to go big and bump into this hold right hand. And the root setters here are creating indecision through this boulder because this hold on the right is probably better than the one down here on the left and it's higher. But this hold dictates that you use it with the right hand unless you're much stronger than the boulder. And so I think that the climber is getting themselves in a position that they're not going to be able to progress through. and utilizing a deep drop knee here and posting the left foot and smearing into the wall, climber is able to go up into this right hand pinch. You'll notice the climber came out of the left hand crimp and decided in the end to pinch this hold. A pinch, you can oppose a hold really well on a pinch. Some people are stronger in pinches and some people are stronger in crimps. It just kind of depends on the person. And the climber attempts to bump up into this hold and just falls out. But again, I think going big and bumping right hand into this pinch and then possibly crossing through into this jug is the way. And the climber just messes up, has some bad beta, and falls as a result. So here you have the climber starting cross-matched here. They're trying to really utilize the most ideal place for their right hand to go. This is a start hold with implication. I'm going to start position with implication. They're going to have to use this hold for other things in the future, but it's also just the best place to have the main hand here. So that's a good reason to start crossed. So they're able to very delicately get into this left hand and now they're attempting to actually reverse pinch it and get into sort of an undercling which is very difficult. So here you see the climber matching feet again and dropping a heel on the start hold here. This is the beta for this boulder, crossing back through and getting this heel. So Climber rolls out left, opts to crimp this hold here, and they're currently in the process of matching feet.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Instead of keeping the same ball change triple step, she's kind of adding or taking away some of the steps so it's not as clean. So even though she's explaining the steps and this is it's not really on the music, it's still basic choreography and she still wants to make sure that every step is being done correctly. So keeping the same pattern with the ball change triple step would definitely help to just clean this one up. So here, I would note that maybe the arms should not come up so high when they rock over to his left, her right, just because it blocks her face. So maybe keeping those arms down a little bit and keeping that level there and still rocking the hips without having to move the arms so high up. So here out of the triple step she goes into a turn and spins her around. Nice job keeping the hands together even throughout the turn and then her coming out and having a nice space between them for her to spin out of. I would just note their heads are facing down a little bit, at least hers is facing down and her eyesight should be straightforward. I'm giving eye contact to the partner just so they're on the same page. So here on her triple step, her feet are a little loud, so definitely going up on the toes and bending the knees a little bit more so the movement isn't so heavy because it's not meant to be as heavy of a movement. So here they're just doing a bit of pre-flow with their arms and just continuously rocking side to side except they are now separate so it's nice that they have good eye contact across from each other to get the same movement in the arms, the same flow in their bodies as they are separate. So here, it got a little mixed up because she was still trying to ball change triple step and he was still rocking back and forth. So again, thinking about who is leading the movement. Again, traditionally, he would be leading the movement, but for this, I think she is because she's doing most of the talking. So he would need to follow her to make sure they're on the same movements. So the dancers start rocking just side to side shifting their weight to each leg back and forth. They are holding hands here and then she has her hand on his shoulder and his hand is on her waist as it is done in partnering. So here when they come back together, that should have been another triple step just to finish out the movement. I think he was trying to do a triple step and she was trying to rock side to side. So again, that's that connection with your partner that you want to have to make sure you both are doing the same movements. They're doing a good job keeping the triple steps nice and light. They can definitely go up on their toes a little bit more, maybe bend the knees a little bit more just so they're even lighter in their movements. So here, as she's saying, they're shifting their weight back and forth, but the ball change and the position they're in now, so the standing leg is firm on the floor, the other leg is, the toe is on the floor, and then they do a triple step to the side and then a triple step coming back, and then a ball change again.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And as that elbow started to stretch open, the climber brings in this left arm, and they are able to hold this circular swing, which is great. It's nice to see this dyno get done this way, and a really good initial setup for the climber, and definitely a good grab on this target hold. Climber is then able to campus out into this double scoop jug and this is a great hold. You can see the laser pointer here. So it's basically just jugs to the top after this dyno.

I don't know if they forgot, if he forgot what he's supposed to be doing or if it's just because he's kind of in a weak, he's just kind of weak in general, his muscles are not super strong. He's not keeping a good frame. This dancer is keeping a great frame so you can see he's got this great upright posture and he's able to use his muscles to pull the leader towards him. You can see from this position that this dancer is really, really weak in the upper body, and that's a big reason that he's not a very effective follower. This is, this posture, his posture here you can tell is a little bit kyphotic because he's gazing towards the floor a little bit. This arm, the position here, the angle here, and then this, the position of these joints look super, super weak, so it's unclear, it'll be unclear to the follower what's meant to happen. This is also a really weak position. Typically, when the leader is facing away from the follower, but they're holding hands in this way, typically the leader's hand is fully flat on his own shoulder to keep it really strong in the foundation. This bend of the wrist here in the air is not a strong foundation, so once again, the leader is not very strong, and so the follower is having a hard time following. I also, again, suspect that the follower's not used to following, so it's compounding, and it's making them look really, it's making them be really uncoordinated with each other. Good coordination with the feet again. So once again going back and forth They kind of have this one down this back and forth one two, three one two pretty well down Especially when they're in this open position Really low strength again through this arm You can see this hand is just barely even touching this dancers back a good leader will have a flat hand on the back and Will gently push forward when they want the dancer to their follower to go forward and will gently release back a teensy tiny tiny bit So that this dancer is really clear what the leader is asking them to do Just these fingertips on here is not going to be a strong enough cue to really make this follower feel Comfortable that they know what the leader is asking them to do once again gazing at the floor and one is gazing up This dancer really needs work on the posture again And if they're gonna gaze at the floor, I recommend one they have a straight spine and two they both do it Okay, so in this moment, this dancer did a good job leading by offering the hand to the follower and the follower took it. So that was a good choice and a good execution of leading and following correctly. They are mirroring each other with their feet finally, so they've recovered from their kind of mix-up that's happened over the last 32 counts or more. So here the leader is attempting to do this turn and I think the follower does understand what's meant to be happening because he's not really moving very much here so I think he can tell that what's supposed to be going on here but this dancer is doing this in a very weak way. Really poor posture here through the upper spine. He's looking up but it's creating this kink in his cervical spine because the thoracic spine is so curved forward. Both shoulder positions are super super weak because they're stretched out in the front and so but not because he's engaging through here it's just because he's weak through these muscles and so it's really hard for the follower to follow and it's making the follower sort of have to be the leader here because he's so weak. Once again, they're doing very different steps from each other. He's doing these half-time steps. He's doing more double-time steps. They're both quite weak through the arms here, but especially this dancer gazing towards the floor here, really poor posture, not connected with each other at all. I mean, they are connected with each other to some degree, but not enough. A little bit better weight shift here. So this dancer is shifting the weight back again. And this dancer is more back, but he is on his way forward again, which I can see in the shape here with his torso and his weight moving forward onto that leg. So a little bit better with the weight shift there, but not fully there yet. So it's really obvious that they've switched leaders here for some reason, which is not typical at all in this type of dance. It's very obvious that he's now leading because he's bringing his arm out. It's very strong, and he's the one that's initiating the movement. Great. So this, the leader here is moving the follower into a turn. And I can, I just want to point out that this hand is not even on the dancer's back anymore. So the leader is leading the turn from this arm only. I will, that is not good technique. Good technique as a leader is, at this point, I would expect this hand to be still fully on the lower back. And he'd be using it to push the back forward while he's asking his dancer to turn. So this leader really needs to work on being very clear about his directions. So here they both did one, two, three, one, two, three with their feet, which was coordinated with each other but they're totally off from the music. That didn't really fit with the music. And I mean, even if it did, even if the one, two, three, one, two, three fit, could fit with the music they did not fit it with the music. So there's no relationship to the music in this moment. And that's really unfortunate because swing is really all about the music. It's kind of derives from some African dance forms. It's related to tap dance and tap dance is very much its own musical instrument. And so their relationship to the music and the foundational swing step is totally missing. And that's a reflection of really poor technique. It appears that they're just, okay, I know that I'm supposed to do this choreography but they're not in relationship to the music. And that relationship to the music is actually the most important thing about this style of dance and about most styles of dance. And also their relationship to the foundational step is like the second most important thing. And they don't have that relationship. They do have that relationship to some degree but they're really not cultivating it. I do think the weight shift here is pretty good. I can tell that they're both kind of putting their weight into their back outside foot and keeping their arms really strong. So that's one key point towards the better positive for them. I also like that they're both looking towards each other and keeping their gaze upwards. This dancer really needs to work on strengthening his back though because what's happening here is he's got poor posture through here. And that's partly why he keeps looking at the floor because when there's poor posture through the thoracic spine it's natural for the cervical spine to wanna go forward too especially because the head is heavy. But when he knows that he has to keep his gaze upwards what then happens is then he has to crook this way through his cervical spine and it looks really weak. It's also contributing to a weakness through his leadership in this dance because he's breaking his shoulder joint here because he's got such a kyphotic curve through the thoracic spine. And when we break our shoulder it prevents us from having a strong leadership. But even if we're a follower when the shoulder joint is smoothed out and broken in this way, when I say broken, what I mean is that it's not coming straight out from the spine because there's no strength through the rhomboids holding it there. So it just rotates forward, rotates forward. It flexes forward. So that prevents him from being a strong leader. And if you were a follower, it'd be really hard for the leader to tell him where to go because only the arm would move because there's a break in this connection here. So this dancer doesn't have that problem at least in this moment. He's very strong through the upper spine and the rhomboids which is holding the shoulder really well. So I have a feeling that a lot of the problems that are happening here are more to do with this person not leading very well and also this person not used to being a follower. Once again, not coordinated. This dancer appears to be lagging behind. So this dancer has kicked the left leg forward. And this dancer is about to kick the left leg forward. But that actually doesn't make sense because in a partner dance, typically you're mirroring each other. So again, either they're forgetting the choreography or they're not leading and following correctly. So here this dancer has kicked the outer leg forward and this one has instead stepped on the outer leg. So again they're not coordinated with each other. So I know that this person is meant to be the leader because before they started dancing he said I'm gonna be the leader. They asked each other and he said I'm gonna lead. So this leader, either the leader is not doing a good job of leading, the follower is trying to lead, or they were supposed to do this very, or there's a choreography where they were both know that they're supposed to do a kick here but maybe he forgot. Either way it's whatever the cause it's not coordinated. I mean as partner dancing, as partner dancers they should be doing the same thing as each other or facilitating each other doing something different from each other. So here they are finally coordinating their steps. So they're doing a kind of basic swing step, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, three, one, two. And they're doing a good job of doing the same step backwards and forwards as each other. You can kind of see that in this moment that their inner foot is, their weight is on their inner foot and their outer foot is stepping back. They're not fully together though, still. So you can tell that because this dancer's foot is fully off the ground, whereas this dancer is moving towards putting his foot on the ground. Another thing is that they're facing in a strange way. Like this dancer seems to be facing more towards his partner than this one. And once again, you know, gazing towards the floor is not helping them. You know, a confident posture and a gaze forward or gazing at each other would help a lot. So somehow they got opposite of each other here, meaning one of them is doing like the first half of the swing step and the other one's doing the second half. So this dancer is doing one two three and this one is on the one two and that also has to do with the shape of their feet. So the step should be open on the one two three and then crossing behind on the one two. So they're both technically doing this step correctly because they are going side to side on the one two three and then crossing on the one two but they're opposite of each other so one's doing the first half the other one's doing the second half and I think this again goes back to being in relationship to the music and in relationship to the foundational step at all times. If they were both doing that this wouldn't happen. This dancer is good at recovering from mistakes, or so far has done a good job of recovering from mistakes, including in this moment. So they were just doing this kick sequence. It was unclear what it was meant to look like, but they were not coordinated with each other. And this dancer was able to recover. Actually, that's not true. I was gonna say he was able to recover because now he's doing the same foot work as the other dancer, but he really should be doing mirroring the other dancer because they are in a partner dance. I get the feeling that maybe they're both used to being leaders. And in this moment, this dancer is the follower, in this piece, this dancer is the follower. And I think he may be getting his feet mixed up because of that. Because typically, not typically, whenever we're doing partner dancing, we're always mirroring each other. Otherwise you would step on each other, which is why when one dancer is going backwards with the left foot, the other dancer is going forward with the right, for example. So I get the feeling that they're not, he's maybe not used to following. And so he's mixed up which foot he's supposed to be on. They did recover from their mistake, however. So just previously, this dancer kicked the right leg forward and back, whereas this dancer kicked the left leg and then the right leg forward. So I think that maybe one of them forgot the choreography, but they recovered quite well from it. Actually, this dancer recovered well from it. This dancer just kept going, but this dancer, who is meant to be the follower, did end up following correctly and recovered. And I can see that because now they're doing the same step as each other mirrored. So that's great. Again, just looking at the floor and this posture forward is not good. It's just not good. If I were a... Well, I am the audience. I'm seeing the tops of their heads. I'm not seeing their smiles. I'm not seeing their faces. Now, if in this particular moment, this is what's meant to happen, meaning looking at the floor, what I would want to see is a straight spine so that it looks intentional. And is a shape of some sort. This kind of hunched over posture with the gaze down is not a shape and does not look intentional. So here they've done a few steps forward. They are coordinated with each other, which is great, but they are not coordinated with the music. Those steps forward were not on the beat. Once again, you know, this style of dance is very much about the music, and they've totally missed that. Once again, neither of them have returned to the basic foundational step, but you know, they don't always have to do 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, which is the basic swing step. They could be doing 1, 2, 3, 4 at times. It should still always be in relationship to that foundational rhythm. But regardless, neither of them are in relationship to the music whatsoever. They're just sort of both randomly stepping on whenever they can to get to whatever they're trying to do here. So it really drops the whole purpose of the dance, which is to emphasize the music. Or, you know, at least to be on the music. And they're not on the music at all. Good job here. So they're going back and forth with this one, two, three, one, two, and they're quite well coordinated with each other. Great. I love that this dancer is trying to keep his gaze forward. This dancer is still looking at the floor, however, so I would recommend they choose one or the other and if they are going to look at the floor to have a straight spine. Once again, they're not coordinated, they're not doing the same footwork as each other. The leader is really, really weak here in this sort of strange, like, rotated position. So once again, just emphasizing the importance of coming back to the basic foundational step at all times when you're doing a social dance of this type. This dancer is doing that. So he's doing a good job. He's going underneath the other dancer's arm and he's doing the basic swing step, which is great. But this dancer is not maintaining that. And so that's going to create this imbalance of rhythm between the two dancers, which is partly why they're not well coordinated with each other. And if they could both always go back to that basic foundational step, it would go a long way towards making this whole piece look a lot more coordinated. And now they're having another confusing moment, and that's because this leader is not leading very well, very strongly. He's bringing this arm around, but the follower doesn't quite understand what's meant to happen here. And that's because the leader did not push him in the direction he wanted him to go. He's bringing this arm back behind him, pretty strong here, but it's not very obvious because of the way that this arm came around, it's not obvious to the follower what's meant to happen. So again, they're not well-coordinated here. Again, weird, weird, small little mincing step happening here through this weight shift. It's probably a small mincing step because he's shifting his weight back at the same time that the leader is shifting forward. Once again, they are not coordinated with each other whatsoever. What needs to happen is they both need to be shifting back at the same time. They're not even doing the same step as each other here. So once again, really poorly coordinated between each other. So once again, not coordinated here with each other. This dancer also is not even stepping on the beat at all, and they're totally out of sync with each other. And again, comes back to doing the foundational step and coming back to that foundational step at all times. One thing I want to point out too, is that this is like the fourth repetition of this side to side step where they have not been coordinated with each other. So it's taking them a really long time to recover from their mistakes. Maybe they don't even know they've made a mistake or can't really tell they're not well coordinated. And that's a big problem. Anytime you're doing a performance, you need to catch your mistake really, really quickly, and you need to correct it really, really quickly. They're taking way too long to recognize and correct their mistakes. Again, not well coordinated. So this dancer has kicked the right leg forward and now is currently kicking it back, whereas this dancer kicked the left leg forward and then the right leg forward. So they're not coordinated here again. So either they're forgetting their choreography or they're just not leading and following correctly. So good. So here they're quite coordinated with each other. They're traveling on this diagonal and they're sort of alternating these steps with this sort of rocking motion. And they're doing it opposite foot of each other. They're staying connected on their hands. Looks really good in terms of the footwork. But once again, poor posture and gazing towards the floor. This really very much detracts from any success they're having down here with their lower half of their body. It looks weak. It looks like they lack confidence. There's not a whole lot of interest for the viewer. So, you know, any success they have here, they've totally lost it up here. I really recommend, especially this dancer, strengthen through that spine, keep the gaze forward and confident. This was much better. So this is the second time they've repeated this 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 with a turn. Much better, more well coordinated. They seem to be on the same page here. This is the ultimate example of how they're not coordinated, or I shouldn't say it that way. This is the ultimate example so far that shows that they're not well-coordinated. They literally bumped into each other here. So they're out of sync with each other. They're not doing the same step as each other. This dancer's not leading very well. This dancer's not following very well. You can tell he knows they messed up here, that they're bumping into each other, and it's for all those reasons I just listed. So here this dancer is looking side to side really quickly and it seems as if that's because he doesn't know what he's meant to be doing. They're just not coordinated with each other once again. So they've kind of started dancing here. The music has just started and they've kind of started dancing, but it's really unclear whether they've actually started or not, because it kind of looks like they're marking their steps. So I just would encourage them to be really clear that they are starting and actually just launch into it and use exaggerated big movement. They're both looking towards the floor, which is not professional. It's not a good performance choice, typically, especially for this style of dance. I mean, in like a postmodern or abstracted style of dance, okay, maybe in certain cases, but this is not the type of dance where looking at the floor is a good idea. I don't know if they're looking at the floor because they're uncomfortable with their steps, or it sort of looks to me like at least this dancer might be in this poor posture because he thinks it like makes him, because he thinks it looks cool. And I can tell because in the moments before the music started, they were both kind of just warming up a little bit. And he was looking at the floor, even in that case, and kind of swinging his arms in a way that's like, this makes me look like I'm confident and I know what I'm doing and I'm cool. But like, no, it doesn't. So I would just recommend that they look up. Once again, they've both lost the foundational step here. Neither of them are doing one, two, three, one, two. This dancer appears to be trying to do a one, two little step here, but this dancer isn't really taking that cue. And maybe that's partly because he's supposed to be the leader. So again, really poorly coordinated here. It seems like neither of them really know what they're supposed to be doing here. But even if they don't know what they're supposed to be doing, they're not recovering well. Again, they're not doing the same step as each other. So this dancer has just done a basic swing step one and two. Well, the first half of a basic swing step, one, two, three. And this dancer did one, two. And he's on the wrong foot at this point. So that's because this dancer did three steps and this one only did two. And so he's ending up on the wrong foot. And I know he's on the wrong foot because in a partner dance, they should be mirroring each other. So in this moment, this dancer should have the weight on the right leg and the left leg in the air, but he's doing the opposite. And that's partly because he did the wrong step. Because it should be one, two, three. One, two, three. Well, this dancer did one, two, three. And so this one should be doing one, two, three. Instead he did one, two. And again, I think that maybe he's used to following. And so I think he, excuse me, used to leading. And so by this point in leading, he would be on the left foot. So he might just be, his mind might just be putting him on the wrong foot because he thinks, oh, I'm supposed to be on that foot. So he might just need more practice following over time. And you know, another thing about partner dancing in these types of ways. So swing is a very particular type of social partner dancing. And pretty much all social partner dancing that is formalized such as swing, you're basically doing the basic step the whole time. But then you're doing variations on that. But you should always be able to come back to the basic step, especially if you are getting off from your, if you're getting, if your coordination is not perfect with your partner, always best just to come back to the basic step because you both know that that's your foundation. And neither of them are really doing that. I can tell that they've like learned this choreography. And so they're just trying to do the choreography rather than, okay, everything comes back to the basic step, whether it is the basic step or a variation on the basic step, or just being on the rhythm of the basic step. And I don't think either of them are doing that. Otherwise they would be much more well coordinated. And the leader would be even more strongly able to lead the follower. Yeah, so he's now leading for some reason. That's a really inexplicable choice. He kind of was sort of back leading the whole time, but now he's just obviously leading. So he just turned this dancer who's now the follower, but this dancer did not do that turn very well. He's like flailing, literally flailing here to recover from that turn. And I think it has to do again with a weak frame through the shoulders so that this dancer is really strong. And so he quickly turned the other dancer's arm, but because his frame was so weak, it's really thrown him off balance. And also why is this person leading now? That doesn't make any sense. Again, not well coordinated here, so this dancer has stepped across his body and is moving to the right, whereas this dancer is sort of just staying in place. I think he's not taking the leader's lead very well here, and that's partly why they're not coordinated. So good, now they're coordinated here. So they're both doing a kick with the inner leg, the leg that is closer to each other. I might suggest doing something interesting with the arms. You can see they're not coordinated with each other. This dancer has a bent elbow and this one has a sort of relaxed arm. So, you know, this kick could be really nice if it was accentuated by some sort of arm movement, maybe straight out from the body or in a V shape or something. It's just the arms are just not helping emphasize the movement, which is fine if they were just partner dancing for fun, you know, at a party or club or something. But this is supposed to be a performance. So I might just say let's add a little bit of interest with some arm movements here too. Once again, really poorly coordinated. So this leader has, was on, his weight was on his left leg and has now transferred it to the right. But that is not coordinated with this dancer shifting his weight back onto the right. So either this dancer shifted back too early or this one is shifting back too late. In order to make this successful, they both need to shift their weight backwards at the same time, because then that creates a counterbalance. This dancer is in a really great dynamic shape for that, but it's not, he's not able to fully reach his potential here because this dancer is also shifting forward. So what's happening is they're both shifting in this direction, but you know, what was meant to happen was shifting in the opposite direction of each other to create a nice counterbalance. Again, this kind of curve through this upper spine and shoulder is making him, this leader, be in quite a weak position. So that's preventing the follower from making a really nice big shape. He's doing, this follower is doing a great job with this plie and this push back through the pelvis. He's just not being counterbalanced well by his leader. Again, no relationship to the music, no relationship to each other in terms of the footwork. Better weight transfer here. So they're both shifting their weight backwards, which is creating a nice counterbalance. This dancer has reached that in a little bit too quick, sharp, and heavy, not heavy, but strong of a way relative to this dancer. So just I would recommend they work on their dynamics a little bit. If it is going to be a sharp movement back, then this dancer needs to do that too to really improve this counterbalance. This dancer really needs to work on keeping this shoulder really, really strong, this frame. You know, in social dancing, we think about the frame of this part of the body, and he's not holding that at all here. So that might be why this dancer is having to work extra hard to bring this back onto his own weight because he's not getting a great counterbalance and strength through this dancer's frame. Again, gazing towards the floor here, it just conveys a lack of confidence and a lack of sureness in what they're doing. They are coordinated with their step here, which is good. They're doing the same step as each other. They've done a good job with these last eight or so counts of staying coordinated with each other. They're both doing a one, two, three, one, two, three, and they're both doing it on the same beat. They're going opposite of each other, mirroring each other, which is really great. You can see in this moment that they both have their weight on their inside leg, and then they're coming back on the ball of the outside leg. So good job staying well coordinated here. I think part of why that's successful is because they're looking at each other, and so they're able to actually make eye contact and coordinate in that way. Yeah, if somebody doesn't know who's the leader, if the partners don't know who's leading and who's following, that's going to just again compound the fact that they're not coordinated with each other or with the music. You can see that they're just doing different steps here now. They're just really poorly coordinated with each other. I don't know if it's because the leader is not giving good signals here or whether the follower is not taking the signals very well and is maybe trying to lead, but they're not even doing the same step as each other here. You can tell that because their feet are in totally different positions. So the leader is facing towards the follower with this leg and this one is sort of off the floor in this direction. I guess this one is towards the leader, so maybe this inner leg is well coordinated, but this dancer's got his opposite foot behind him. So they're just really poorly coordinated with each other. Again, hard to tell in this moment whether it's because the leader is not leading well or the follower is trying to lead, but either way, they're poorly, poorly coordinated with each other. In this moment, what I would expect to see if they were coordinated would be that their feet would be mirroring each other in a partner dance. Simple posture here for this dancer, kind of arching through here and then this way with the cervical spine. I would just really encourage him to work on having a nice straight back. So now this dancer is coming through here and because he went really quickly back with his weight shift, he's rebounding way too quickly back into this dancer and they actually almost hit each other again.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So again, my recommendation to this pianist would just be working on consistency and keeping that same kind of energy throughout all of your playing. All right, one thing that is sometimes helpful with those over repeated patterns or notes that go over and over is instead of just Playing so just previous to this he was playing the thumb the one on that note just over duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh and it kind of sometimes it creates a little bit of tension in your thumb or It just you know It makes your thumb tired and so you can drag actually do a drag with a three two one three two one three two one three two one and then It it allows you to To have a little bit more control over that so that you don't have that extra Just so that your fingers don't exhaust too early Alright, so right here, this is closer to where we're wanting that hand position. When we curl those fingers up into that C position, it just allows our hands and our fingers all to touch the keys at the same level so that we're not extending and touching at different spots. And so it just gives us more control over the notes that we're playing. So as we go through that quick phrase right there and then the little turn you you have to have those curved fingers right there and so My recommendation for this pianist would just be to work on consistency and trying to keep that finger position consistent throughout your playing Alright, so up here in the right hand as we're playing all those he has a really nice rounded hand position Everything's going really well. We can kind of feel that He's doing a nice job Alright, the pianist has really good posture and hand position as he's starting. He has, you can tell he has a command over the keyboard the way that he holds his hands and through this repeated rhythmic pattern at the bottom down here, he's really setting that tempo up really strong. So you can see here between the pinky and the thumb, just that rotating back and forth, it kind of allows you to have that same drive and pattern while alternating pitches so that you're not feeling that tension in your hands. So on some of those trickier phrases, he has a really great finger position. And so it's just inconsistent, but the more that you work on that and strengthening those fingers and forcing yourself to play in that good technique and hand position, the more consistent your playing gets. So he is doing really well. There's a lot of syncopation in this piece, and that driving bass rhythm, and all things are going really well. Okay, so the pianist is slightly inconsistent with his Finger position on the keyboard so you can see with the left hand. He's a bit more extended here and Just previous to this he did have his hands pulled up into a nice, you know a little tighter with that C position and It just helps you to stay more consistent with your tempo and Overall phrasing of all of the The the parts that come out and so we don't want to be over We don't want it to be too loud or too soft We want it to all be balanced in there And so kind of bringing those fingers up thinking about finger position will help with overall consistency", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So kind of again on this dino, he's starting good position, his arms are nice and straight. He's looking up at the hold.

And just bring his hips close to the wall and then spring from that position to get this hold up on the rail. So you can see just the distance that he is From the wall where he lands shows just how much his momentum is kind of going out away from the wall and said up the wall And if he kind of missed it and fell With his hips in the right position would expect him kind of probably land more in this area way closer to the wall But again, we can see as he, one, as he jumps for it, his body needs to be a little bit higher. And part of the reason is that he's not higher. This is going to feel kind of like the apex of this movement because his right foot's limiting him. It's kind of turned now into the left. And so that foot is applying pressure like this, which is going to send him, it's going to try to send his body that way. So this is really limiting how much movement he can get off of this right foot.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He's really trying to offer that to her here, and he's doing a good job with his strength through his arm as he shifts his weight back. And she's, I think, maybe a little nervous or scared about getting herself off balance, even though he would be there to hold her. So that'd be something that these two can work on is, number one, trust, and then number two, what does it feel like when they're both holding tension and their weight is going away from each other? That would create a lot more dynamism to the movement and also actually give her more strength through that tension to move wherever he wants her to go next so that she doesn't have to do it on her own. It would be the momentum created by that tension and that weight counterbalance that would help move her in the direction he wants her to go. So here they're just doing this kind of side to side step. He's got his hands on her mid back or lower back here and she's chosen to lift her arms up in the air and then bring them down onto his shoulders. Again, very pedestrian looking. It reminds me of watching some people at a school dance or something kind of swaying side to side and the one person just kind of casually lifting their arm. So it again, looks quite amateurish. So I would say either don't do that with the arms at all or make it even more intentional by maybe straightening the elbows, energy out the fingertips and then making a really intentional looking arc around to the shoulders would give it more of a performance quality rather than just a rehearsing or casual quality. This is a nice moment. They've turned away from each other. They've let go of their hands. This is a really good example of a great way to use the arms. They're both really well extended through the arms all the way from the shoulders out to, well I'll talk about her fingertips in a moment, but let's look at this side. The shoulders, the elbow, the wrist really well aligned. Lots of energy out through the fingertips. Same thing for him. Everything's aligned. There's a lot of energy coming out the fingertips. Her weight shift looks really good. She's quite strong on this plie. Nice extension through this leg. I love that they're both looking towards each other. It's really, really nice. Normally I would want to see this as a straight wrist, but she did a really nice little flick of the wrist downward that looked super intentional and actually added to the line. So I think that this is a really good example of how to use the center of the body, energy coming out the limbs for the intention that you're trying to make. So what I'd encourage them to do is replicate this feeling in their improvisation. So they kind of lost each other, right? So he pulled her in and she turned her body. So she was facing this direction and he was facing this direction, which was clearly not meant to happen. She was meant to face him. And then they had this awkward moment of kind of stepping in place, which was not a great recovery from that. But she did this nice little improvisation moment where she was like, let's try to make it look, well, I don't know what she was thinking exactly, but it seems to me as if she may have been thinking, let's try to make this look intentional. So I'm gonna do this little back arch thing. So I think that was an interesting choice. She's got a great arch through her back. She's a very flexible person, which is one reason, again, she needs to work on her core strength, because if you're naturally a flexible person, you need to get really strong through your muscles or you can get injured. Anyway, point is she tried to recover here. However, the problem with that is that she's not the leader. And so the leader has already moved on to something else because that's his job is to tell her where to go or communicate with her where to go. And she went off and went rogue. And so they're now, again, even though this was an attempt to recover, they're even more disconnected than they were before she tried that. I think here I'm glad that she's again using her whole body. She's got her arms straight up in the air, but again, looks really, really pedestrian and amateurish. We can really see this hyper lordosis through her lumbar spine, and that's because she's not engaged through her core, which is part of the reason it looks pedestrian. Great job with this leader really offering. This is such a great freeze frame here, because you can see him just, boop, he's offering his hand there to say, okay, let's connect now. And I think he's doing a good job of that. Again, though, I really would want to see him using more of his body, a little bit more energy out this hand. Again, lack of core strength with this dancer is meaning that her movements are all coming from the joints of her body and in this moment, and also preventing her from isolating the joint or the part of her body that I think she's trying to isolate. I don't think she has a lot of experience in isolation, which is something that you can learn from something like a jazz class. Isolation means really being able to just move one body part at a time. And typically, we work on moving just the cervical spine, the shoulders, the thorax, and the pelvis at different times. So I think what she's trying to do here is isolate her thorax with her arms in the air. But it's obvious she doesn't have a lot of experience doing that and doesn't have enough core strength to really pull that off. And so again, it's looking very, very pedestrian, like someone who doesn't have a lot of experience. And there's nothing wrong with her not having experience. She just needs more experience and more technique class, more strength through her core. But it doesn't make me want to watch her as a viewer. It actually makes me feel kind of uncomfortable as a viewer because, again, looks like someone who's a beginner trying to pull something off that she's not quite ready to pull off yet. Again, though, I will give her that she's trying to move her whole body and she is moving her whole body. Whereas this dancer, he's moving his arms a little bit here, but he's just lacking energy. He's really not pulling any energy out through his body unlike her. So she's at least putting energy into it, whereas he's not. So they're really not very well matched in this case. Here, this dancer is now moving the hips side to side. Again, lack of core strength is a problem for her because as she's moving her hips side to side, because she doesn't have a lot of core strength, she has to, she doesn't have to, but what happens because of lack of core strength is that this whole area moves as a unit. And so it looks very stiff rather than this smaller area being able to move as a unit, which would look nice and loose as an isolation. She probably hasn't had a lot of practice isolating her hips, and so she's moving a bigger chunk of her torso at a time, which makes it look very stiff. She's in this very, very wide stance, which is also a super awkward and very weak position. You can see that her knees are actually collapsing inward, and she's pronating through her feet, which is not good form at all. She's, it's very hard to move from this place because there's really no strength in it at all. And that's another reason she can't be nice and loose through her hips. You can get, if she had her foot right underneath her hip, meaning like right in line with her hip, if her hip, knee, and ankle were in line with each other and she did a nice plie and strengthened her core a bit, she could really move those hips in the way that I think she's intending to move them here. She's doing this little running step again. It just doesn't fit with the style. It doesn't fit with the music. Not much coordination or strength through the core. It looks really kind of floppy. He is trying to use his arms here again so that's good. I'll give him that. I'd like to see more plie so he can move his body more. I'd like to see more energy out the fingertips. So here the leader did a good job of bringing his weight back and keeping this arm strong to create a weight counterbalance, but she didn't really follow his lead super well. I would like to see her let herself let her weight go a little bit. She's kind of keeping her weight really centered, which usually is a good thing, but there are certain cases like in this moment where it would have been nice if she would have allowed her weight to be back on this foot while the weight his weight was back on this one a little bit more. That would have created more tension between the arms here so that when he pulls back toward himself he would really be pulling her rather than her having to put a lot of effort into moving in that direction. Here they're really not connected with each other. I think he's attempting to look in her direction, but they've kind of lost any connection they had initially when they started this improv section. And so any kind of sexual tension that they were trying to portray is kind of dropped here. And even if they weren't trying to portray that, the connection between them is dropped. So that was actually helping a little bit, and now they've lost that aspect of it. She collapsed inwards here with these arms coming in. That's going to be really hard for them to reconnect. It is really hard for them to reconnect. They almost smack into each other here because she brought her arms so close into her body rather than having a frame that he could latch onto. And you can see he's trying to latch onto her here, and he's about to, he's kind of pushing her away from him because he's, they're going to hit each other if he doesn't. So, so as she comes in toward him, she needs to set up a frame so that it's easier for them to connect, a nice strong frame with her arms. That's a good little section. They're doing this forward touch, back touch little section with this open position, which is nice. But again, here in this moment, she's starting to lead again. And you can tell that because they're not on the same, well, they're on the same foot, but they should be mirrored. So if this were what was meant to happen, he would also have this foot behind him in this moment. But she's chosen to take the lead here for a second or longer, potentially we'll see, which is not a good idea because we can't confuse who's leading and who's following because you will get uncoordinated from each other. So here she's not taking his lead very well. It's like she, it looks like she wants to keep holding this position out, but he's trying to pull her in. And she's kind of forcing him to lead her, to follow her here, which is, it can be very confusing. And I know there's, we could certainly critique partner dancing for the follower, leader, man, woman types of roles that are required or that are typically asked of people. But in this case, she is the follower. And so if you're choosing to be the follower, you need to let the leader lead, because it gets really confusing. And then you often will get uncoordinated from each other, because it's unclear what's meant to be happening. Really, again, weakness here through the neck. As she's coming backwards, she's really extending her cervical spine. It just looks, again, quite weak and quite pedestrian. So this dancer especially is struggling with this improv section. It really looks like he doesn't know what to do with his arms and again it it comes across as awkward. So here again, they're doing this side to side movement. This dancer really lacks coordination and control between the various parts of her body. And I think that's again, cause her movement is not coming from her core. And so right here as they're going back and forth in this movement, she's moving her hips, she's moving her shoulders, she's moving her head and they're kind of all going in different directions as each other. And so again, is giving this sort of pedestrian casual quality to it. It looks very unprofessional. She doesn't really have any frame here held with him and he's trying to hold his frame, but I think he's having trouble cause she's so, so close to him. And so, you know, she just really needs to work on strength and coordination between her limbs. Although he looks like he's having fun, so that's great. So this beginning section, the dancers are very obviously improvising. They are both dancing, but they're not partnering yet. They're just dancing individually at the same time as each other. It's clear that they're attempting to convey a sense of like sexiness or sexual tension, partly because that's what the music is sort of conveying with the rhythm, with the instrumentation, the saxophone being the main instrument, and also with some of the movements, especially this dancer's movements. So that's good. At least they're being intentional about what they're trying to say with this piece. My biggest critique though is that they're obviously not very experienced dancers who are now improvising. And it's never a good idea for a beginning dancer to attempt to improvise, because it's very obvious to the viewer that they're not experienced dancers. And so it's not very interesting to watch. In fact, it's a little tiny bit like uncomfortable to watch, because it's like you're watching just any person move their body, rather than a professional or someone with excellent technique move their body. And so, but it's in a performative way. So it's kind of uncomfortable for the viewer to witness. Couple of things in particular that make this look like inadequate technique. One is that they're both looking towards the floor. That's a clear sign of a beginning dancer or someone with little confidence in what they're doing. Another thing are these, this tension through this dancer's wrists. It's much easier to see in this camera angle here. So you can see that the wrists are flexed inward. There's some tension through the ends of the fingers here. Lots of tension through the whole hand here as well. And that's a sign that this person is either not fully aware of what's going on with their arms or is a bit uncomfortable with what they're doing, not super confident in what they're doing. And so they're holding tension somewhere. And for this person, it's here in the wrists, even a little bit through the bicep here as well. When there's not a good extension from the arms, that's a pretty telltale sign that someone is a rather beginning dancer. This dancer is taking really big steps here. It looks like what she's trying to do is make a jazz square. Jazz square is when you step with one foot, cross the other foot over, bring the next foot back, and then the next foot over. So what it ends up making is a square shape on the floor. It appears that's what she's trying to do. Her steps are just way too big. And so what's happening is it looks really clunky, awkward, and stiff because her steps are so big. Part of the reason that the big steps are making it look clunky is that when you take a big step like that, you have to have a straight knee as you step across. It would be really hard for her to take such a big step and land on a plie. And when we land on a straight leg, that's always going to create a reverberation upward, which makes it look stiff because it is stiff. Another thing is that she's not on the ball of her foot here. And so that flat foot is also going to give a sense of heaviness and clunkiness. So those are a couple of things in this moment. But in general, this improv section is pretty hard to watch as a viewer because they're clearly not very experienced dancers. And so it's very awkward looking. It makes the viewer feel awkward. So they're not on the beat anymore here. It's taking a long time for them to recover from the previous moment when he brought her back in and she thought he was going to turn her, but he wasn't. They still haven't quite recovered from that moment, and so it's led to them here not being on the beat anymore with the music. Here they've come from this counterbalance position and now they've come in towards each other and you can see that they missed each other here. So I think what was meant to happen was that she was supposed to be facing him in this moment. So I think that he didn't lead her exactly where he wanted her to go. I think she probably thought that what he wanted her to do was a turn. So just really being clear with your follower about exactly where you want them to go would go a long way for this dancer to be more successful. Again with the improv same critiques as before there's not much arc to it not much phrasing to it It looks quite pedestrian not a lot of energy through the whole body at least for this dancer He's doing a better job this time trying to incorporate his arms But still we I'd like to see more energy coming all the way out the fingertips more core strength here more coordination of the limbs So here again we can see because of her lack of core strength she's actually fallen and caught herself on this leg and that's because she doesn't have enough core strength to hold the previous position that she was in where she was facing this way. Now they're back in another improv section. Again, it's not effective. It really looks too casual, too pedestrian. You know, a lack of shapes with the arms, a lack of an arc. They're not really telling much of a story. There's really not much phrasing in what they're doing here. So again, I would recommend don't improvise until you have more experience improvising and more experience as a dancer, or improvise but keep it really, really, really simple. Thank you. Just another general critique of this section, this improv section here. Good improv will have some sort of an arc to it. It doesn't have to be a story or a narrative or anything like that, but it has to has to convey something and bring the audience on this sort of a journey and that could just be imitating the phrasing of the music. Simple as that. They're both on the tempo of the music, but they're not really in relationship to the phrasing of the music and they're not creating any kind of arc with their movement. They're just sort of randomly doing different moves that they think of in the moment and even though that's what improv sounds like it is, that's not actually what improv is. Improv is crafting a story or crafting a it's not necessarily a story, crafting a phrase in the moment. Crafting a choreographic phrase in the moment and they're not doing that and so it just looks like again random people just randomly dancing. It does not look like a performance. So I would recommend they do not improv until they're more advanced dancers and have more experience maybe even taking classes in improvisation before they try to improv on stage or don't do improv at all in this choreography. Just do choreography that is set. So, good job here of replicating the previous moment on the music. So, the music has this sort of ba-dap horn moment. And before, they were facing this way, and they did this, pretty much the same moment with the previous time that the horns did that. And now, they're doing it again. So, I think that was a really, really good choice musically. Again, I didn't catch him in the highest moment of his arm, but both of them did a really good job with extension through the arms again, plie to the side, nice weight shift. I actually like his leg here better. It has a sort of jazzy feel than the previous time he had it flexed. So, it's a nice jazzy feel that they're both doing here. They're still gazing towards each other. Really, really nice choice. So again, this is a really awkward section here. She's still trying this jazz square. And now I'm realizing as I'm watching that I think he's also trying to do a jazz square. He's just not doing it in a very pronounced way. One thing I will give this dancer is at least she's trying to dance with her whole body. Compared to him, he's really not doing that. He's mainly just moving his legs. His arms are very pedestrian. This frame almost looks as if I just took a picture of somebody walking normally. So he's not using his whole body. At least she's using her whole body. He's really just focusing on the feet. And he's doing it in a very slow, not slow, small way. And so it's again coming across as very pedestrian. She's doing this way too big with her feet. Compared to him, her footwork is way too big. It's making it very, very awkward. One big critique for this dancer is she lacks core strength. And I can tell that because as she stepped around here, she wasn't able to keep herself upright. She actually collapsed down, which is what we're seeing in this moment here. It again looks really, really awkward. It looks really, really stiff. Another thing is that the reason I, not the reason, I'm pointing out this lack of core strength because what it's leading to is the way that she moves all her limbs is not emanating from her core. It's emanating from the joints of the body. And so it's making it look very haphazard. It makes her movements look sort of vague and unintentional. Again, makes it look very pedestrian because she's lacking a foundational aspect of a good dance technique, which is core strength.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Her weight is way too far back here for this to be a very successful move down into the floor. It would have been more helpful if she had kind of driven her sternum forward while keeping this angle here with this front leg or even making the angle a bit more acute. So yeah it's important as we're coming down into a fall to bring the weight a little bit forward. It just helps it be more controlled and smooth. Great job here. So what she did was she plied with both feet and then pushed off of the right foot to land on the left. Really nice leap. This is a great line here with this plantar flexed foot and great job bringing these arms up really quickly and nice and high with straight elbows. This is one of the best attacks that she's had the whole time in terms of the texture and dynamics of the shapes, so I'd love her to embrace what she did here and try to recreate that in the whole piece. The reason that this is really effective is because she had just come from both legs in this orientation facing downstage, but and then this elbow bent straight up and quickly turns in this hip, internally rotates this hip, and brings this arm really quickly out with a nice blade and a nice straight elbow while maintaining the shape here, and then looking away from this arm actually helps to make a nice counterbalance. One reason that she is effectively able to turn this hip in so quickly is because you can see she's using the ball of her foot as her pivot point, which is a really great mobile pivot point so that she can do this really quickly. Good attack here as well, bringing this arm behind her head and this one on her hip. She's on the music and she really did attack it to begin with, which helps her to get here quickly so that it reads as a shape. So better attack here, this is an example of a good attack. She's brought this arm out and around like this by internally or externally rotating her shoulder. However, it does look stiff, partly because she's holding this arm really stiffly in a non-specific shape, and partly just because there's a stiffness through her spine and her cervical spine as well. And so unfortunately, even though she achieves a good attack here, she's doing this movement in a very stiff way, so it doesn't quite come across. So it looks like she's attempting a body roll here, but I don't think fully understands how to do a body roll. She's really pushed her pelvis forward here and is quite forward on the balls of her feet. A little bit of an arch through here, but very again stiff through the cervical spine. This would have been much more effective if she had started by looking upwards and started the body roll with the cervical spine and then all the way down to the pelvis. Again, quite disconnected between the lower half of her spine and her cervical spine. She's done a good job of making a shape here, but she drops it way too soon and so it doesn't really read as a shape. And also she's, I think she's a bit hyper flexible through her shoulder and elbow, and we can see that, can see how far back her shoulder is relative to her head, and then her elbow is slightly hyper extended in this direction, hyper extended, and so it it kind of loses its strength. So she needs to work on keeping her muscles really strong around her joints here, hitting the shapes before dropping them. It's also a little bit stiff because she's not landing in a soft knee here, she's got a little bit of a bent knee, but it's it's quite held quite stiff, and so as she's coming around with this shape, rather than making a nice stillness, it's like a stiffness. Plus she doesn't hold this shape long enough. So these arm shapes are great. She brought these arms up in a fist and really good job following through across the body. Really nice. I like that she's using a plie. However, it's really quite stiff all the way from the pelvis to the neck. So the spine is very stiff from the tailbone to the top of the head. And that's partly because her weight is really far back here, but she's holding a stiffness through this or a straightness through the spine. And so it creates a stiffness through here. And then, so that could be effective if she were looking up at the ceiling and her spine were in alignment all the way up to her cervical spine. This could be more effective of an image. But she still has her face and chin quite jutted forward. So this and this make the movement look stiff and detract from the nice pathway that she made with the arms. This is another really great moment for her. She stepped onto the ball of this foot, pushed into the other foot to bring it back, while bringing the arms down and up in a really nice, strong, clear V shape with energy at her fingertips. She does do a good job of staying on the outside of her leg, which is a good aspect of techniques with the technique of falls here. This is a great moment. She does hit this really well. Nice attack, nice deep plie. I like the hands coming to the thighs, but there's a stiffness here through the neck that I don't like. I would prefer if the spine would stay straight all the way through to the top of the head or maybe even looking down with her head with her cervical spine. Again, she's not quite very well practiced in keeping her whole spine connected from her tailbone to the top of her head. This is another transition moment that's really awkward for her. She's a little bit frozen in this shape before moving into the next moment. This section looks really weak, especially in the arms, because she's thinking she's moving the arms only from the elbow down in this up-and-down position, which just looks technically incorrect. I think this would be a much more effective movement. I know it would be a much more effective movement if it were more exaggerated, maybe came from the shoulders or from a plie if she had kept her arms still and just done some quick plies up and down. I think this would look a lot stronger. Again, just low, low, low energy. It's not very interesting to watch. She needs to exaggerate her movements more. She's got more, she's got plenty of music to do what she needs to do here to make this interesting. So finding places to be staccato, finding places to contrast that with legato movements, some stillnesses, things like that. She's just, it's, she has the mechanics of the steps pretty much correct, but she's missing that layer of performance. This turn is also very weak. She's not in any kind of a strong position here. She basically has her knees kind of glued together, which is not a strong position whatsoever. She didn't prepare by pli\u00e9ing with this leg to transfer her weight into this one, and so she's turning by moving her shoulder and her head up and around, which is not an efficient or nice-looking way to turn. Also her pli\u00e9 is way too deep here, so it just looks awkward. Again, not enough attack with this movement and her gaze sort of and head sort of staying stiffly in this position is not helping her, which because it makes the arm, basically the only thing moving is her shoulder joint, which obviously that causes her arm to move. And so what that does is it really makes it look disjointed, uninteresting, there's no energy, there's no attack in what she's doing. So again, technically she's doing the mechanics of this shape correctly, but it really lacks texture and so it looks very weak and low energy. This is a pretty good start to this movement where she's got a nice deep plie here. Her arms are really strong with the hands on the back of the head and she's starting this spinal articulation from the lumbar spine upwards, which looks really nice. Really really weak moment. I think technically she's bringing her arms into the position that they're meant to be in but she's moving really really slowly and it just looks wrong because The arms are the hands are in this fist and she's coming to these sort of straight positions crossing in front of her So it looks incorrect that she's moving them really slowly Because the arm shapes themselves are very sharp. It lends itself to a sharp attack as well So it just looks incorrect Even if it was what was meant to happen it really I don't I doubt it because it really looks incorrect from a viewer's perspective Again, she's sort of just standing there in a transition moment. She really needs to work on softening her knees, actually. If she just thought about softening her knees, that would go a long way towards helping things look more smooth and connected. Right. So because as she came down, her weight was so far back, what that's led to is that as she placed her hand, it's also too far behind her. She's, I think, not used to, probably not used to relying on her body weight going into her hand and more used to it being in her lower half of her body, which is expected for a pedestrian, but not for a dancer. She really, what would be much better again is if she'd driven her weight a bit more forward, then she could get her shoulder lined up over her hand here to create her new base with the floor. Rather than that, what she's done is kind of kept her legs as her base, which doesn't allow a lot of freedom for movement of the lower half of her body here. Unfortunately, she loses the efficiency and quickness of the previous movements in this turn because she's planted her foot here fully flat and is rotating her body around her hip joint. I would have loved to see her stay on the ball of her foot and use her ball of her foot as her pivot point. Again, just standing here in this transition, not okay. We have to move through our transition. So I just encourage her to find ways to keep doing that. This choreography I think is a bit too advanced for her and that's why she ends up in these sorts of situations where she's not, she hasn't quite worked on her musicality and dynamics enough to pull this off. again quite stiff through the cervical spine. She really hasn't, she needs to work on connecting her whole spine and practicing some articulations from the pelvis all the way up to the head. This movement would have been much nicer as she came down to make a shape like that with the spine coming down and then to roll up in the other direction to come back up. And she does start that, but because of the stiffness here, what she does instead at the last second is she, not last second, but last few moments as she lifts her head to lead the movement the rest of the way. So she misses these lines, she cuts off the lines that she could be making. So it looks like inadequate follow-through and also looks pretty stiff to lead with the head like that. This section also looks really weak because of a lack of attack here with the elbow coming up, and so she doesn't really fully reach a very specific shape with the elbow before dropping it again. And then she just stands here for like four to eight counts. No energy in her arms again, really. Arms are sort of just hanging at her sides. Her feet are really close together, which means that she's not in a good foundational position in order to move. Her knees are also straight. So again, not a good foundational position or to move to the next thing. Poor posture here with this chin sort of jutting forward and slightly upward. And so it's really uninteresting to look at, to be frank, and does not fit at all with the style of dance or with this music. So if she knows that there's going to be like a bar or two where she's just going to have to be still, I would say go back to don't lose the shape you just came out of. That was a great shape or make a new shape and hold it. This is not cutting it at all. It's not performative enough. Great musicality as usual. She's really good at staying on the beat. And so she's really brought the arms up quite quickly onto that beat. But again, I would have loved to see her just hold it for the teensiest second so that we could actually read it as a shape before dropping it. Again, lack of attack here makes it so that rather than this being a shape and a moment of its own, it's sort of a throwaway movement because she's not hitting, she's not getting there quickly enough so she doesn't have time to hold it and make it read as a shape. This section really great footwork and I like that she's keeping the arms pretty simple But held pretty strongly here so that we can just focus on this really nice quick footwork She's effective at this footwork because she's staying on the balls of her feet that really helps her to stay really tight and small and fast Pretty good shimmy here, a little bit stiff. I'd love to see a little bit more loose, but other than that, pretty good shimmy. She understands the basics of how to do a shimmy. Again, she doesn't hold this shape at all, and so she just sort of moves through it, which makes it look very weak. This is kind of what have been so impressive because she just came down, she just came from a low position on the floor, and if she could stand up and make a really clear, sharp shape that would make this much more impressive. Good ending, she's on the beat, she's got a nice straight knee here and here to make a nice strong position. Arching through the back here, too much hyperextension through the elbows, she needs to work a little bit on strengthening her biceps so that she has more of a straight line here and also to protect her joints over time. But great energy out the fingertips and a good ending overall. Even this moment, which looks really good on paper, like this frame looks really strong, she came up into it way too slowly for it to really read as this really interesting moment. It's really nice as we become more advanced dancers to do really big movements really quickly because it's very impressive looking, because it's very hard to do and she's not quite there yet. So, you know, again, mechanically she's doing the steps correctly, but she's missing the texture. What's nice about this shape is that she's really high up on the balls of her feet, which looks really good, a little bit of an arc through the spine here and really strong arms. However, again, she's not putting a lot of energy out her fingertips and that's partly one reason this doesn't quite read very well. This is where she starts to lose her spinal articulation and become quite stiff from the thoracic spine up to the cervical spine and is starting to now lead with the head. I would have liked to have seen her finish that spinal articulation all the way up and bring the head down last to complete that line. Again, she really lacks attack getting into this layout. And so it really, again, just very monotone and monotone is not interesting to watch. Also the layout is not very strong. It's partly because when she stepped backwards to get into it, she kind of walked rather than like ran. And it's really helpful to kind of run, basically do a bunch of tiny leaps to help you get into this to get the momentum going. And she didn't do that. So that's partly why this is not super successful. Another reason is she's not using a plie here. And so as her weight is coming forward with this leg, she's actually pronating here and that's not a strong shape. Another thing is that because she's not plieing here, she can't get a good hinge through her back or good arch through her back. You can either arch or hinge when you're doing this type of movement and she's not doing either really. She's doing a little bit of an arc through here and through her cervical spine, but she misses kind of the overall gross movement of it. The arms are really strong. They did come out and around in a nice arc, but there's really just not a lot of energy out her fingertips. Her whole performance, low energy. And this is one part of that is this kind of lack of energy out of her fingertips here. This feels like a throwaway movement, like a transition moment. She doesn't hold it long enough. It's a nice shape, but the dynamics, she's not hitting it again, not hitting it sharply, and so she doesn't have any time to hold it. So it doesn't read as a shape or a movement or a moment, it reads as a transition. So again, she really needs to work on attack, musicality, and dancing through her transitions. This is a better attack with these fists coming forward than I've seen her do so far, but she does not really hold them long enough for it to read as a shape. She's doing a good job pushing through the hip here because that looks like that's what's intended by this choreography. I do like that she completely releases through the cervical spine here though and is looking back between her knees pretty much. It's a nice deep plie with a nice shape here. Good, so she repeated that leap in a smaller version. Again, really looks nice here. I wish she hadn't started turning her body already though because what that does is it takes away from this shape because it's obvious that she's moving into something else. So it'd be nice if she could have stayed facing downstage before transitioning, but other than that it's a really good strong shape. This is the end of the piece and unfortunately again this is another transition moment that really like drops the energy really low here. I'd love to see if she could again really keep moving through her transitions, use her whole body with energy out all her limbs at all times because this really detracts from her ending here. I can already tell that she's not going to execute this piece very well. She hasn't started dancing yet, but her preparation for dancing is sort of lackluster here, you know, and how we prepare is how we perform. And I can see that she's sort of got her weight on this back foot. There's not a lot of strength in this way that she's standing here so that when the music starts, she's not in a position to really attack the moment. Her arms are just hanging limply at her sides. Her shoulders are a little bit slumping and rolled forward. So she's not prepared her body to start this choreography very strongly. This is a good turn. What she's done is she had her left leg forward and pli\u00e9ed into it and transferred her weight to her right ball of her foot and is rotating on the ball of the foot, which is great. She's not spotting her head, but I'm happy that she's doing this lower part of her body correctly in terms of making the turn efficient and smooth. This is a pretty good moment for her here. It's a nice deep plie that she's come into, great follow through with her arms coming around and up over her head. You can see however there's some tension through the hand here. This one's a little bit better but I just love to see more energy rather than tension so that her fingers would all be coming out straight here. But it's a good shape. I would also like to see her, well it does look like she's looking up at her hands in this angle but over here it looks like she's kind of looking off in that direction. So it's hard to tell exactly but I'd love to see her looking directly up at her hands here to emphasize that movement and also a little bit more arc through the upper spine because that would make this moment look less stiff. Because her weight was so far back to set up for this turn, or fall, excuse me, she's way too tight in with herself here and so she's had to unfold her leg in this way that looks really awkward and unprofessional. This couple of bars here, really great footwork, pretty precise. Arms are totally lacking in shape though, and head again, neck is quite stiff, and so it really detracts from all the great work she's doing down here. So here she's got extra music because she did her turn pretty quickly, which I did like to see that kind of quick attack But the problem with that is she also she clearly doesn't have a lot of experience like filling up her music And so what ends up happening is she stands in this super awkward looking position with this knee turned in here and her arms Slowly moving upward here, but the arms are not in any especially this right arm is not really in a clear shape So this looks like a boring Transition moment, so I'd encourage her to find ways to keep dancing through her music what she lacks is like control And so what happens is rather than having this controlled slow shape moving upward with her arms She's got this awkward like little movement before she begins the next thing Again, in this section, her movements are too small. They're not exaggerated enough. There's not any interesting texture or dynamics to them. So again, I think she's technically doing the mechanics of this, the movement correctly, but that texture on top of it is what she's really, really missing to make this an interesting and dynamic performance. Unfortunately, she compromises her lovely tabletop shape here with this arm. So the arm was straight up, then she brought it down towards her groin, towards her pelvic bone, and then up her body. But this is as far up as it gets. It really looks like what should happen to kind of complete this movement is for that arm to then fully straighten again, either right above her or behind her head, but she kind of has to stop it there, I think because she's running out of music. So it'd be great if she could find a way to maybe attack that a bit more so that she has more time to follow through. Pretty good attack here bringing these arms out nice straight elbows good fist Which is that looks like a fist is meant to happen here, and she's done a good job with the hip coming outward But maintaining a plie and continuing to gaze over her shoulder This is a great little flick moment here with her leg. Looks really strong and clear and quite quick. Again, moving into this position way too slowly, not any attack to what she's doing. And so it's just frankly kind of boring to watch. It's very monotone and lacks texture. So I'd love to see her just attack that movement and then move slowly to fill up her music because that would just make this look so much more interesting. Great moment. The reason this is a great moment is because she took a nice big step onto this leg and is dragging this one with a straight knee back towards her. The arms came out down and up really strongly. Pretty good energy out the fingertips here. This is a very strong tabletop position. She's got her shoulder lined up over her wrist, which is great because right now this is one of her points of contact with the floor and it's important to keep the weight centered. She's also got a pretty good 90 relative almost 90 degree angle with the knee to the the ankle and also has driven the pelvis up so she's got a really nice tabletop shape here. This arm looks really strong as well and helps to accentuate and exaggerate these lines that she's making. So here she started the choreography and as I suspected there is not a lot happening here This is the very first moment of the choreography and she fails to grab the viewers attention She is moving way too slowly here in this moment to really make this Have any interest it really lacks texture and dynamics I'd love to have seen her attack this shape and then sort of slowly drag through the movement Rather than that what she's done is she's just kind of slowly brought her arms up. There's not enough energy It looks quite weak and low energy here You got to grab your viewers attention and she did not do that in this moment for all those reasons the shape itself is fine It's just the way she's getting into it. The dynamics are really lacking Really good attack here. She's done a great job of bringing this arm behind her head very quickly while turning her body position towards her left.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The dancer has there to close up the movement, the somewhat of a pose, and has a very nice stance to close out the piece. The dancer does a great job of toe taps when she does the salsa move and grabbing the head to thrust it forward with the accentuation in the movement. So she uses not just her head with the tilt forward but her entire body and she bends over at the waist. She does a great job of incorporating her turns with the salsa steps and not losing rhythm or count. She goes into bringing her arms up to add somewhat of a flourish to those turns and to also place the arms out away from the body as well as the foot with an extension when she comes out of the turns to give, I would say, a nice presentation before transitioning back into doing the salsa step. So the dancer has done really great with again the stepping, the toe taps, the two-step, and bringing the arms into the movement by raising them up and also doing the shimmying and isolating the upper rib cage and that chest area, moving the shoulders back and forth, alternating on the double count. The dancer does a great job with staying with the rhythm and also with the instruments that are playing in the music. This is a polyrhythm. You hear many instruments. You hear many rhythms overlapping. You hear the different voices. So she's playing with all of that and she did well with moving fast, staying on the counts. You can tell that she kept rhythm and she kept the beat. Here, the dancer begins with what I would say is not a very explosive, engaging introduction. Not so much with the movement, but with the energy. So the dancer, I think, should start a bit stronger to keep that and keep that energy throughout, but also to set oneself up for what they're about to engage in. So I would have liked to see a bit more energy, certainly from this beginning to this point. The dancer here incorporates jazz and hip-hop movements, isolated, sort of popping and locking almost with some of the steps where she is bending and moving the legs inward and isolating the single movements and gestures with the arms and thrusting the arms outward, thrusting the arms in certain directions. On the hip-hop part where the singer is rapping, he's bringing in lyricism and so I think that it's unique to shift in the movement since the music is also reflecting that because the music and the movement are certainly connected and are one and so it's nice to see the dancer doing that in the choreography that they're executing and what they're carrying out in their body. Here she does a really great job of listening to the music and waiting to begin again with her steps. This could have been choreographic where she had a gap in the movement. I think there she could have done a two-step, a box step. There were probably about a good four counts in that moment. She could have done a pivot turn going to the back wall and then turning back to the front. There were some things that she could have done there instead of standing still, especially with something as rhythmic as salsa where you can bounce the knees or the shoulders, isolate the hips or something. Something could have been done there, but she's done a great job of staying with the tempo and the counts and with the rhythm. So this next section where the dancer walks upward on the diagonal to stage left and turns around and extends the leg, I would have liked to have seen a little bit more undulation in the back and release in the upper part of the body, but more engagement in the core. But she actually executed that very well. Then she really starts to engage with the movement and feels more comfortable. The energy starts to pick up. She's moving through, especially with the arms, almost like windshield wipers, the way that she's moving them back and forth and holding the fist clutch. She has a strong bend in the elbow, so she looks very engaged in the movement and the salsa steps are very accurate.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Right here she's circling her arms and she's circling her ribcage counterclockwise over and over again, but these circles can be grander. They can be taking up or have a greater circumference and each of her movements have radiating eccentricities. The dancer is executing all of the steps correctly. Like her footwork is very clear. She is definitely in control of her body, which is so wonderful. The dancer also is able to extend her right arm out while keeping her right shoulder pressed down. So her neck is still elongated here. So that's great execution. The dancer is beginning to glance over to the side of the room towards the mirror, perhaps because she's entering the end of the dance. But even if the dance is soon to be ending, it's even more important that she finishes strongly. So she needs to remain concentrated throughout the entirety of the routine, the end included, so she should be looking straightforward. The dancer just needs to be careful in this position with her balance. Her sternum is pulling backwards a little bit. Her hips are leaned a bit forward. So she just needs to make sure she's aligned. Her spine should be vertical. She shouldn't be leaning further back in her upper body than her lower body. One way in which she couldn't loosen her body here is using her hips and her shoulders Her arms are in a correct position. Her feet are alternating moving Forward her right foot in her left. Her arms are well coordinated Opposite arm is moving forward than her legs. So that's great when she's moving her right arm forward She's moving her left leg forward and vice versa, but She also now needs to use additional body parts namely her shoulders and her hips here The dancer begins to look down here. She should be looking straight ahead. Even though this is the very end of the routine, she shouldn't be losing her focus. She needs to improve her focus here and remain looking straight forward. However, the dancer now needs to loosen up a bit. Every movement that she's doing is so exact and it's technically correct, but she can use more artistry in her movement, just a sense of letting go and looseness. The dancer is doing a great job of being on her toes. She's turning with her heels lifted off the ground. So that's allowing her to complete these turns more swiftly. This is very good right here. The dancer is extending her right arm completely while she leans her upper body away from that arm and her leg is also, her right leg is also in a straight line. So this is really good execution and while she keeps her right arm out and her right leg fully straight, she's bending her left leg purposely so that she could be traveling which is very good.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And one thing that we can see is that they are actually starting to reach around the good side of the hold so they can utilize it. And then one thing we can also see is that this is kind of a very full span move that the climber is having to experience and do. But one thing I can definitely notice about their position here is that because they're hanging on with a right hand, they are forced to use a left foot on this yellow hold here. And then this kind of allows them to use opposite points of contact with the wall so they do get really good control of what's going on with their body. But one thing that I am noticing as they're doing this movement, we can kind of see that they're really hanging back and over to the right, which kind of shows to me that they have a preference of pulling in with their upper body, which isn't always a bad thing. But in this case, it seems like it's pulling them away from their movement because their body is still hanging over to the right. So what I would encourage this climber is to really make sure that they focus on transitioning their body weight over to that left foot. And one thing that we can see is that with their left knee, it's kind of pointed into the wall right now. And by allowing their knee to be pointed into the wall, this further pulls their body away from the wall and over to the right. So then that way, again, they're kind of working against themselves. So what I would encourage the climbers instead of placing their left knee facing towards the wall is by allowing it to be parallel to the wall so that their hip is open. And by doing this, this helps to guide their knee along the length of the wall, which further allows them to stay on that left foot. Because as we can see that as they're committing to this move, that left foot actually did slide off of that foothold there, which is again making it very hard for them to complete this movement altogether. So by allowing their knee to be open and their hip open to the wall, they can further transition their body weight over to that left knee and over that left foot, which will help them overall in their movement.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Here you start to see more right knee pull up, which is really good. Love that he's got two hands on the ball and his eyes and head are up. Great spacing here in relation to his body to the basket. Here in this particular shot, looks like he kind of shot it over his left shoulder. And you can see the follow through is down and to the right. Let's get that follow through up. Let's pivot and face up a little bit better, square our shoulders so we're shooting the ball out in front of us. Again, could have greater spacing between his feet. He is trying to raise that left knee like that he's got his body square and his eyes are up. Again, brings it down low, does step over with the correct foot. You see that stepping, but look how the feet are really close together. And he's just taking a little teeny step. Let's take one big explosive step so that we can lift that hip up. Again, I would love to see more lift and power. Like he's choosing to kind of just kind of tiptoe off this left foot and the right leg's really I can't tell if he's pushing off two feet here, but ideally, you know, I would recommend stepping across with that left, pivoting and really powering that right, pulling that right leg up to lift your body up. I love the arm bar, love the extension of the shooting arm and hand. Again, it could be a lot more aggressive and explosive, driving, you know, this left leg and hip up, not a lot of aggressiveness here, but shoots with the left hand and shoots it with pretty good accuracy here. I start to see a little flexion of the wrist on the follow through, that's what you want to see. Again, I think he has the ability to really power it up more. He's barely leaving the floor, barely pulling that right hip up on the left side, but love how he's got it in his left hand. You want to shoot with that left hand on the left side because you've got defense here on the right. Again, good placement of the ball on the top of the square. Eyes are head or up. Let's get both arms up to rebound this miss. Keep those arms up. Let's spread our feet here a little bit on the landing. But not bad. Again, taking little baby steps. Let's be aggressive. Take one big step over with the left foot. Eyes and head are up. I love that he's got two hands on the ball to help get it up to the point of release. Here, the shooter shooting a right-hand layup. Again, I really feel like he could have more lift and elevation by dropping, bending his knees and really pushing off and dropping, you know, dropping his hips and really pushing off. Here, he just kind of goes from a stationary, standstill, straight-up kind of movement. He's not getting a lot of power from his legs, but I like the arm bar. I love the eyes and head up. I love the extension of the shooting arm. Let's break that wrist and snap those fingers down. But nice footwork, nice shooting with the correct hand. Here again, just a little small step. Let's be more explosive here. Let's keep the ball up high. You've got a defender here. Yeah, you're going to get stripped. We'd love to see him hold this follow-through. The ball, though, is in a pretty good position here to hit the backboard to go in. But let's hold that follow-through up. Here you see him drop it down. Again, we'd love to see a more aggressive stepping through with the right foot. He just takes little baby steps, but a really nice big step that gives you momentum to drive that left hip up. Again, he gets it out of the net, the ball is brought down to his hip level, let's keep it up high. But I love how he's stepping through on his left foot and the right leg is following. And he is definitely, you know, he knows where he is, his eyes and head are up. Here, as he transitions to the left side, ideally, I would love for him to get it out of the net and then keep the ball up high. You see him drop it down here, and you know, in a game, there's defense. You make yourself small when you bring the ball down, so let's keep it up. Keep it up. I love the fact that he is transitioning by stepping through on his right foot. His left leg is going to follow, and you can start to see this right foot turn in, which he's, it's called a pivot. He's going to pivot, face his toes to the baseline, the basket, so that he can square his body to the rim.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

His left foot is on the line of the wood. Instead, his right foot is in between the lines of the wood, so they're not on the same plane. He needs to bring his right foot a little bit more forward so that it's aligned with his left foot on a horizontal plane. The dancer is a bit tense here in his hand. As you can see, his end fingers, his thumb and his pinky are pointing in opposite directions, separate than his three center fingers. So it just shows all that tension in his fingers. So he should instead move his fingers closer together. The dancer also can extend through his head upward so that his neckline is also more visible. The dancer can be swinging his arms here behind him so that he has more momentum in his step instead of holding them at his eyes or stopping the momentum here. Also, the dancer should be turning his, rotating his right foot further inward, and that would come from his hip joint. So if he rotates his right hip inward, then his knee would face inward and his toe as well would face further inward, closer to the left side of the room. And instead, the angle that he is rotating is still inward, but it's only slightly inward instead of being more so. The dancer is in the process of raising his arm here, however his arm should already be up as soon as he does the toe or digs his toe into the ground on his right foot his arm his left arm should already be raised in the air so it's getting it's being raised too late. The dancer's shoulders are a bit tense here. His shoulder blades are raised up high, close to his ears, so we lose his neck line. However, it's really good that his fingertips have energy through them, that they're exuding outward. So that's good, he just needs to close the spaces between his fingers. And part of the reason why it's easy for him to tense his shoulders here is because he's looking downward. We said he sees his hand in the view and also the floor in his view. And so looking downward like that and raising his arms at the same time in front of him creates a really easy recipe for his shoulder blades to be lifted. So it's even more important that he presses them down given all these conditions that are coming together. Instead, while the dancer is using his arms strongly, which is great, he should at the same time simultaneously press his shoulder blades downward so that his neckline can be seen.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And if she would have just kicked to get exactly on that beat, the dun-na-na-na-na-na-na, it would have been perfect. So I would say for this style of step, because it looks a little more freestyle, just trying your best to get right on the music, because I think the technique could be there. Because it's kind of a tap step in a sense, where it's step, shuffle, step, shuffle. But just trying to get like really on the music, so that way it looks and sounds really good. So here she's doing like a nice little windmill with her arms, they're swinging it around. As she's backing up, I would suggest that for her to go up a bit more on her toes, so she's not stepping on her heels but just on her toes, so kind of doing a little ballerina tiptoe going back. And that would also help to stay with the music and give a little more nuance to the music that's being played. All right. So overall, this dancer I think did a really good job. There were some transition issues and some just like improvisation where it didn't really flow. So just thinking about what naturally makes sense for your body will help with improvisation and just making sure everything flows together. But she did a really good job just listening to the music and trying to hit the accents of all of the really nice beats that were happening in the music. So this part where she took two steps and then like march, march, march, again I think using the whole space I think she could have really traveled with that either come down here or come in this direction and then maybe even like actually run out because it was just kind of like I don't know if she just wanted to stop but I think her direction could have changed just as she can do the movements full out. So the first time she did it, she did like a really nice twist going down. The second time she didn't fully commit to it, so it looked like it was a mistake. So I would suggest doing the twist that she just did, where she went a little lower to the floor, repeating that stuff because the music's changed, so that way it doesn't look like you made a mistake. So here she's doing, she just did like a little step, a kick step and then rocking back and forth. I could tell her feet are getting a little mixed up and I think it's because of the way her, the weight of her weight shifts that's happening. So when you are going to kick a leg that needs to go, you need to make sure your weight is adjusted so that leg is able to kick up. So either it is ready to kick up and is already off the floor or it is in a place where the weight is on the other leg so that way the leg is free. So just being mindful of that and I think if she would have just taken a second between movements, I think she would have adjusted herself better so the weight shift would have made more sense. And the movement would have flowed better from one step to the next. So this next set of steps she is stepping and rocking back. She's using her hip to rock back. Also again really nice arm work using the arms getting the full body into the movement. Her feet are, she's falling back on her heels so therefore her toes are coming up and being flexed. And I like that she's repeating this movement as the music is also repeating and then she goes into a different movement when the the words change to the music. So this movement is really nice, but I do think it could have been bigger. She could have come all the way around and used the full space and really just exaggerated that movement because it was a nice, the music has a nice key change and it's changing the melody a bit for that part. So I think making that walk around much bigger, it's okay to use all of your space that you have. And here she's doing a little twist. If you notice her fingers are pointing down. So just something a little different instead of bringing her arms up and down as she's done before. She's also doing a slight level change because her knees are bent and I think she could have even went a little lower just to kind of play around with the levels going up and down with the swivel. So those jumps are really nice and the way she's using her arms, she's swinging them side to side and I thought she would be off the beat but she was able to like just stay on the beat continuing the jumps. She did a nice plie and just paused when the music paused and then jumped right back in so that was really nice. So her dynamic here when she is stepping out, so taking a step and then she's planning her full foot on the floor. It's really nice with the music because she kind of makes this light even though it looks like a heavy step but it's very light to the music and then the next change of the music when it does get heavier she does some really nice jumps. So here I think she could have kept moving around instead of stopping at this space. She could have just kept doing this movement swaying side to side but making a full circle around just to give a little more dimension and dynamic to the step since it's just a rocking step going back and forth. So here I can tell she's starting to get a bit off of the music when she took that step out because I could tell the music changed. You just want to make sure that you are staying on the beat. So one thing I would suggest is just taking a moment like feel free to walk around or just like do much smaller movements so that way you can find the rhythm and make sure you're on the correct timing. So in the beginning, the dancer starts with a really nice level of energy right from the start of the music. She's currently doing the Charleston step where she is stepping forward with one leg and stepping back and then stepping back with the other leg and stepping forward and repeating that pattern. She's also swinging her arms really nicely side to side and they're ended up flying up behind her. So a nice twist from this area of her body. She is also twisting her feet out so her toes are turned out away from her. A really nice Charleston step for the beginning. So here I notice it was a, I could tell it was a bit of a foot and hand mix up. If you notice right now her left arm is in front, as well as her left foot. And that is normally not how we walk we normally walk opposite so I think it would have just transitioned and just felt more comfortable for her if she would have made sure when she turns around to step on the right foot if her left arm is going to be up or the opposite. Thank you. So this part right here, she is playing off of the trumpet that's being played, the trumpet solo and I would suggest maybe leaning back a little more. So trying to get your back back since the knee is already bent and the toe is up, sorry, the heel is up off the floor. So really just leaning into it and then also adding the jazz hands to kind of sprinkle a little extra on there. Don't be afraid to really exaggerate as the music is exaggerating as well. So another time where I think she's using the music really well and changing her movements to the song. One it helps to remember that way because you're able to connect the song and the music and every time the song kind of changes you hear a key change or you hear the words change then your movement changes so it's a little easier to remember. But again she's using her full arms the first time they went up around and up and then the second time they came around and down. So here she's doing like a stepping back and just kind of kicking her foot out. So she stepped back with her left foot and then she was kicking her right and also clapping. I would suggest really if you're going to clap, commit to clapping fully and just watching your balance as you're stepping back. So just making sure you're standing up nice and straight and tall. So here she does a little twist swivel and if you see her toes are pointing in the same direction. So right now they are going towards her right. And her arms they were drawing up and down and up and down to go with the twist. So a nice little different way of doing it instead of just keeping the arms in one place. She was bringing them up and down really nicely to add a little more fun to the piece. So this part right here, she comes out of the Charleston and does a little lean forward. And right now she's leaning back. I really like this moment because it's where the music also breaks. So there's no talking, but there's this nice little instrument playing, and she's moving to that beat of the music really nicely.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Everything that they're doing is really amazing, but they could just lean into doing more and more. These things that they're doing, the left hand with their, this kind of short notes, they're imagining like it's coming from their palm, and it's getting this really nice, short staccato notes. This again is a really nice transition that they take plenty of time and then use that time to prepare for the next spot. Notice that their left hand as soon as they finish that last chord, they got in position for the next one. Just imagine, it's just like they're floating around the piano. Here the subject plays the left hand a little bit too loud, giving the context with all the other dynamics. The subject has a really nice touch with their hands. I think they're also using a pedal, but especially their left hand and this last chord. It felt very much like a soft landing, very gentle. So it really exhibits a lot of great technical control. This buildup section, let's kind of speed up a little bit. It kind of happened a little bit out of nowhere. Could have been happening a little bit before. Just spread it out a little bit further. The singular line that they're playing with their right hand is really nice and well paced and they're doing a really awesome job of being extremely musical and taking their time and it feels very organic. These chords that they're making are really nice, very soft, but also very balanced and even. They're kind of like a nice foundation to play and then everything else on top of it kind of floats around it. The subject has really nice playing, things are very even, but you also notice when they're moving their arms, there's really nice flow between their movement, but also with the music. The section leading up to this has done a really great job of just the sound slowly, slowly starting to dissipate and really demonstrates how great their touch and their handling is and their hand, that they can control it very well. This is a really technical section that they're doing a really amazing job. It's very virtuosic and very, very, very good. The players doing a really awesome job with this, these kind of octaves. Their hand is spread out but it's not too too tense and trying too hard and they have nice, they're using their forearms and their upper arms really well to help get around the piano really well. This shift here, they're taking as much time as they need, and they fit it in musically, so it makes sense. But there's no rush, and there's a lot of trust when watching somebody play like this, because you feel like there's not going to be any mistakes. This is really nice timing with the right hand so it feels like I mean it's very metronomic in the left hand but then the right hand feels very free, very nice and musical.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

That would help the lines and the dimension and allow them to be able to take up more space. In this moment where they're creating this kind of star shape where the one foot is on the ground and then another leg is reaching and they're sliding constantly all over the floor, I would encourage them to use their torso. This part of their body is not always engaged or activated so if the arm is reaching for in fact should the torso also be lifting and reaching while one leg is sliding? So is it always lifting in the direction that the arm, the top arm is up high reaching and then the foot is down low? Like is it sliding, is the torso sliding away from the body or is it towards that lifted arm or is it while one arm is reaching up high is the torso actually pulling in the opposite direction towards that foot that is sliding? This activating this torso would communicate a different message in the dance but it also would show the whole body being engaged so I ask those questions to help improve the overall look, lines, and dimension of the dance. The dancer does a great job of doing this scoop motion through space and kind of emerging through. To improve this, I would encourage the dancer to have more force or power in the arms to bring it down, right, like a bird. So they force those, they emerge and press through and then force those arms down, right, creating this circular shape. And having more precision in their movement. or excuse me, not effortlessly, that it looks effortless, which is, dance is really hard and dancers are always aiming to look effortless. So, just like a ballerina, it takes hours of practice and years of training to just do a couple steps of movement. So the fact that they were able to make this little step scuff look effortless is great. The dancer does an awesome job of keeping musicality here and showing the different rhythms in their feet and showing the different qualities of music. So this is a great demonstration of how the dancer can become the rhythm or become an instrument within the music. The dancer overall does a really nice job traveling. They have some pretty intricate travels where their foot is an anchor and then they're sliding, sometimes they're gliding, sometimes they're pressing their foot into the ground. So they do a really nice job of covering all of this space. Here I would repeat some previous notes about shoulders, over exaggerating those shoulders, and then again sending those hips back, bending those knees, and to have greater range of motion to be able to twist in and out. The dancer does a really good job of performing these step out and then bringing it in, step out and bringing it in. To improve this movement, I would question where is the body movement in the arms initiating from? Is it the palm of hands making the shoulders react to it or is it the shoulders moving that causes the arm to react? So being very clear on what the arms are or is it all together that the arms are kind of free flowing to whatever the feet are doing. Right now it's not clear because it seems as if the dancer is alternating where the emphasis of the movement is. So creating some clarity in this would be very helpful. To improve this section of the dance, I would question if the dance is supposed to be more melodic, which the music sounds currently at this moment, or is it supposed to be while the music is melodic, the dancer kind of has creates like these striking rhythms in it, right? So if it's supposed to be more melodic, I would encourage the dancer to have more flow and be a little bit more graceful as they move. And they can do this by swinging their arms and being more gentle in their body. Or if it's supposed to be striking, as opposed to the music being more melodic, to have more power and precision in this whole phrase work here. So it's choreographic choice. This is another note that I would give just generally about arms overall, is being intentional about where you place your arms and using the arms as an anchor. And where is the initiation of the arms? Is it supposed to be from the shoulders? Is it from the elbows? Or is it from the hands? That is what I'm wondering. So that is a slight thing that I would do to improve the overall look and lines of the dance. The dancer performs the step twists, and to improve these step twists and really to emphasize that it is the knees that are twisting, I would encourage them to send their hips back more and plie or bend their legs even more. This is their hips. This is my little diagram of their hips going back and their bum being back, and then they're bending their knees so they have greater range of motion to be able to twist those knees. We see here in and out. And then the other thing that I would do to improve is also working on the balls of the foot to be able to help with that range of motion to twist in and out. This would improve the dance not only because of that greater range of motion, but because it would create more accuracy and articulation in the knees. These step scuffs are really done really well. The way the dancer has one foot on the floor and then they scuff the floor, bringing their knee to their chest and then bring it back down, creating a step scuff, step scuff. These are performed really well where the whole foot is on the ground and then they scuff their heel as if they have a piece of gum on their foot and then bring it bring it down really well. Bring it down really back close to the body. So I really just wanted to highlight that moment because it was done so effortlessly.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He has trouble switching from this kind of upbeat into this slower beat here. More rehearsal of the choreography as well as a deeper embodiment of the rhythm would be beneficial. As a dancer performs these series of triple or shuffle steps in between his movements, he demonstrates that he's able to deeply embody the rhythm and stay on rhythm as well as stay on tempo as he's transitioning in and out of steps. He has a clear understanding of how to transition from one step to another. However, he would benefit from some clarity in his arm choreography as well as in his upper body in general. As the dancer gets further in this performance, he starts to lose his stamina here a little bit. His small steps, which before were able to really closely maintain the rhythm, start to fall off rhythm slightly, and he disengages his arms and doesn't do much with them choreographically. He also falls behind the rhythm quite significantly as he's performing this step, and not performing the triple step fully. As the dancer starts with a series of small kicks and some quick footwork, he shows that he has an understanding of the movement vocabulary here, however he could use a little bit of refining, particularly in the working leg here. He would benefit from engaging his upper leg muscles in his pelvis more to stabilize his kick so it doesn't come out in this flicking motion and has more control. He would also benefit from stabilizing his pelvis here as well as engaging his spine and his arms. As the dancer switches back to the same kicks that he was performing in the beginning of this performance, he again could benefit from some clarity throughout his body, particularly in the leg that's kicking, as well as some stability in his pelvis and down through his spine. More stability here, particularly in his pelvis, would help him to control his movement quality and control his movement dynamics, as well as stay more connected to the rhythm. As the dancer continues through this performance, it becomes clear that he's demonstrating the step as if he were partnering with someone else. You can see this here in his left arm outreached where there would be a partner over here on the other side. So he's primarily performing one step of the partner movement sequence, or one side of it, which shows he has a strong understanding of the movement technique and the movement vocabulary itself. As a dancer performs a series of turns around himself, he has a lot of stability in his turn and he's able to move quickly and efficiently. Primarily because of this bend in his knees and this dropping back of his pelvis, he's got a low center of gravity which helps him to turn quickly and efficiently. Here he would benefit from some added choreography of the arms as well as a straightening up of the posture through the top of the head, through particularly the upper spine. Perhaps spotting his head might be helpful here, though not super necessary for this movement vocabulary.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

As the dancer performs his basic salsa cross step, he's able to effectively engage with the rhythm or continue to engage with the rhythm through his shoulders, his arms, and his upper body in general. However, he starts to fall off tempo and off rhythm just a bit in his lower body, particularly because as he moves this crossing leg, which in this case is his left leg, he's picking this leg up far too high off the ground for the tempo demanded by the music. If you were to keep this movement a little bit smaller, perhaps bending through this supporting knee a bit more, he would be able to move more quickly and efficiently through this step and maintain a more consistent embodied rhythm. As the dancer begins with his basic salsa step, moving his feet directly underneath him, not locomoting too much through the space, he is effectively engaging his arms choreographically and demonstrates that he has a basic understanding of the movement vocabulary. He might benefit from dropping his pelvis back a bit more, grounding through his movement more deeply, and more effectively engaging the pelvis. As a dancer who performs this alternating step-touch step, he continues to effectively engage his arms choreographically in a way that's helping him maintain embodied rhythm as well as some more heightened movement dynamics. He again is moving his legs quite big in quite a big movement. So if you were to minimize this movement, perhaps not extending this leg that's doing the touch quite so far in front of him and keeping it closer to that supporting leg, he would be able to move more quickly and efficiently through the step.

They're a bit too straight to perform this movement and drop their pelvis back and down which would help to ground them in their movement and help them to find this clarity in the footwork quickly and efficiently.

They're also maintaining this nice soft bend in their knees, which is really helping them to move and transition through these movements effectively and efficiently. As the dancer begins with a basic salsa step that moves her forward and backwards in the space, she demonstrates that she has an understanding of the movement vocabulary and is at least familiar with the vocabulary. She is able to incorporate her arms in a way that is choreographically appropriate, and incorporate a small but fair range of motion in her pelvis while keeping her knees softly bent and her footwork fairly precise. However, the dancer is really struggling to connect to the rhythm here, especially as the music builds in tempo and percussiveness and intensity here. The dancer's movements are not matching that intensity and that tempo, which appears as though they're lagging behind the music. Some additional rehearsal and some refinement in the footwork and the rhythmic embodiment would benefit this dancer. As the dancer performs this ball change movement that locomotes them from side to side, they really need to find some clarity in their footwork here. It appears as though they're almost jumping their feet up and bringing them back down together rather than performing a ball change movement or landing one foot after the other. They've got a nice bend in their knees though they would benefit from dropping their pelvis down to be more grounded in their movement and clarifying their motion in their pelvis and up through their spine into their shoulders. Their arms are incorporated at a fairly well level though they could also use some clarity as well. As the dancer performs this body roll, they have a nice deep bend in their knees, which is helping them to stay grounded, though they would benefit from separating the feet just a tiny bit more so that they could drop their pelvis down a bit further. However, they have a nice articulation of the spine and into the pelvis, though they would benefit from incorporating the head a bit more into this body roll.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

That one, two step, stepping on the right foot, lifting the left knee and the hip, squaring the body to the backboard. Love how he uses the dribble to set up the footwork in this shot. You'll see two hands on the ball off the dribble. That guide hand is used to bring the ball up so that he can get his left-hand shooting hand behind the ball. So I love how he had two hands on the ball as he prepares to square and lift the ball into the shot. Would probably rather see him dribble with his left hand, but maybe not. Just so it's like a nice hard control dribble. But I love how his eyes and head are up. He's not looking at the ball as he dribbles. Again, great footwork, stepping on the right foot, raising that left knee, squaring the body and the hips to the backboard, eyes and head are up, shooting hand behind the ball.

Beautiful view here of a left-hand reverse layup. Great spacing in relation to the backboard and the rim. Great footwork, stepping off that right foot, elevating, raising the right or the left knee. So we're going off the right foot, raising the left knee and foot. Beautiful extension of the shooting arm and hand, shooting hands behind the ball. Great armbar bent 90 degrees to protect the ball from the defense. Again, love how he sets up his shot by bringing that guide hand to the ball as he lifts it from the dribble, up for the shot, great ball control, great support.

Same thing here, textbook footwork, lifting of that left knee, eyes and head are up, arm bar, high extension of that shooting arm, the left arm, shooting hand behind the ball, nice soft touch. Beautiful look here, beautiful footwork, stepping on that right foot and toe, lifting that left knee, beautiful extension, eyes and head are up, shooting hand behind the ball, guide hand at a 90 degree angle, offering support and ball control but also protecting the ball from the defense. Again, great extension of the elbow, shooting hand, left hand. I'd love to see him come down here a little bit more balanced, that kind of left knee is turned in, but love the chances of this ball going in. Beautiful rotation extension up on the top of the square. Beautiful footwork off the right foot, lifting of the left knee, squaring his shoulders. Love the elevation and lift, high extension of the shooting arm and elbow, beautiful flexion of the wrist and the follow through. You can see the ball leaving the fingertips.

Those are two of the natural tendencies of the high strings on a guitar. He's controlling it very well by using a very sensitive and lighter touch with his finger A up on that high string. So that's well done. It was a really nice crescendo to get to this more dramatic part of the piece. So it's a great musical decision. Lutars is doing a very nice job of bringing out the moving bass notes with finger P in the right hand. On the highest note of the scale, the top note, we heard a little bit of a twang to that sound. That just is because the string has become so shortened at that point, and we're so high up on the neck that it's a lot more sensitive, and so the guitarist just has to make sure that it isn't too aggressive of a movement up there, that it's a nice, firm but gentle pluck, because every movement that high in the string is going to be exaggerated in terms of what we hear. We just had one little moment there of left hand and right hand out of sync. We just need to make sure the left hand is a hair faster than the right hand so that left hand finger is already there by the time we pluck the string. We like to hear a little bit more of the middle voices here. We're losing a little bit of this chord's harmonic identity. And this is ascending scale, and each of the three note figures that are descending, we hear a bit of an accent. Ideally we would want all of these notes to sound the same. It's kind of a mental thing that he is doing here, to just place where he is in the scale, but we need to make sure that none of these notes are popping out, that it's just very even. We heard a little bit of a slide between the penultimate note of the scale and the ultimate note of the scale. And this is because the guitarist did not plan out a fingering where he would be able to use adjacent fingers. Instead, he had to use a fingering of 4, 4, 4 for three notes in a row. And that just makes it really difficult to both sustain the sound while also playing clean between the notes. So because he had to slide 4 to 4, we heard that slide. Whereas if he used a fingering that was perhaps maybe in this scenario 1, 2, 1, we wouldn't have had that slide and we could have better sustain in the notes. So it's just a matter of planning out the fingering better. It's a really great left hand shape. We can see a nice curve to all the fingers. The string is being played with the fingertip on all four stringers and we see that the thumb is in the middle of the back of the hand. So it's exactly what we want to see. We're hearing a little bit of distortion of pitch, a little bit of these middle voices being out of tune. That's because the guitarist is allowing the pressure of pushing down the strings to slide the strings up toward the low E string. So we want to make sure that even in a difficult hand frame like this, we're still making sure that our fingers are coming directly down on top of the string and not letting the string bend side to side. The guitarist is doing a great job of stretching his fingers, which is necessary here, without distorting the hand shape. So we now see that there's a two fret distance between fingers one and two, but that hasn't changed anything else about his hand. He made the necessary adjustment of bringing his wrist out further so that he could reach this better, and he's kept his fingers perpendicular to the strings in a relaxed hand, so that's excellent. That was an excellent shift. It was very smooth. We noticed the shape of the hand did not distort at all on the shift. Because the thumb is nice and loose and not clamping on the neck, he was able to just gently move his hand to the new location without any kind of a jerking movement. So excellent shift. That's a 10 out of 10 scale. Every note was clear, every note was consistent in terms of note envelope, in terms of dynamics. That was exactly how you should play a scale. There's a slight crescendo to the top of the scale and a slight decrescendo to the bottom. That's well done.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This is important because the climber eventually will have to transfer over the load when making the flag and to sustain that foot placement, it's important that the climber has control in continuing to apply pressure on that move. As the climber had pushed with the left toe, it had actually come out of contact. So she sends the left leg to be extended and is folding behind the right foot placement. This is called back flagging and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place as well as keeping balance and stability when performing the move. As she is trying to adjust the right hand grip to send over the load, also keeping the left leg extended helps the climber to keep her left side of the body towards the wall. The climber is starting at a one-hold start where she places both of the hands on the same hold. This is called matching and she's sustaining right now to the lip of the hold by placing the fingers inside of the hold and curling them and to add extra pressure onto the grip the climber sends the thumbs onto a pinch at the hold where she creates a squiz to secure the grip. Once the climber has done this we can see how she has extended the arms and leaned back to transfer the weight to the grips and before her feet were on the mat and the climber starts until her feet are no longer in the mat are placed onto the wall. Now her left foot is placed much lower on the foot chip than the right foot where it's now placed out on distance. This the climber will push down onto the foot chips to raise the hips. The climber performing the flag, her right foot has popped off from the foot chip and now both of the feet are on the mat ending the climb. The climber has pushed on the left toe this so the climber had direction on sending the right hand up for the reach and in doing so we can see how the climber has thrown her shoulder up in order to have more distance when making the right hand placement. Now the climber is placing the fingers above the flat surface of the hold which is above and wraps the thumb around the edge of the hold. This helps the climber to close the grip and apply pressure when sustaining it.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So the climber is doing a good job here because as he's keeping his arms in a straight position, he's also doing a good thing of making sure that he's able to adjust his body weight from left and to the right. So then that way he can kind of get a better understanding of the movement that's required of him, which is going to be ultimately pushing off of the right leg to kind of guide him in the correct direction to the screen hold that he's aiming for. What I'm noticing is that as the climber is shifting from left to right, he kind of limits himself on how far to the right he does go. I think this is a little bit more important to focus on just because as he's pushing himself up and to the right, the climber definitely wants to be able to get a good understanding of how that tension and how that coordination feels. So because the climber is limiting himself in how far right he's going, he's making it so that he's unable to really get a full understanding of the coordination that's required of him. So that's just one thing I would kind of encourage in the starting position for the climber. And so here we can see that this is the point when the climber is kind of closest to grabbing onto the green hold with his right hand. And then as he's releasing all the points of contact from the wall, we can see that with his legs, that with his left leg it's kind of going upwards while his right leg is kind of going downwards. So this is kind of showing where the focus is on the climber and which foot he's pushing off. So it kind of shows that he's pushing a lot on the left foot to kind of push him up in the direction that he needs to go to. However, the climber should focus a little bit more on the right foot being the main foot to pushing him upwards. So because the right foot is going backwards, it's kind of showing to me that the climber isn't entirely pushing off of it. And it's kind of just there hanging onto the wall. And so I would definitely focus on the climber being able to produce more power on that right foot. And this could help him get him closer into the green hold because he was unable to grab it in the way that he did it for this move here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And the moment the climber brings the hips against the wall, he will press the right toe harder so that he can gain height. And that way the climber is able to place the four fingers inside of the edge. As we can see the climber has made the move out of the hold with the left hand. This one because it was a type of grip that was more difficult to sustain and also is making the release of the left hand because it's on the direction that the climber needs to go for the next hold. As we can see the climber has brought himself to pull his center of gravity towards the wall. This is by raising the hips and the climber is stepping over on the highest foot. As we can see, the climber is performing some hand gestures. This is so the climber is able to visualize what to expect on the climb, as well as figuring out the sequence on when to make the next hand placement and how to hold on to it. As we can see the climber has sent the hand up for the sharp lip of the hueco hold. It's a hueco hold because the climber has a lot of space behind the sharp edge and he's only able to place two fingers on the hold. As we can see, two fingers would be difficult for him to sustain the hold. In this case he places the middle finger and the index finger. As we can see as well, he is pulling on it. So unless the climber has a lot of gripping strength on the fingers, he might be able to sustain the move. But also we can see how his center of gravity is really low and before he had swung out to the left to make the move, but now he's swinging over to the other side, meaning that he is overcompensating that grip, resulting to a potential fall. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start. The right hand being a pinch, the left hand being a small shallow hold. For the climber in order to apply pressure onto this ones he will have to apply pressure on the pinch by placing the thumb on the other side of the edge and the fingers on the other edge. This creating a clamping position the climber must pull away from the hold in order to sustain this press. And for the left hand the climber must keep the elbow close to the wall in order to generate pressure at the fingertips as the climber is keeping a closed grip with the fingertips pressing against the hold thinking of a knob. Now the climber will be able to start to climb until he places the feet on the wall which he is already ready on the first move.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She's got a lot of nice clarity in the positioning of her arms as well as her legs. She's performing the movement with the appropriate amount of energy and appears to be clear and precise in her movement here. As the dancer connects physically with her partner by connecting their her right hand with her partner She finds a bit more clarity in her movement. She's not performing things as Exaggerated as she was prior which is helping her to find some clarity in the choreography of her lower body as well as her arms However, she would still benefit from finding some clarity in her movement on more Particularly some precision in the use of her legs in the use of her pelvis as well as her free hand As the dancer begins with some basic kind of walking pattern social dance steps as she's facing her partner though not physically connected she's got a lot of nice clarity in her footwork however her movements are very exaggerated and appear quite big which is keeping her from being as connected to the rhythm as she would need to be. If she were to make her movements a bit smaller a bit more precise and find some refinement in her energy overall she would be able to connect more deeply with the music. As the dancer continues to find moments to connect with her partner physically, as well as find some separation between the two, she goes in and out of consistency with both her rhythmic embodiment as well as her choreographic precision. She appears to be aware of the movement vocabulary, though is probably at a very beginner level, as most of her improvisational movements, including the choreography of her arm, as well as use of her pelvis, appear to be quite disconnected from the conventions of the form. As the dancer performs a stationary sway side to side where she's swaying her pelvis as well as her upper body side to side in alignment with the music, she struggles to stay consistently connected to the rhythm here.

That was well done. We notice on this descending arpeggio that the notes being played with the first finger on the right hand are Popping out of the texture as much louder than the other notes. This is because it's a very strong Finger so the pianist just needs to make sure that they're using the weight of their hand equally From finger one all the way to finger five so that each note of this arpeggio Has the same Dynamic so you have to overcompensate a little bit to get especially finger four and five sound the same as thumb finger one Left hand and right hand a little bit out of sync at the top of that arpeggio. Just need to play this a tad bit slower for practice. The pianist is doing a great job of whenever they are crossing their fingers over the thumb, like they are here, especially in the right hand, of keeping the top of the hand flat and not tilting and rotating the arm. This allows them to play really smoothly and maintain great control of their fingers throughout arpeggios. We can do it with a little bit shorter of an articulation and of a note length in this lowest quarter of the piano here, just so that we get a better note clarity. Left hand and right hand are just a little bit out of sync. We see that the left hand and the left arm starting to rotate inwards as it's lifting the side of the left hand up here. This is just going to make it a little less accurate and a little inefficient, especially when playing quickly as she is here. Bringing the body a little bit over to the right as she goes up, a little bit more than she is, is going to help her to keep a more stable hand position throughout these arpeggios. Left hand and right hand are not in sync. Playing this a little bit slower would help with that. Pantos is doing a really great job of keeping the articulation, the note length consistent from top to bottom. They're elongating the notes slightly at the top of the scale, which makes them match the resonance of the lower notes at the bottom of the scale. So really well done. We notice a slight dropping of the wrist in the right hand, which means the fingers have to raise up a little bit higher to get just the finger action of pressing down the key. It's just not the most efficient way to play piano. It makes the fingers work harder. So raising up that wrist just a little bit and possibly sitting just a hair higher would allow them to get the most efficient use of their fingers, which then allows for greater sensitivity and greater control. The left hand is slower than the right hand. This is likely because the lower keys on the piano have a bit more resistance to them, making them naturally more slower responding. So you have to counteract that by playing just slightly more articulately in the left hand to make it sound the same as the right hand.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And then you want to keep the neck intact with the body so when the dancer is here, the dancer that's being bent back, this is sort of their head and this is their back versus this is their back and then this is their head. You don't want to break that there, especially if you're moving fast, that might be something that's uncomfortable. Hard to tell whether this is being improvised or not.

You can't see it super well in this frame, but basically their digits, their four sort of top digits are facing in this direction towards the body and that loads the shoulder a little bit more than the bicep. The issue with this is there would probably need to be a higher foot somewhere and this foot being as low as it is and also this foot being on just doesn't give enough opposition to be able to come in and match this jug this way, but I do think that it is a valid approach. I just don't think that it's supported enough with the feet. Climber then opts for the power approach and you can see they're getting into the hold but they're losing the foot as they move over it. And yeah I think that this is just a nature of this box being a bit too big. And I've expressed this in other videos.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I would encourage them to even give me a little bit more energy in those hands and those arms as you flick out, out and up, up. Because we're doing all this great work, we don't want to throw it away by missing any details in this movement. Notice how the dancer is often dancing on straight legs. I would encourage them to send their weight down so they can create some hip articulation that is needed for the Salsa step. This is a moment where this entire section is a moment that really needs more grounding so we can see that vivid hip articulation. I would encourage the dancer to make sure they start off really grounded so they're prepared to go. There was like a half a second hesitation to this basic salsa step. So you want to really make sure that you're ready to locked and loaded and ready to move at any single moment. Overall, I think the dancer can be more precise throughout the entire dance, but specifically in this movement, especially when they do this jump crossover out in here, and they're going to do it twice. So making sure that wherever they place their hands and their foot, they're being very specific about body placement to create these really dramatic shapes that allow for dynamic quality, but also allow for that professional precision that we're looking for. The dancer does a really good job of flowing their arms up and down. I would encourage them to spot a little bit faster with their head so they can make sure to turn really quickly. The dancers are doing a really nice job of having a tack as they turn and pivot, so kudos to them for that. It's a small little detail. Sometimes when they reach their arm, they reach up as opposed to cutting across, so making sure that if they're going to reach up, they're really intentional about reaching up versus if they're going to reach across their plane, making sure it stays in the shoulder socket, cutting across the space.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So we are lifting the foot slightly off the ground, better contact point with the ball. But again, we can see the body position, feet not necessarily moving with the ball when we're reacting to the ball. The body is again, high hip placement, back is very upright and actually leaning backwards away from the direction that we're moving in. If we're moving effectively with the ball, for me, we would see this right knee over the ball, body starting to turn to the right. And then obviously the player is then able to get his chest and his head slightly further forward as we're moving in the next direction. Here's a player just finishing this sequence, you see the importance of the footwork. So the player shifts the ball from the left to the right. The left foot generally plants very quickly to the ground, very flat footed, not moving his feet with the ball. Takes a couple of slight little hop as he reaches for the ball. But generally as we move the ball, we wanna move our feet, move our body with the ball so we don't end up reaching there with this straight leg to try and regain control of the ball. We can see by not moving our feet together, that's gonna now affect our control, our balance. And now even if the player does stop the ball or regain control, it's now gonna take time for us to reset before we can push off and complete the next action. Players are always on the inside of the left foot. Again, very flat footed to the ground as we're moving, not very light on our feet. Contact with the ball, again, very low, keeping our feet low to the ground, very straight legs. So we're very rigid in our motion. We're keeping the ball close, but we're not effectively dribbling. We're kind of shuffling and walking with the ball. The feet aren't in a running pattern, so we're not really dribbling at any speed. As you can see now, the leg position leads to a very high hip placement, upright back, so the body is not really moving with the ball, which is controlled by a lot of the footwork and the surface of the foot that the player is utilising to dribble. Again, player with the left foot, so utilising the inside of the foot to change the direction of the ball. So heel down, toe up, again we can see the player's contact with the ball is really on the lower half of the ball, so we're kind of shuffling through the strike. We want to try and make contact with as close to the middle part of the ball with the inside of the curvature of the foot as possible so we can maximise the contact and the quality of the control. Again you can see the player's body position, very upright, very straight, high hip placement, back up straight, so although the body is leaning slightly forward you can see the head is well in front of the ball and with the legs straight and the body leaning forward that means that although our upper body momentum is moving forward, we're not in a fully controlled position and we want our knees to be bent, get our hips lower and get that ball out of our feet a little bit further so we're not leaning too far over the ball and losing our balance. Again, player dribbling with the inside of the left foot, contact very much closer to the toe area, which is a more rounded, harder surface, less contact between the ball and the foot, so we lose elements of control. We can also see the player, again, very upright position, straight leg to control the ball, feet are close together, so even with the slight bend in the right knee, hips in a very high position, back up straight, player is not effectively moving his body and his feet with the direction that the ball is traveling, so we're gonna lose elements of balance, control, and speed. Player here utilising the inside of the right foot. Again, you can see the contact with the ball now is closer to the big toe area. So we've lost a little element of control with our prior touch. And then as we take that heavier touch and move, we can see that the left leg, just based on the position of the right leg being nice and straight, and then the contact between the foot and the ball, that we haven't moved our body, moved our feet quickly enough behind the line of the ball to give ourselves the best possible chance to change direction at speed and under full control with good balance. So although this left knee is bending, you can still see the hips are very high because of the straight right leg. You can also see that the chest is facing one way, the hips are starting to turn the other. So the player is really fighting to just change direction and get the ball moving back between the cones. Once again, player dribbling, shifting the ball from right to left, looking to continue to move, see the footwork, again as he shifts it from the right to left, right foot becomes very planted to the ground, not moving his feet necessarily with the ball and behind the ball. The left foot making contact with the ball, you can see, very flat to the ground, so although he's presenting the inside surface of the foot, the ball is now going to be hitting the big toe area of the left foot, which is a harder surface and he's also making contact with the lower half of the ball, so the control element over the ball is limited. We want to maximise the surface area between the front of the ball, strike through the middle of the ball, inside curvature of the foot, get the left knee over the ball so we can start to bend our knees and get our body moving fluently with the direction of the ball. We're going to lose elements of control in these actions. As that right foot plants again, you can see again, straight left leg, high hip placement, back up straight, we want to make sure that we are bending our knees, getting our hips low to the ground, better centre of balance, provides improved agility, improved control, improved speed and can get our body moving with the ball. Player dribbling with the right foot. Again we can see although the body is starting to lean towards the left, see the body position is still relatively square. Some more from this angle here, you can see the body is still very square as he's turning his right toe in to make control with the side to the front of the ball. So as that ball is moving in a way, we want the player to be in a better balanced position with his knees bent, hips lower, body starting to turn in the direction he wants to go with his chest leaning slightly forward so we can generate the maximum amount of speed and control as we're dribbling through. Player dribbling here with the right foot. Again, we can see the contact with the ball is closer to the toe area of the foot, very flat-footed to the ground. So the player is obviously looking to move the ball across between the cones, but the body and the footwork is gonna make it difficult to maintain the control and the speed the player wants. We can see how close the feet are together on contact. So although this knee is slightly bent, we're not really gonna have a platform to be able to push off, change direction. Straight right leg, want that right knee for me to be bent and over the top of the ball. That's gonna help with our body position. Get this left foot slightly further back so we can push off that, maintain our balance. Low hip placement and starting to turn our body towards the direction we want the ball to go, just to help in terms of our changes, speed and direction. Player again using the inside of the right foot. So from the prior touch, see the player's not necessarily moving his feet. So he's not getting his body behind the ball, which leads to then this straight leg position with the right foot. So although the body is starting to turn and lean to the direction we wanna go, the body, it's not necessarily moving with the ball. So we're gonna be off balance as we make the touch this way. So the right foot is ultimately gonna have to land first before we can push off and move. And if the player is not in balance on making contact, that's gonna make it a little bit more difficult for the player to maintain control and generate any speed. You can also see again, there's no real bending the knee. So the body is very upright and straight. So we're kind of relying on our footwork to move the ball, not our body. Play utilising the inside of the left foot to maintain the dribbling sequence. You can see here inside of the foot, heel down, toes slightly up, still kind of hitting underneath of the ball. So when we kind of make contact with the ball, it's going to affect the quality and control. We want to try and strike through the middle of the ball so it's clean and concise and that maximises the surface area between the foot and the ball. You can see here with the straight left leg as he's making contact with the ball that we're not going to get our left knee over the ball and get our body moving effectively with it. That straight leg is going to mean we're going to make contact, potentially land on this left leg before we change direction. I like that the body is starting to lean and turn towards the direction that we want to go. So that's beneficial for the player. It's going to help the transition from moving to the left to the right. Play again, just looking to dribble with the left foot. More shuffling than dribbling. We can see the position of the foot. Very flat parallel to the ground. So when we're dribbling, ideally we want to be in a running motion. So as we're making contact with the ball, we're going to use the inside of the foot. It's to push through the middle of the ball with the inside of the foot, with the heel down, toe slightly up, and then moving in the same direction that the ball is traveling. Or dribbling with our laces, with our toe pointing down, so we're traveling with more speed. Here you can see the player is not in a running stance or stride. Very upright, legs straight, high hip placement. Body should be leaning towards the direction that we want to go, in terms of turning his hips, turning his chest, to improve the efficiency, the speed, the balance and the control that we have. and you can see from the prior touch, so although he utilized the inside of his right foot with the side of the ball, again, the body position and the contact with the ball meant the ball moved forward, so he wasn't necessarily moving his body with the ball and redirecting the ball with his technique. So we're now taking another touch with the inside of the right foot to try and move the ball through the cones. Once again, we can see as the player's moving forward, the body position is very much just straight forward here, hips forward, chest forward, legs not necessarily in a fluently running position, we're kind of shuffling with the ball, a little upright, high hip placement, so we want a lower center of gravity, better balance, better control, a better protection of the ball. Can also see as the body's up straight, the legs are up straight, so the body's slightly leaning forward with the head in front of the ball, so we're not gonna necessarily have full balance as we change direction. And we see the player dribbling now with his left foot. So once again, a key element for this player is as the player consistently moves the ball with the inside of his feet. On contact with the right foot, you see the right foot doesn't really move. It plants to the ground, stays in a very static position as the ball's traveling. And now the player's relying on now reaching out this left leg to make contact with the ball. So it's gonna have difficulty with two things in terms of the player's balance as the feet start to grow further apart and when they're reaching for the ball. Obviously the player, when he's not moving his feet with the ball, he's not gonna be in a good set position when he makes contact with the left foot to now move the ball and move his body effectively with the ball. So I wanna make sure as we shift the ball, we move our feet on contact with the inside of the left foot if that's the surface we're gonna use. We wanna make contact with the middle of the ball, get our left knee over the ball, bend our knees, get this right leg coming across, bend our knees so we get our hips lower, better balance, better control, better ability to push off that back leg. Get our body starting to turn as we get this left knee over the ball. So as we push the ball out into the space from left to right, our body is now moving in the same direction as the ball. We can generate better speed, better control. play a dribbling with the right foot so we can see again using the inside of the foot hard to see the exact part of the ball he's making contact with but from the position of the foot here you can see potentially the lower half of the ball which is going to affect the consistency and the quality of the touch run straight through the middle of the ball through the middle of the foot to change direction you can see again the body is very square to the direction we want to go on contact I'd like to see that body starting to turn towards the direction we want to go can we get our right knee over the ball when dribbling with our right foot to come that way the left knee sees bending which is which is good but you can see the straight leg we're reaching out leads to a higher hip placement so in terms of our ability to change direction protect the ball get better balance and control that's going to be affected by this body position here so it's important when the player is moving from side to side bending his knees getting low to the ground so we can change direction effectively and fluently player utilizing the inside of the right foot, using more of the big toe area, still kind of hitting with the lower half of the ball which is going to affect the speed and the efficiency that we can travel at as we're pushing the ball through this space. What I do like here is the body is starting to turn so you can see the body starting to turn to the left-hand side so as we push the ball through this gap if we can get our body moving with the ball that's going to improve our speed and balance and control. One thing I look for when we're using the inside of the foot is to really demonstrate that the body is moving with the ball, can we get the right knee over the ball that will bring the hips forward, the chest forward so we are moving in unison and with the direction of the ball improve our fluency, control and speed. And for me, dribbling is very much about the player's footwork. We can see as the player shifts the ball from left to right, from the, sorry, from right to left, the right foot stays very planted to the ground, very flat footed. So as the ball's traveling across, the body's not able to move across. So now we end up reaching with a straighter leg with the left leg, which is going to affect both our control, our speed and our balance. See the player again in a very upright position, hips nice and high, back up straight. So the player doesn't have full balance and control with the ability to now change direction at speed and effectively protect the ball. Again, once again, you can see as the player shifts the ball from left to right, I'm on contact with the left foot with the ball and the ball moves, the left foot stays pretty stuck in the mud, pretty flat. So as we're moving the ball to the left, we want to try and move our body with the ball, keep our feet agile and not just fully contacting to the ground. So as this left leg now plants, now we're reaching out with our right foot. So now we get this high hip placement and we're really just redirecting the ball, not dribbling with it. Back up straight. Again, we can see the position, the contact between the foot and the ball onto the big toe area, which is going to limit our control of the ball. Looks like we're hitting the lower half of the ball. We want to try and get as much contact through the ball as possible. If we're changing direction effectively, you'd like to see this right knee over the ball, which will bring the hips forward and get the body starting to turn in the direction that we want to go. Player again, he's keeping the ball really close to his feet, but he's not effectively dribbling with the ball. Again, we can see that just through the position with the contact with the ball and the cone, very close to the cone. So we're not in full control of this outcome based goal of dribbling through the cones. See the feet very flat to the ground. I want to see the player working more on the balls of the feet, moving his feet with the ball. So when he's making contact with the inside of the right foot, we're making contact with the middle of the ball, heel down, toe up. So we maximize the control and quality of the touch. We can once again see the body position of the player is very high. So we're not really bending our knees too great. High hips, high upright back position. So we're kind of allowing the ball to hit our feet as opposed to us moving our feet with the ball, making good quality contact with the ball and effectively dribbling in the same direction as the ball is going and having full control and speed. Again we look at the player dribbling from his right foot to his left as the player makes contact with his right foot across. His right foot plants to the ground and doesn't move with the ball. So we want to be on the balls of our feet, more light on our feet so now we don't end up in this position where our right foot's not moving, the ball's travelling from right to left and now we reach out with this straight leg to try and regain control. Because even if we make contact with the inside of the foot with the right part of the ball, as the ball's travelling this way, the feet are still going to have to readjust before we can move with the ball. So we want to make sure that we are moving our feet with the ball, getting our left knee in a position over the ball, but the only way we can do that is by moving that right foot first and then we can start to talk about getting our body in a position where we are now moving in the same direction the ball is going. Here you can see on contact we want the ball to go this way, but the hips and the body are all facing in a different direction so the speed at which we change direction is going to be impacted. As you can see here, the player is using the right foot to shift it across to the left. As soon as the right foot makes contact with the ground, it plants very firmly into the ground so he's very flat footed. This has been a constant with the player, not necessarily moving his feet with the ball, shifting the ball with one touch to the other and then he ends up with this straight leg with the left foot making contact with the ball and just redirecting the ball rather than dribbling with it. Once again, you can see from the distance that the feet are apart, he's not moving with the ball, leads to these straight legs, high hips. The ball is moving but the body is not moving in line with the ball. Again, we can see as he's making contact with the left foot with the ball to turn it to the right, the hips and the chest are still facing directly forward towards the left. On contact, we want that body to start to turn this way and to do that, we've got to move our feet first to get our body in a better set position to be able to do so. The player here dribbling the ball from left to right, almost shuffling the ball. You can see again the player takes a little two-step to get his body behind the ball, but on making contact with the ball we can see the position of the feet very close together, very upright in his stance, high hips, back up straight. Again, we're not really putting ourselves in a position where we can dribble with any element of speed, both with our footwork and our body position. The player is keeping the ball close, but very underneath his body and his feet. So we can see the feet very flat-footed, hitting again the very bottom part of the side of the ball, so we're not going to really maximise the control and accuracy as we're dribbling. So we want to try and strike through the middle of the ball, get our feet slightly further apart, bend our knees, low hip placement. As we're making contact with the ball, we want more of a knee over the top of the ball, left foot moving back, body in a more effective position to move with the dribbling action. Once again, players are on the inside of the right foot, we see how flat their feet are to the ground, so although we're utilising the inside of the foot, we're hitting, kind of just letting the ball hit our feet, hitting the lower half of the ball, so we're not really fully controlling the ball or mastering the technique of the ball. We see from the ball position to the cone where the player wants to go, we're not necessarily getting the outcome goals that we ideally want. Feet, legs, again, feet not really moving behind the line of the ball to help the player change direction and travel at speed efficiently. High hip placement, which means we're going to have less balance as we change direction, less ball protection, less ability to push off at speed. Upright back, so we want to try and bend these knees, get the hips lower so we can get our chest leaning slightly forward, getting our hips and our chest turning towards the direction we want the ball to go, and making sure that the player is not just solely focused on the ball throughout the action, but keeping glancing up and around to check his surroundings and build better awareness of the situation around him. Once again, player dribbling with the right foot. So although when we talk about dribbling, we wanna keep the ball close, we wanna make sure that we are in a good, solid foundation position for my body. So when we change direction, we're not fully over the top of the ball or the ball stuck under our feet. So again, you can see the elements of control just through the activity. When the player's changing direction, we can see how close the ball is to the cone. So we can see that the player doesn't have full control over the ball throughout the dribbling sequence. We can see the feet very flat, very planted to the ground. So he's losing elements of mobility. The contact point with the ball again is with the inside of the foot, but with the lower half of the ball, because of how close his feet are to the ground, we want that foot to be higher, making contact through the middle of the ball for the maximum contact and control. We wanna make sure that we're moving our feet in a way that allows us now to change direction, get our left knee over the ball, bend our right knee, which would be the foot that we can push off as we move with the ball, get our hips low, start to get our hips turning as we make contact with the ball. Here on contact with the right foot, you can see the body is still very square and facing forwards. On contact, we'd like to see the body starting to turn with the ball so we can effectively move at speed and when we've better balance and control. and player changing direction with the left foot. We can see from the body position, the footwork, player again, utilizing inside of the left foot. We are making contact with the lower half of the ball, which is not gonna maximize the contact, the accuracy, the weight that we're dribbling at. With the change of direction, we can see that the feet, again, the body is not necessarily moving with the ball. The feet are relatively at distance. We have moved that body. We can see a straight leg with the right leg. I'm making contact here. I'd like to see the right knee over the ball. That helps us turn our hips, turn our chest towards the direction that we wanna go and have control, speed, and balance. We can see the high hip placement. Again, the higher the hips, the more upright we are. We see from the back position. So we lose elements of balance, control, and the ability to change direction effectively at speed. Again, the player just losing elements of control as the ball comes from the right across to his left. So here the player does move his feet a little bit more, but still you can see from this really long straight leg, the position of the foot, toe pointing down and striking kind of the front side to lower off of the ball. Not in full control of our body as we're moving and dribbling with the ball. So although the knee is bending, the hips are facing and the chest is turning towards where we want to go, we want to see the knee slightly bent, hips in a low body position, low central gravity so we can now really make contact with this ball through the gap and then push off and you get our body moving in the same direction that we're moving the ball. Again, here the body very upright, head really behind the line of the ball so we want to be more fluent in our action. Player dribbling with the inside of the right foot. Again, we can see a little flat footed as the player is shuffling. Feet low to the ground. Looks again like we're making contact with the lower half of the ball. I'd like to see the foot slightly higher through the middle of the ball. Again, we're very upright in our position, so I want to bend these knees. Lower our hips as we make contact with the ball with the right foot. For me, I'd like to see the body beginning to turn a little bit more in the direction we want to go. We can see the chest and the hips are still facing forward, very square. When we're making contact to come to the right, I'd like to see that body start to turn. And also get obviously lower to the ground so we can get our body moving more effectively with the ball at speed and with greater balance. Once again, player loses elements of control so as the ball travels across his body, we can see the player again reaching out with this straight left leg and the distance between the right foot and the left foot are growing further apart so as the player makes contact with the ball the balance is going to be off. You can also see the player off balance because of the position of his left foot as he's trying to control. If we're changing direction with the inside of the left foot, I'd like to see the heel down, toe slightly up, striking through the middle of the ball in the direction he wants to go with his left knee closer to being vertically on top of the ball which would then bring the body forward and in a better position to move in unison with the ball. We can see the player is really reaching out for the ball and he's still in a very upright position, high hip placement so we're not getting good balance, good control, ability to change direction with speed. Player dribbling with the left foot, so although we can see the toe pointing slightly up, it's very low to the ground, very flat footed in the player's motion, hitting the underside part of the ball, so we're not really maximising our control and accuracy, we're going to end up scooping the ball, we want to strike through the middle of the ball, so we want this left foot to be higher, lock his ankle, get his knees bent over the ball, again the right foot not really moving in a position where now the player can change direction and push off, so we have this straight leg, we have this high hip placement, back up straight, so the body is not really moving fluently with the ball. You can see again the contact point with the ball, big toe area, bottom of the ball, we're not going to have maximum control to move the ball through this gap, and you can also see from the distance between the ball and the body, and the body position, the player is not effectively moving his body with the ball. If he is doing that, we'd see this left knee closer to on top of the ball, and the chest moving in the same direction the ball is travelling. The player utilising the inside of his feet to change direction and dribble through the cones left to right. So just starting with the footwork we can see the players foot is in a decent position, heel down, toe up through the middle of the ball. That's going to maximise the control. We can see the player is making contact with a very straight leg. You can see from his left leg bending here, the distance between the two feet are a little far apart so we don't have the balance and the fluidity to change direction effectively. We can also see the hip placement is high. We want a lower hip placement, better balance, lower centre of gravity. As we're making contact with the ball, here with the left side of the ball, we want to try and make sure that we're getting our knee over the ball which brings our hips and our body closer to the ball, turning towards the direction we want to go. Player again using the inside of the left foot, we can see here the toe is pointing slightly up but the heel is really close to the ground, still hitting the lower half of the ball, it's going to affect elements of our control and speed. We can see the body position through the position of the legs and the distance the feet are apart, the player is not necessarily moving his body in line with the ball or with the ball. We can see the lower hip placement, upright back, so we want to see the knees bent, hips lower, chest leaning slightly forward, hips and chest then turning towards the direction we want to go to maximise the efficiency and speed at which we are dribbling. Player utilising the inside of the left foot. So again, toe pointing straight out through the ball. We can see the player again, straight leg position, not really moving the right foot with the ball. So we're kind of really relying on just the contact with the right foot to the left and the left to the right to move the ball, not really utilising our body. And we can see that through the high hips, the back up straight. Here you can see the head and the chest are leaning slightly back from the direction of the ball. So just lose elements of that control, balance and speed. player dribbling with the left foot again we can see contact with the ball although we are making contact here with the inside of the left foot meaning contact with the lower half of the ball we can see how flat the feet are to the ground we see the straight legs that's going to impact the players balance control and speed and we'd want to make sure making contact again it looks like we're hitting through the bottom of the ball foot needs to raise up get his knee slightly higher so we have better control and cushion as we're dribbling and changing direction with the inside of the foot get this right knee bent hips nice and low so we can increase or improve our low central gravity helps with our balance control and speed over the ball and get our chest slightly leaning forward in the direction we want the ball to go again we can see on impact the ball is going to be traveling this way but the body is still very square and pointing in a very straight direction so we're going to really impact our ability to effectively change direction and speed and under control As the player just finishes the action here, shifting the ball from his left to the right. Again you can see, although here the body is leaning forward slightly, you can see that the legs are very upright, high hips, so regardless of the body moving with the ball, if we don't have that, better balance in our lower body, bending our knees, getting our hips lower to the ground, we're just going to knock ourselves off balance and the ball obviously being very close to our feet is one thing, but being under our body in this position is going to make it very difficult for the player to push off with any kind of speed or be able to change direction quickly from this body position. So we want to get our knees bent, hips low, yes body leaning forward, ball close to our feet but still moving slightly out in front of us so we can maintain our balance and that allows us to have more success in different areas when related to dribbling. Player again dribbling through the cones left to right we can see with a position with the ball in relation to the cone the player doesn't necessarily have control of the direction or the weight of how he's dribbling with the ball. You can also see that he continues to dribble with his feet very flat to the ground, toes pointing forward so he's kind of shuffling through and not really running with speed. If we're running with elements of speed we'll see the toes pointing down slightly more as we're going through and then changing into this action where the heel is down, toe up, pushing through the middle of the ball to change direction and obviously we're trying to avoid the cone so our previous touch would be more into the space to create that space to move through. We can again see the fluency of the running action, player very upright although his left leg is bent and we can see the body in a very upright position high hips we want our hips to be lower as the player is starting to push the ball to the right, we want to see these hips starting to turn to the right, chest starting to turn to the right or sorry to the wards the left the direction the ball wants to go so we can make the action more fluent. Again, using the inside of the left foot, again not necessarily dribbling in a fluent running action. You see that from the feet position, where they are, the straight legs. So again, when the legs are straight, it's going to lead to a higher hip position. And the body now is upright, his head is over the ball, but obviously the body is not necessarily moving with the ball. So we want to make sure that we are bending our knees, getting our hips lower to the ground, increases the balance, the control, the ability to generate and change direction at speed, utilizing our arms for balance, making sure that the contact point with the ball is behind the line that we want the ball to go. Here you can see the toe pointing forward, making contact with the front to the left. So we're really relying just on, you know, just shuffling our feet, moving our feet with it rather than fully controlling the direction of the ball. Again, we're talking about dribbling, we want to keep the ball close, we want to be moving with the ball as much as we can. So a lot of that is the footwork of the player. And when we are dribbling with the inside of the foot, but both feet are staying relatively flat to the ground, not working on the balls of our feet, makes everything else in terms of the body position, the ball control, the speed at which we can dribble very difficult. So we can see again, as the player is moving the ball across not necessarily moving his feet. So we can see that again with the left leg position, although the right knee is bent, the hips are still very high, the back's upright and actually leaning back away from the direction we want to go, which is effectively forwards. We're changing direction obviously to the right, but we want to go forward. So as we're making contact with the left foot, we'd want to see left foot through the middle of the ball, left knee moving closer to on top of the ball, which is going to help our body start to turn towards the ball and get our chest leaning slightly further forward in a position over the ball so we can move effectively at speed. Again, prioritising the inside of the left foot to change direction. So here, foot's in a relatively decent position, but we can see that we're making contact more with the underside of the ball rather than really controlling and maximising the touch through the middle of the ball into the space. We can also see that the body is not moving in line with the ball, so we want the body to move across with the ball so we can continue to maintain our balance and change direction. You can see from the position of the right foot that that right foot is really planted to the ground and now we're reaching out a little bit with the left. So in terms of our balance and control, we lose elements of that. We can also see the hips very high, back up straight, so the player in terms of his effectiveness in changing direction from left to right is going to be limited throughout the action. Here again, player kind of just shifting the ball with the inside of his left foot to his right. We can see obviously the contact with the ball foot is relatively low to the ground. So we're making contact with this lower half of the ball. Again, we can see if the outcome of the exercise is to dribble through these spaces in the cone, we can see the position with the ball and the cone on contact with the ball with the right foot is very close. So we don't have full control in terms of the outcome from the player. And we can see the body is very, very, very straight, very square to the direction he wants to go. And so when we're making contact with the right foot with the inside of the ball to travel to the left, we wanna be in a better position where our knees are bent. So we get our hips lower to the ground, move our feet with the ball and on contact, get our body starting to turn towards the direction we want the ball to go. So we can be more fluent in our action, generate better control, better balance, better speed. player dribbling with the right foot. Again, we can see from this example here, it's more about the player shuffling with the ball and the contact with the ball, as opposed to the footwork and the balance of the player. So we can see here the left foot very close to the right and effectively in the direction that we wanna go. We can see the contact point between the ball again is with the inside of the foot, but the foot is very low to the ground, very flat footed, so we're striking the ball through the lower half of the ball, so we don't really have full control over where the ball is gonna be going. We also see again, the ball very close to him, but very much under his body and his feet, making it very difficult to travel at speed and with control. Upright body position with the legs straight, high hip placement, back up straight, the ball is actually gonna be moving left and the body is leaning back. So the player's footwork, his control of the ball and his body movements to move with the ball is gonna slow him down and affect his control and ability to move freely. Play again utilising the inside of his right foot to change direction. We can see everything aligned with the player is basically pointing forwards and in the direction towards the right side of the cone. So in contact with the right foot, inside of the right foot with the left of the ball, we're ultimately looking to change direction. So on contact, I'd be looking for the player to start to adjust his body position to move towards the left. We can see the player's feet relatively close together, which is going to lead to a more upright position, high hip placement, back up straight so the player doesn't have maximum amount of balance, agility, fluency in terms of his change of direction and moving the ball from right to left. Again, player dribbling with the inside of the right foot. So although the toe is pointing slightly up, you can see the contact with the ball on the lower part of the ball. So we're not really maximizing our contact and control. Legs, again, very straight, not really moving with the ball. So we wanna bend our knees so we can get our hips lower to the ground, which is gonna allow us better balance, better control, better change of speed. Very upright back position. And again, the body not really turning with the ball. So the player is kind of moving the ball left to right with the inside of his feet, but his body is not necessarily moving the ball, which is gonna impact our ability to protect the ball and our ability to change speed.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Her arms are flying up as she's moving horizontally, but they really should be placed in a position she needs to have further control of her arms. It's okay if they are moving naturally, but she doesn't really seem to be putting any thought into them. The dancer is not articulating her footwork enough right now. Her foot is supposed to be crossing behind her, her left foot, but instead her left foot is not behind her right foot, it's actually aside her right foot. So she needs to really articulate her footwork and designate the positions in which they're supposed to be in. In these crossover steps, the dancer needs more refinement. It looks as if she is running instead of purposefully stepping. So each step that she does, each time her foot reaches or touches the ground, she needs to have a very designated area that she's going to instead of just running horizontally. The dancer is not moving with the music. She's dancing simultaneously as the music is playing, but it doesn't seem like she's connecting with the music. For instance, when she's kicking forward and then jumping backwards, it's not in timing or in rhythm that the music is playing in. So it just seems that whatever her choreography or if this is improvisation, regardless, the timing is not set to this music. Also, the dancer should be pointing her foot at her ankle joint right now. The leg line is disrupted by how her foot is flopped. It's not fully flexed, which would be creating a perpendicular right angle with her leg, but it's somewhere in between pointed and flexed right here, so she needs to further articulate her feet. When the dancer kicks her leg forward, she does not strain her leg. Her leg should be in a straight line here, not bent as it is. The dancers focus is too downward. She should be looking straight outward and ahead and not having so much of the floor in her Immediate view in order to do this. She should lift her chin higher The dancer is not traveling enough. Every time she's moving horizontally, she's only using a small portion of the floor. She needs to take larger steps, so she uses a larger portion of the floor. The dancers arms are a bit awkward here. They're floating out. They're not placed in a position. The dancers arms also just need to be more natural. She's holding them stiffly while they're floating here. When the dancer is running here to her left side, she's doing so on flat feet. Her feet are completely on the ground. She should be stepping on her toes first, not on her full foot. It's just too heavy.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You can't even see his, you know, his hands or body in this picture. I'd love to see him more square here with his body in the picture. He's kind of tossing. He's got a long ways to go when you kind of hook it up there. Again, you know, just kind of real soft, non-aggressive dribble right here. It doesn't really take him anywhere. He's just kind of, what I say, considered like going through the motions here. We just love to see him just lengthen his stride, really power that one dribble out in front of him. Let it take you somewhere. Let it drive your body and help lift your body up. A little better lift here. He's getting off the ground a little bit more, that push off of the left foot. I love that he's got his arm bar. Let's get that right elbow in. He's just kind of got, he's again, really winding it up here and shooting over that right shoulder. Let's square that right shoulder and shoot out in front of us. And even on his landing, you can see how he's still turned. His right shoulder is not square to the basket. His hips, his knees are all facing that side wall. And basically, you're just kind of flipping the ball up there. Again, steps on the left foot. Little, you know, better stride here in terms of getting his feet apart. But let's use this left foot to really plant, kind of turn our body inward and really follow the strong right lift of the hip. So he, his first dribble is just right next to him right here. Would love this dribble to be, you know, out in front of you. And usually I call this a power dribble. Like that one dribble is hard and it gives your body momentum and it helps it to lift off the body. So this, he takes a real passive soft dribble next to him and his feet are really close together. Would love for the dribble again to be more out in front of him and a lot harder and more aggressive. Again, just a real soft dribble, kind of lacks the intensity that you would like to see to be more effective in a game situation. You know, there's defense all around. You've got to go hard and be aggressive, and you like to practice that in this drill setting. But he's got the right idea. He's going off the correct foot. Would love to see more lift and elevation here on the shot. It just barely goes up off the ground. Let's really speed up the movement here. Again, the shot is kind of over his right shoulder. We'd love to see his body more square and shooting more straight on. You can see how his elbow goes way out here. Again, we'd love to see more lift and elevation and make it more game-like. You know, with the defense here, you've got to get up off the ground to finish around the basket. Again, better landing here, feet are apart, knees are bent, he's got his arm bar up still, let's hold this follow through until it goes through the basket. He definitely keeps his eyes up and on the target, which is really good. Again, love to see more lift and elevation. He's got a little bit here, but I think this guy's capable of really getting up off the ground here. Again, just kind of just real soft footwork here. We'd love to really see him push off hard and aggressive with that left foot and really causes that right leg and hip to expand and go up. He's lifting the ball with two hands, which is what you want to see. Here, just little steps, maybe even an extra step here. You know, you want to take as few steps as possible. You know, get to the basket and score as quickly as possible. Good job here with both hands on the ball to offer more support and control as you take the ball from the floor up to the release. Here the shooter uses one dribble to get to the right side for the reverse layup. Correct footwork. He's going off the left foot on the right side. That right knee is following behind. Two hands on the ball. Eyes and head are up. It looks good. Again, just kind of going 50% speed. Would love to see him pick it up a notch here. Again, you know, take off the left foot, which is always, he always does a great job with that, but really use it to push up that right knee. I love that he's got his arm bar here. That's good. Good extension here of the right elbow. But again, he's kind of shooting over his right shoulder. To see the distance that ball has to travel versus if he came right here with this shot. Again, you can see him, you know, when you land on this left foot, you also want to use that left foot to be a pivot foot. A pivot foot to help square and get your body in this particular movement facing the basket. Here, see how his shoulders, his body's turned to this side wall. You want him to, you want to square your shoulders up to this basket that you're shooting at. I mean, he's not even in the picture here. Let's use that left foot push off pivot to face our body, our hips, our shoulders to the basket. And then, you know, he takes these little teeny steps. This drill, the layup drill is just if you can cover distance here and have your stride be a lot more lengthened and more aggressive. I do love that he does get the ball in two hands to give more ball control here. He's not getting sloppy, you know, and sticking the ball out here with one hand. And I love that he's not looking at the ball when he dribbles. His eyes and head are up. So nice job there. Again, shoots over that right shoulder. Let's square that right shoulder up. Better job here of squaring the legs and hips. But you can see here, see the distance this ball has to cover? I mean this is his how much he gets off the floor. He doesn't really get off the floor very much. Again, will be easily guarded and defended. Good lift here. Would love to see this arm more extended than bent here because he has let the ball go. But you can see his push off is just not as aggressive as you would like it to be. I really feel like he could really push up off hard and really pull that right hip up more aggressively to get more lift and elevation and really make this more game-like. Just kind of pick up the speed and intensity here. Love his eyes are up. He's got good lift here with the right hand. Arm bar is where it needs to be. You can see, though, he's kind of really out of this picture here. So he's really having to take this ball a long ways to shoot it. He really needs to be right in here where he can square his shoulders up and shoot the ball right off the backboard.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And Sik just sets up to make the dead point to this move but he's going up with his right hand. And so he's currently left hand, left foot. So the moment he takes his right hand off the wall, his whole body just wants to barn door away from the wall. And he loses all tension and just isn't able to hit it. And for this move he kind of wants to move a little slower and control just because the hold he's going to is pretty bad. And he's coming off one of these pinches which is not the most positive. So some stuff he could have done is possibly match his feet here and kind of do a twist lock and get his torso into his chest, into his arm and bicep. And really twist in to be able to move slowly up to this hold and pinch it really nicely. Or to rework that heel hook sequence on this right hand and really sink that heel in or maybe toe in. Or maybe even bicycle. Since this left foot is on an undercling he might believe in bicycle to keep some tension. But yeah, here you can see, you know, right as he hits it, you know, his left hand and left foot are still on. He just loses all that tension on the right side. Another thing we can see too is this pinch, it's kind of angled here. So, you know, when he's on this side of the hold, very positive, but the more to the left he gets, it's going to be harder. He's going to have to pull more in with that pinch and kind of fight the position.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You can see it's outside of the square. He also has good height as it's reached the top portion of the square. But since it's outside of the square, we need to have side spin on the ball in order for it to spin off of the backboard and into the basket. On this attempt, the shooter put the correct amount of side spin on the ball and it spins off of the backboard and directly into the basket. doing the mic and drill and we're going for a left hand layup on the left side of the basket he does the correct footwork as you see he jumps off of his right foot again his knee is pretty low and not near his waist level we need to get that knee up higher on the jump so we can explode and jump higher so we can release the ball at its highest point The shooter shows the proper footwork for doing the mic and drill off of one foot. When we're going to the right and we're shooting the ball with our right hand, we want to make sure that we jump off of this left foot. As he jumps, you can see his right knee is below the level of his waist. Ideally, we want to jump and lift that knee up to where it's the level of our waist. That gives us the momentum and it creates the thrust in order for us to explode up into the air and reach the highest point of our jump before we release the ball. His knee is so low that he is not jumping to his maximum capability and releasing the ball at its highest point. When we're doing the mic and drill, we want to try to release the ball at the highest point of our jump. we take a look at the placement of the ball on the backboard we can see that it's slightly outside the square and the height in which it hit the backboard you can see here is just below the top portion of the square so with the placement of the ball on the backboard here we need to make sure we have good side spin and have enough side spin on the ball so when it hits the basket it can come over and spin off the backboard and go into the basket before gravity takes over and it drops down and hits the rim and we miss it short on this attempt he had side spin on the ball but he didn't put enough side spin on the ball so it was spin and headed in the direction of the basket but it dropped down and hit the front the left portion of the basket before it was able to go fully into the basket with the amount of side spin that he put on this shot he needed to place the ball higher on the backboard somewhere here in this area above the square in order for it to spin off the backboard and then drop down into the basket the placement that he put the ball since it was slightly below the top portion of the square it needed much more side spin so it can spin off the backboard quickly and get it over into the basket before it dropped down due to gravity As he makes the layup and the ball comes through the basket and comes down, he catches the ball and allows the ball to drop down to his waist level.

They had no difficulty when changing from one key to the next and continuing on with their series. They are now performing the same major scale at a faster tempo. They are continuing to demonstrate proper finger crossing technique in both the left and right hands. You can also see that both the left and right hand fingers are curved or rounded over the keys.

They again did a great job at transitioning from a softer, more delicate section of their piece into a more louder, fuller section of the piece that has some more intensity to it. Here the pianist did a good job at quickly shifting tonalities. They were playing previously in a different key and now are playing this next section or phrase in a new key. Here the pianist is playing an incorrect chord in their left hand part. Again here, an extra key or incorrect pitch was played due to finger aim. Right hand finger 3 bumped into an extra key so an incorrect pitch was heard here, but the pianist is continuing on and maintaining a steady tempo while they continue performing the rest of this phrase. Here the pianist is playing a very rhythmically challenging phrase in their piece. You see them hand crossing as well as finger crossing to play the rapid succession of notes, and they are doing so with proper technique. In this section of the piece, the pianist is doing a great job at playing with a legato, or smooth and connected articulation. Most of the time, they are also incorporating accented notes or notes with a stronger attack that sound a bit more aggressive into their phrase to make it sound more interesting and musical. Here the pianist did a great job at watching their right hand fingers and making sure they expanded their fingers and that they land it on the correct keys to play the next pitches in the phrase. Here, the low E flat played by the left hand thumb sounded rather loud and abrupt. This was due to the nature of the instrument and the pianist did not intend to play this pitch louder than the rest of the pitches in their phrase. Here the pianist is doing a great job at continuing to play with a legato articulation and they are showing control, they are playing at a softer dynamic level. Here the pianist successfully shifted their left hand a great distance on the piano. They were playing some lower pitches towards the left side of the piano, and they quickly moved more towards the middle or center of the piano and landed on the correct key to play the next pitch in the phrase. Here you can see the pianist demonstrating great left and right hand position. All of their fingers are curved over the keys of the piano, which is helping them perform this phrase with clear, correct pitches. Here you can see both the left and right hand fingers are extended to cover and play a wider range of pitches. Here you can see that I'm pressing down right hand fingers 1, 3, and 5 to play this particular chord and the right hand fingers are curved or rounded over the keys. The pianist is now continuing to play their bass line part in just the left hand, and they are playing the melodic line in their right hand. Here the pianist played an incorrect pitch with their right hand pinky at first. They played this black key on the piano and then they quickly slid their pinky to correct their mistake in pitch and to play the correct key that was needed. Here the pianist did a good job at transitioning to their next section of the piece smoothly. They were previously playing with a louder, fuller dynamic level and their notes had stronger attacks and now they are playing at a softer, more delicate dynamic level with legato or smooth and connected notes. Here you can see the pianist quickly gliding their right hand fingers across numerous black keys of the piano, which allows them to play a sequence of notes very rapidly, and it adds a cool sound effect to the piece. Again, here the pianist is doing a good job at varying their melody. They are adding some grace notes or extra notes to embellish this phrase. The pianist is doing a great job at aligning their right and left hand parts together rhythmically and they are making some nice choices with articulation. You hear them accenting or emphasizing certain notes as well as playing some notes in the phrase more staccato or short and separated. The pianist is performing their second piece. They are playing with a beautiful legato articulation. Their notes are smooth and connected. They are playing more of an accompaniment part in their left hand and the melodic line in their right hand. The pianist did not let their few mistakes in pitch affect the rest of the phrase. They are continuing on in maintaining a steady tempo and playing the rest of the phrase with pitch accuracy. The pianist is continuing to perform this section of the piece with great pitch accuracy at a full loud volume level. The pianist is performing this section of the piece with a full loud dynamic level and they are playing with great pitch and rhythmic accuracy. Here the pianist is doing a great job at performing these two pitches repeatedly and rapidly with right hand fingers three and four. Here they are starting to add some accented or emphasized notes to build up the intensity of this phrase. The pianist is continuing to perform this piece with great stylistic choices. They are playing with great musicality and pitch and rhythmic accuracy. Here the pianist is doing a great job at gradually slowing down towards the end of this phrase which will allow them to transition more naturally and musically into their next section of the piece. The pianist is performing a bass line in their left hand part, and they are performing chords in their right hand part. They are playing both parts with great pitch accuracy, and they are shifting from one chord shape to the next very effortlessly. Again here the pianist did a great job at transitioning from a louder, more aggressive section of the piece to a very soft, delicate section instantly and seamlessly. It would help to watch the right hand fingers a bit more here to make sure that they are landing on the correct keys to play the pitches that are needed in this phrase. The right hand is shifting on the keyboard repeatedly to cover different ranges of pitches in the melody, and each time they are shifting, they are landing on the correct key and playing the pitch that is needed next in the phrase. Here you see the pianist crossing their right hand under their left hand to play the next pitches in their phrase. It sounded like there may have been an error in pitch made here. It would help to review and practice each hand's part alone a few times, checking for pitch accuracy, Here the pianist is playing an incorrect pitch with their right hand pinky. The aim of the pinky seems to be off again. They are playing a C when they should be playing a B, which is one white key to the left or a half step lower. The pianist is playing their lower pitches in their left hand and they are playing chords or multiple pitches at the same time in their right hand part. They are shifting from one chord to the next with great pitch accuracy. Here the pianist is performing a baseline part using their left and right hands. You can see the left hand fingers are extended to cover a wider range of notes. They are also using fingers 2 and 3 on the right hand to perform this part. The pianist is doing a good job at continuing to shift great distances on the keyboard with their left hand. They were playing a more smooth, delicate phrase in the piece that was higher in range and they quickly shifted here to this spot on the keyboard more towards the left of the instrument to play a more aggressive, louder phrase in the piece. They were successful at transitioning from one style to the next. They quickly shifted their left hand and moved their left hand pinky to the next highest black key on the piano to correct their mistake in pitch and they are continuing on with the rest of their phrase. Again, here the pianist is doing a great job at shifting to different spots on the keyboard to cover and play a wider range of notes in this phrase. Here, when performing the chord progression in the left hand part, the pianist could have slowed down a bit more gradually to make this transition into the next section of the piece sound more natural and flowing. Here you can see some finger crossing in the left hand part as the pianist is traveling towards lower pitches on the keyboard. The pianist is continuing to shift their left hand back and forth to different spots on the keyboard very quickly and accurately. Here the pianist has shifted their style of playing. They are playing a jazzier sounding piece now with some syncopated rhythms. The pianist is performing this section of the piece with nice legato or smooth and connected notes. They are maintaining a steady playing speed and are playing with great pitch and rhythmic accuracy. Here you see the pianist using their right hand fingers to play the white keys of the piano. They are moving right to left on the keyboard quickly to play these pitches in rapid succession. That pianist is continuing to play the melody in their right hand part as well as some chords or when multiple pitches are played at once. The pianist is doing a great job at playing this piece at an even consistent tempo with a nice full clear tone. They are adding some grace notes to their melody to embellish it a bit. Here the pianist did a great job again at transitioning into this next section of the piece. They are playing with a very beautiful, delicate, clear tone and at a softer dynamic level. You can see the pianist is alternating between using their left hand thumb and Fingers two and three at the same time on the right hand. So they're doing thumb two and three thumb two and three back and forth to play this repeating pitch with a faster speed and rhythm It's not typical to use two fingers to play one key at the same time, but they may be doing this to Play a bit faster and have a bit more strength and weight to their sound Here, there is the slightest bit of hesitation before beginning the next phrase of the piece. It would help to practice the previous phrase in the piece leading into this next phrase a few times to get this transition to go more smoothly and to be able to maintain a more consistent tempo here.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The ball, his hand is under the ball, which indicates he's probably going to try to put some English on it versus powering up. So just being aware of this drill, you want to have two hands on it. Two hands are going up at the same time and flicking your wrist with the left hand and finding the best spot on the backboard to give yourself a chance to make a layup. Good job coming off the left foot, finishing with the right hand.  Grabbing it with one hand is not ideal. You want to grab that thing with two hands, alright, and protect it at all times. Being able to come this high off the ground indicates one of two things. Either you're not getting enough flexion in your knees, or the effort and speed you're giving is not good enough. In this case, it's probably both. It's obvious.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And as the climber is swinging herself back and forth, we can see that she is focusing a lot on how much her arms are pulling her up and down. So as she's getting this movement, it's kind of a good idea to do this back and forth, where it's giving the climber the idea of the type of movement that they're going to be committing to. However, by focusing on her upper body here, she's not really focusing so much on what's going on with her lower body, which could make it hard to complete the move. Just because our legs are stronger muscles, and they will always produce more power. So it's always kind of nice to make sure that the climber is focused a little bit more on what's going on with their legs, and trying to keep their arms straight to help produce the accurate amount of power that they need. So here we can see the climber is committing to going for that long pillow hold over to her left right now. And as she's committing to the move, we can see how much both of her arms are in a flexed position. So again, this kind of shows how much the climber is focusing on her upper body to complete this movement. But because she's pulling so much with the upper body, this is actually displacing some of her body weight on her left foot. And as a result, we can see that her left foot is sliding off of that full hold that she was on. So this prevents her from completely getting to this yellow hold that she's aiming for. So I would definitely encourage the climber to kind of keep her arms a little bit straighter and reinforce how much she's using her left leg. So then that way you can help prevent that left foot from sliding off the full hold. And that way she can also use the power from that foot to guide her up in the direction that she needs to.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The player takes a step back, puts weight on the right foot, takes weight off the left foot, but then puts weight back on the left foot and just brings the inside of the foot through the ball. Again, kind of a low quality end result due to low quality foundation on the shot in terms of approaching angle, approaching distance, approaching speed and our stance. So we see a little bit more trajectory in this one a little bit more of a lift and hitting higher point of the goal, but This is not really due to more power more so due to Connecting the bottom of the ball so we can see The curve of the ball on connection meaning the foot is right underneath that curve Hitting the lower part of the ball, which is going to cause it to go higher So still Want to see a little bit more power in these ones and the straighter the line here Would mean the more power that's in the shot So the fact that this kind of goes up and drops in means it is losing power very fast while it's in the air Again just a one-step approach and we see right foot opened out and arms down by the side. Again just looks like more of a passing technique than a shooting technique. next kick approach here see the left foot is back around here left foot point in this direction right foot standing in pointing more forward and just a little bit of a twist from facing here to facing here and follow through but again pretty weak in terms of the power just kind of left footer low not very hard so overall just not a great shot So see the next shot here. Players just kind of place the ball legs length away from where they are standing which is somewhere around here and here and they're just about to take one step in. A shot which results in a wide. We'll see that it goes over here. Not a whole lot of power. Not a whole lot of quality in this one. And probably because of the very short distance approach, kind of a rushed shot, not really set up with our foundations of our approaching angle or our approaching distance. Again just kind of rolled out, jump in, take a shot and not really premeditating this one. Another one on the left, a super short approach. Players basically looking down on the ball before they take the shot here. So again, just no approach, no power generated before the connection with the ball. We do see probably one of the better points of entry, it goes into the bottom corner but without the power, without any sort of power, it doesn't really make a difference on the penalty kicks. Just to look at again the stance here. Right footed shot generally when we see someone taking a right footed shot or they're trying to kick the ball far, this left arm is usually out here, somewhere between here and here. This arm here is down low as is this one. And it's just again stepping in from here into here, inside of the foot, opened up and it's just more of a passing technique into the net. So again I don't know if this player is just aiming to just hit the net, if they're really trying to generate power, accuracy or whether the idea is just to go low, central and just get it in there eventually. Again, just back to the central point of entry below. Not super hard inside of the foot used. So just a low quality shot here. Again, just a slight more of an effort to generate power and a longer step on that one step approach here. But again, we see arms down by the side, inside of the foot, low trajectory, just more of a passing style shot into the goal versus a run up and a shoot. Here we see what we call a half volley, so the ball is on the way, it's taking a bounce and it's on its way up. As the ball is coming up, the player brings their foot in and just connects with this one on its way up. And the idea is it gives it a little bit of a lift into position. Usually these ones are hit with the laces, are chopped down on with the inside of the foot to achieve a lot of power, using the up-bounce to their advantage. This here is just the player, I think, playing around with the ball, trying something a little bit different. It ends up being a good shot, but I think the idea was just to kind of hit the goal. Not sure what the idea is in terms of getting it bouncing, but good trajectory from the foot, an okay amount of power. Definitely on the half volley there's a lot more room for improvement. So in this video we are going to be looking at penalty kicks or shooting. It looks like the distance right now is about six to seven maybe eight yards at a push from the goal to the ball and then we see the goal here pretty small in comparison to a normal full-sized goal and so that will have me judge the accuracy a little bit harder. When it's a smaller goal we want to see that it's getting to the outsides a little bit more closer to the post and especially from such a short distance here we want to see probably a little bit more accuracy to our corners and to our outsides and our bottom corners and under the crossbar and basically anything that's away from this kind of goalkeeper area in the middle we want to see again outside corners and so we look at the technique, the connection, the power trajectory, our point of entry, accuracy, the angle of the approach and run-up length and then just the overall body shape in relation to the direction of the kick and the approach to the kick before and during connection of the kick. Here one of the better points of entry. Coming low and hitting kind of the inside of the post or the inside of the second post behind the first post meaning that it's entered pretty to the side. Again not sure there is much aiming here or whether it's just ended up going in this corner and the player did not line it up with a lot of thought or with a lot of steps. So again I think just trying to hit the target and seeing where it goes. Kind of hard to see on the right hand side screen here but we can see this left foot has come very low and forward through the ball and it's already grounded. So the foot has almost been dragged along the floor and that is causing this one to be lower in power. The player is just again kind of leaned almost forward through it but no pullback in the foot before the shot. Just kind of trying to walk through the ball and nudge it into the goal. As we can see just upon the connection, just after the connection, the player's stance, body shape, just kind of in a walking shape here, we see the arms down by the side, this arm down by the side, so not trying to generate, at least not achieving, generating much power. Sometimes we see players kick with one-step approach, but they at least try to plant and jump into it to generate that power in the kick. This is just kind of very, very casual, okay with connecting with low power and just hitting it into the goal any old way, instead of actually trying to hit a penalty kick that would have the capability of beating a goalkeeper. So here, seeing an optimal point of entry, not the most optimal but it hits the inside of the post and still ends up in the goal so it is one of the furthest points away from the centre of the goal that you can get with still being on target and having a chance of being in goal. So in terms of making a save here, even if there is a goalkeeper in this goal, these ones are always some of the hardest ones to save because they hit the inside of the post. Goalies don't know exactly where they are going to hit. Sometimes they think they are going to hit the post and come back out or hit the post and go wide or even just go wide from the off. So in terms of point of entry, probably the best one so far posted in in this video. But also we got a look at where the shot was taken from. It's a pretty straight line. So the player is maybe just playing that straight pass which somehow hits the inside of the post and goes across the goal. So here just to talk about the approach and angle and the approach length. This is one step, the players just kind of place the ball here with one foot, right foot now takes a step back into this area, left foot about to jump in and then right foot opened up inside of the foot connecting with this one and we'll see again kind of rises up and bounces down and into the goal so just not a whole lot of power and that is down to the approach more so, a little bit to do with the technique as well but I feel like even with this technique a little bit of a run-up will give the technique more power So we see our first shot here. The player just took a one-step approach. Not much of a plant, not trying to generate much power, and that reflects in this bounce here before the ball even enters the goal. It takes a bounce with not much height, so just kind of this type of trajectory here. A little bounce into the goal. So very low on power, central entry point, overall low quality penalty kick or shot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And now you can hear that melody and it's doubled so she's playing that in octaves with the thumb and fifth finger You can hear those trills right there. The fingers are nice and curved. Hand position is good. Technique is good. And again, it's very well executed. You can see the left hand coming up and down the keyboard here with arpeggios and going back and forth, and she has a, she's maintaining a good hand position, and those are nice and even and steady. Right there, you can kind of see and it's right in this section her fingers keep lifting and it looks like she's almost turning The pianist is doing a nice job of bringing out the melody that you can hear over a top of the underlying harmonic things going as well. At this point, she has hit a couple of incorrect pitches, but overall the flow is still going well. This is a nice little contrasting section here. The tempo has picked up and it is a little bit more busy. There's a really lovely balance between the two hands right here. They're not quite playing an octave apart, but they have that, it looks like a sixth. And so you can hear like the harmony, both of the notes are really brought out. And so you can hear that, you can hear the mesh of the harmony working well together. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  here there are a couple of incorrect pitches as she's doing those big arpeggio jumps Right here, she moved from this position down here. There were a couple of incorrect notes. And now we're back to the slower theme that we've heard previously, and the left hand is being a little bit more direct in its phrasing and playing more into the melody. So right here, the left hand has this little dun dun dun dun underneath, and the right hand has that pulsing da da da da da da da. And each hand is independent of each other, and they're doing a nice job with complementing each other. Now that tempo starts to slow it down again, there's a bit of a retard and it's getting a bit softer. You can see she still has really good hand position and is maintaining that. Right there you can see Here the tempo is accelerating a bit and the piano is, the flow is staying, the phrasing is still staying nice and consistent. And the tempo is moving much quicker and pushing ahead. It's a lot busier again. With those left-hand notes, we are hearing that a little bit more prominently, and it is bringing that out and more aware. The pianist has a very lovely touch. She has good finger technique and good posture as she is performing. Right here you can see the melody that you're hearing in those higher pitches. Right here you can see the left hand seamlessly comes over to take over that motif that the right hand had previously been playing. Again, there are a couple of incorrect pitches as she's moving back and forth here. In that section right here, she is playing those individual notes. I don't know if the fingerings are marked or not. I imagine they may or may not be, but it seemed that she was doing them maybe more difficult than it needed to be. So either breaking that apart and doing that in smaller sections or writing in those fingerings to make sure that it is clean and consistent so she's not reaching in her fingers. It seemed a little bit unnatural there. This is a very difficult passage as she's going up and back down. And she is doing that. It's very well executed. In here, there's a lot of busy motion happening, but with the right hand, we're still hearing that melody brought out. In this section, the pianist is playing more rubato, which literally means to steal time. And so you can hear how the tempo is pushing forward at some points and pulling back at other points. And she's doing that seamlessly. Whether or not that's written in the music, I'm assuming that it is because it sounds like it sounds very authentic, but without confirming on the music, I'm unsure. Right here, she's playing very delicately, I would say at the piano pianissimo level. The right hand, the melody is still being brought out, which is great, and she has a nice touch here with her left hand. The pianist appears to be sight reading this material and as she goes throughout, her body is leaning inward to look more closely at the music. However, she maintains her good technique and consistent tempo throughout. Now there's a bit more of a lilt in there, and each hand is still complementing each other well.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

You can see it's got a pretty big spread beyond an octave to play those. And they're using a really nice sway of motion from back and forth here to create that necessity. Really nice progression in the scale here, very even over the course of each speed, and then the variation in the speed was very marked with a consistent tempo as well. Crossovers of the fingers looked great.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This is creating a really dense sound, but they could actually use a little bit more so it's more present. If you notice, it does the same finger shift. They bring back their second finger and create a little bit of a slide that creates some expressiveness in the music. The violist has a little bit of vibrato here and then dissipated. They should make sure that their vibrato is a little bit more constant. The vules has a slight vibrato in their hand going. They can work on having more of a continuous vibrato that they're transferring their vibrato between one finger to another. The fuel just adds a little bit of weight into the string to accent these notes. They could probably actually do a little bit more to help match their duet partner who is giving a lot. The violist brings up their viola to create a cue so that they know when to play with their duet partner. The Buells is using less speed in the bow currently to create more of a denser sound. The Vuel starts at the tip of the bow for a softer sound. To release the sound, the violist is taking the bow off the string and having to follow through with it. This will get more ring in the string. He also uses a good full bow to get a fuller sound. The viola is playing with a straight bow that's parallel with the bridge. This is great for a consistent, clean sound. As they're getting closer to the frog, they're adding more weight to create a crescendo.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

If they were to drop their pelvis back more while maintaining this nice bend in their knees, it would be more grounded, which would give them more control over the movements in general. As the dancer performs a series of small and quick movements leading up to this body roll, they are able to stay connected to the rhythm primarily through their feet, however they are struggling to deeply embody the rhythm through the rest of their body, particularly their upper body. Here they are including their head in the body roll, which shows that they understand the sequence of movements, however they are lacking fluidity in their upper body, torso, and pelvis in general. As the dancer begins with the basic salsa step, he demonstrates that he has an understanding of the movement vocabulary by incorporating his arms choreographically as well as his feet and staying connected to the rhythm through his lower body. He's got a nice bend in his knees, though he needs to drop the pelvis back more to be more grounded in his movement and also get some additional clarity in the movement of his upper body, which is quite extraneous at the moment. If you were to pull back on this movement and refine it and find some clarity, he would be able to move more quickly and efficiently. Here the dancer struggles to transition from one step to the next. He appears that maybe he forgot the choreography or fell off rhythm in a way and needs to catch the next upbeat. However, in this moment he kind of takes on this very pedestrian stance with his arms at his side and his knees in kind of a neutral lunge, which shows that he's struggling to transition from one step to another, which could be solved just with some additional rehearsal of the choreography. As the dancer transitions to a salsa step moving forwards and backwards, they're able to stay connected to the rhythm, particularly through the use of their feet. While they're including their arms choreographically, they're doing so in a way that's throwing them off the rhythm slightly and overall making their movement appear stiff and off-rhythm.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She's just sort of moving her feet in these nonspecific, imprecise patterns. The arms are not really specific or precise either. So it's really not giving us anything to really latch onto as an audience. This is a really nice shape. She just had her hands on her head and straightened up her elbows and brought her hands down in this really beautiful, graceful position. However, it's compromised by the lack of attack to get here. She sort of just laxadaisically raises her arms up. It just, again, looks bored, looks monotone. I'd love to see more attack, more pizzazz, more personality shining through. And again, legs are really, really weak. I don't think she's really aware of what's happening down here. I think that she needs to work on reconnecting her upper and lower halves while she's dancing and use her whole body for her dancing. Again, lack of precision, lack of exaggeration. It's very unclear exactly what she's supposed to be doing here. It looks stiff. Good energy here through this movement. I think that this is something that she does really well and I'd love her to embrace the energy of this. There's more energy coming through her legs as she's stepping through here. She's coordinating her arms with this nice counterbalance between the arms and legs and she's just really dynamically moving forward and attacking the movement. So I'd love to see her embrace that and move through that same way throughout the whole piece. She's doing a pretty good job with these rib isolations, but she's looking off to the side. She's in a weak position here with her feet. They're too close together. They're not facing in the same direction. This would be a lot stronger if this were a more exaggerated movement, if she was gazing out at her audience, and if she had a stronger foundation to stand on. Good follow through with the arm here. The hand has come in front of the face and all the way behind the head, which is a really nice example of following through with movements and not cutting them off too early. Here's an example of a poor transition again low energy low not much exaggeration she's got totally straight knees here straight knees are not typically a good place to start a movement from especially if she's preparing for something here and that's also partly why it looks low energy because there's not a softness through the knee there's not springiness through the knee and springiness is what creates you know tension in the viewers mind and also makes it look energetic her arms again not specific a lot of tension through this hand and she's also sort of frozen in this moment and so this is very obviously a transition moment I'd like to see her do a bigger leap into this foot so that she could get more momentum as she turns here. Again, not exaggerated enough, way too small to really read very well. Again, lack of energy, lack of attack. This ball change here could have been such a nice surprising moment if she had added a little bit of a leap into it, a little bit more energy into it, but she again is very monotone in her dancing in this video. She's doing her turn here. She is slightly on the ball of this foot, which is good. That means that's a little bit of a smaller pivot point. This leg has come up and around but the position of the leg is very imprecise. It's sort of just hanging in front of her. Her foot is just sort of hanging there. So there's not a lot of clarity or strength in what she's doing here. Again, looks low energy. Arms are also quite non-specific. This one is really quite stiff actually and tense as she's coming through, probably because she's so focused on turning. I would just recommend again, something with the arms in a very clear shape or using the arms to give her more momentum to turn. This is a nice moment because she's got a little bit of a bounce to what she's doing and as she bounces this way she released her neck which was really nice to see because it's previously been kind of tense and she bounced it really really well at the right moment in terms of the music. This arm is coming back in a nice arc with a straight elbow. Would like to see more energy out the fingers but regardless it's a nice pathway. I like that this arm is also coming forward and she's gazing down which emphasizes this line. Really nice moment for her here. So she started her turn over here going in this direction and now she's kind of flailing this way and that's because she didn't set herself up for success very well and she's also using her hips to help her to as her pivot point which is not effective keeping this net flat foot. She's also not spotting her head so she's totally losing track of where she is in space and it's causing her to spiral this way in a clunky looking way. I can also see again collapsing in her knee. I think what she really might need are some insoles in her shoes. I think that she has a tendency to pronate which is really common because we can see this shape happening here and it's going to be bad for her knees over time. I also think she needs to strengthen the muscles around her knee joints. That's really the best way to keep the knees nice and strong rather than collapsing in. So she keeps this super deep plie here, which is not helpful, especially because she also has a flat foot. So this is not helping her turn. This is making the turn, again, have this sort of undulating, bouncy, awkward heaviness to it, rather than precision. Again, she's not using her plie here to help her. She's getting ready for another turn, which is going to happen, supposed to happen on this left foot. And she's got the plie reversed. She's got her plie on the foot she's going to turn on, which means that she's not going to get her weight effectively onto that leg and is also going to have to fight against gravity to push up onto this leg. It's not going to help her at all. Another thing is that she's turned both hips, she's externally rotated both hips, so probably conceiving of her pivot point as her hip and is going to be turning the rest of her body around her hip, which is not effective either. So what she needed to do first was have a plie with this leg and then quickly transfer weight into the ball of this foot with a relatively straight knee in order to make this turn look nice and smooth and to be technically correct. She started a nice windmill arm shape with both sides, or arm pathway with both arms, but she's lost the windmill shape, or the straight arm shape, too early, and so we can't really see the full completion and follow-through of that windmill, which was really nice at the beginning, so I'd love to see her work on that follow-through. So she's a little bit late for the music here. There's a big cymbal crash that was probably meant to coincide with her kick. It doesn't, so it looks like she's behind the beat. Also the kick is not exaggerated enough. None of her movements are exaggerated enough so they aren't coming across as performative. Her kick barely gets her knee even close to being straight. And that's because she doesn't give it enough attack. So it's too slow and doesn't have enough music to complete the movement. The arms are also quite imprecise and weak. And her head is sort of jutted forward in this kind of poor posture here. So here she's again in a very weak stance with these hips turned in towards each other, a straight knee here, a little bit of a bent knee here, really really imprecise shape and also a very weak shape to be moving from. She's moving only her neck and her shoulders a little bit here and so it just again there's a lack of coordination between the lower and upper halves of her body which is very obvious to a viewer. I do think this is a pretty strong shape with these elbows out away from her head. She's done a pretty good job here with this wider stance and she does seem to be driving this movement across her body with her arm by rotating the pelvis and spine so that's good initiation there. I'd love to see her push a bit more through this foot but regardless this is a good plie. This is a pretty good arm it's a little bit more curved than I think it should be. I think this would be a more effective pathway if it were a straight elbow. Good shape here with the arms, nice graceful fingers and hands. However, she again doesn't attack it, so it's lacking texture, but also prevents her from holding this shape at all because she doesn't attack it. She gets there on the beat, but too late to be able to hold this. And so it doesn't read very well as a shape. Again, no attack here, not much interest here with this step in front. It's a little bit slow, it's a little bit bored. It's almost like she's bored or not marking what she's doing rather than doing it full out, which makes it not super interesting to watch. Again, she's reversed the plie. She really should be plieing with this front leg and moving on to a straight knee or relatively straight knee. You can also see her knee collapsing inward here, so this is a really weak position to be starting a turn from. The arms do look really strong, nice technique with the straight elbow and energy out the fingertips and the way she's raising her arm, she's not overusing her shoulders, which looks really clear and clean. Here she's beginning to transfer her weight onto her back foot for a turn, but this is a really incorrect position or inefficient position to get her to do into that shape. What would have been a much better choice is a plie through this leg, not this one, so that she could use that as a spring to push off of to get the weight onto the back foot. And what she's done instead is now her weight is all the way back here. It's gonna make her turn be off balance as she goes backward. She's kind of moving her elbows front and back here. I think she maybe was supposed to be doing a shimmy so she needs to work on figuring out where the initiation of the shimmy is which is the shoulders. Great movement with the arms. She prepared it really well in front of her body. Nice straight elbow as she brings it around. She's doing a good arc here. Good energy out of the fingertips. Nice grace through the fingers and wrist. Nice straight elbow, but again lacking dynamic and texture. There was no attack to it either and so her dancing just looks sort of monotone, which is not what we need. In dance we need some arc. We need some dynamics. We need some different unexpected movements and motions and texture. Also the music itself has quite a sharpness and a fieriness to it that she's not reflecting in her dancing.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

It'd be good for them just to practice slowly and play the chords as blocks, take off their hands, bring it back to the keyboard and just play again, just to get some good old-fashioned target practice so they feel very familiar with the keys. Also, when shifting, they're leading a lot with their hands and then their body is following. It would be helpful for them to lead with their body first, then their arms and their hands come follow after. This would be a more efficient movement. When starting a new arpeggio, the pianist always plays these chords a lot of times. It'd be good for them to just play with a metronome and just make sure that when they practice, they're moving just with the beat every single time. It's a really bad habit to try to get rid of, but they just need to make sure that they don't play notes again, just always keep moving. Again, for my last comment, the pianist is playing with really straight fingers and their hand is a little bit far away from the keyboard. If they were to bring it closer and have more of a curved hand, this would allow them to feel like they have a more structured hand so that when they move, they have the built-in chord shape. Whenever they're leaping from one position to another, it's often very quick. As they're getting towards the end of their previous position, they can start to anticipate their movement so it's more gradual and slower to go to this next leap. Again, I think that the pianista is really far away with the position of their chair. It could be up a little bit further, but especially whenever they're playing up in these higher positions, you can see that both arms are reaching quite a bit. Again, this is another example that the pianist's thumbs are really far off the keyboard. It's because they're pretty far away from the keyboard in general. They can move their seat to be maybe closer, just so that they feel like they have more immediacy to play all these notes. The pianist is trying to find all these right notes and just playing them over and over again. Again, from my last comment, you can see that their hands are very straight, which I feel like whenever they're playing, they're just thinking about their fingers playing individual notes. If they had more of a curved handshape, they would feel like they have all the chords just right there because of the natural handshape. The pianist is playing with flat fingers, which is not helpful for their coordination. They can try to get their hand closer to the keyboard and curve their hand so they can use their fingertips. Again, this is another example that the pianist is shifting up the keyboard rather quickly, which is resulting with them having a mistake. They should try to make sure that they anticipate the shift and know exactly where they're going. They always have more time than they think, so anytime they make a mistake, they're moving way too fast. Since their hand is so far away from the keyboard, when they're going up for their thumb here, they really have to reach and try to pivot. This movement is unnecessary if they were just to be a little bit closer, their hand overall closer to the keyboard. Their thumb would naturally just be there. The pianist is testing a couple different notes just to make sure that they're grounded in their position. They should make sure that they practice more frequently so they feel very comfortable where their hands are on the keyboard. Whenever the pianist has a leap with the left hand, they're always taking a lot of time to try to figure out where they're going. They're utilizing their forearm really well just to get down there, but they just need to make sure that they practice the previous chord to the next chord back and forth so they know exactly where they should be going. They can also think about that they're shifting with the whole hand for all the notes there instead of just feeling, trying to find out where the pinky's going.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So he's kicking one and two and three, backwards on four and. That's very good. He got back on rhythm, but most of his dancing in general is not on rhythm with the music that is playing. Again, these circular movements in which he's raising his arm to turn the dancer or his imaginary partner are not really necessary. It's also difficult to practice this because there is no partner to measure the height of. If the dancer is taller, for instance, his arm would have to be extended higher up. If the dancer was shorter, his imaginary partner, then he would have to be moving his arm further down. So it's good to know that you'd be turning a dancer or a partner potentially, but because he is dancing solo, he should be fully engaged in dancing by himself instead of with an imaginary partner that doesn't exist. The dancer's feet here are a bit lazy when he's doing the triple step 1, 2, 3. Step 1, his feet should be apart, but step 2, his feet should come closer together, and then step 3, they would be apart again. He doesn't really ever complete step 2 in which his feet are together, so it should be clearly apart, together, apart, or 1, 2, 3, but the together part here is missing. When the dancer is kicking his legs forward into the side, he should be extending his energy further out of his head so that he's standing tall, especially he is a tall person to begin with, but he's not using his verticality fully. He's not engaging all of it. So he can make his body even longer by extending out of his head his energy upward. The dancer is doing a good job of facing all different directions. He faces various parts of the room. His body is facing all different ways, which is good. It shows that he can dance three-dimensionally and use each direction in the space. The dancer is off rhythm here. The music is very fast and he is not dancing fast enough to keep up with the rhythm of the music so his musicality here is off. He can't make sure that he is on rhythm entirely or continuously by making sure that he is counting at the same pace from beginning to end and not speeding up. Each count that he's saying should be equidistant from the last count that he just said. So each number that he says should be the same amount of time apart from the last one that he said. The dancer is kicking his legs outward with energy. He's also jumping up and down when he's kicking them both forwards and backwards and he does a good job of straightening his legs. He can work on now straightening his legs even further and kicking them out with even more energy but what he is doing is a good start. It's also important for him not to be doing these arm movements that he would be doing with a partner, given no partner is present, because these arm movements also are a consequence or a result of having a connection with your partner. It's not just putting your arm up to turn the partner, it's him and this partner connecting and timing and in rhythm and in energy together to be turned. So it's not really as efficient to just practice the arm movements here without knowing if the partner would be ready then. And also he and the partner's arms would be moving together in space lifting up and him just practicing lifting his arm movements right now by himself, prepares him to be not connected with his partner, to be disconnected with his partner when they would be dancing together. So it's better off that he is not practicing these arm movements like this because it would just emphasize him being disconnected and not actually working with that partner in tandem with each other. Again, on these rock steps, if his arm is going to be extended like this for a partner, he has to really practice in his upper body pulling backwards since the partner would be holding hands with him and also would be pulling backwards. So in this instance, his arm really should be straight because the tension from each other would be pulling them apart even though they're remaining connected at their hands. Their arms should be straight as their backs would be pulling away. So he's not really practicing this step completely. He's missing that weight balance or the weight shift part where he'd be pulling backwards in space towards our right side of the screen away from his partner, his imaginary partner. The dancer is sometimes looking downward, which isn't necessary, especially if he's practicing to dance with a partner. Eye contact would be very important. So he has to practice with his eyes upright because he would be making eye contact with his partner either to, if he's the leader, to be directing his partner on which way and how fast or wherever they're going, the steps he would be in charge of. So it's important that he would be communicating through his eyes and making eye contact with his partner to make sure that they're in coordination with each other. So it's better off that he starts lifting his head now instead of looking downward. The dancer is bringing his arm over his head as if he is turning a partner or dancing with a partner. This is swing dance so it often is a partner dance but right here he's dancing by himself so mimicking these arm positions that he would do with a partner are not necessary and it actually makes him look a bit awkward because there is no partner there so it's better if he dances as if he is dancing by himself which is what he is doing. The dancer also can't practice hand holds because the partner is not here. So what his hand is doing, he's not able to be interlocking fingers or practicing a transition of where the hands would glide against each other. And it would be better if he was able to practice that if he had a partner. But since the partner is not there, there's not much of a point in bringing his arm upward like this, especially because he's not going to be actually executing it in the way that's meant to be given a whole person is missing. It's good that the dancer is just freestyling like this before he starts his routine, just to feel the music and to get into his body. This is a good way to prepare before you begin dancing. When the dancer is doing these triple steps, he can be traveling further in space. He's a bit stationary here, staying in one position, but he really has much more of the dance floor to be using. So it would be better if he traveled on those triple steps. The rock steps, when he's crossing his legs behind each other, which is where he is right now, those are meant to be stationary, but those triple steps or one, two, three steps in between can be used not only to change direction as he has been doing well, but also to travel further in space, so to take up all the rest of the space that he has. The dancer is able to change direction on these kicks because he's turning his torso from right to left and from left to right. And that is helping him turn his entire body by leading with this torso area of his body. So once that part of his body turns, his legs are also following suit. So he's able to dance in tandem his upper body and his lower body because they're directionally facing the same way. The dancer should make sure when he's doing the triple steps or the one, two, three fast steps in a series of three that his weight is shifted onto his toes. That way he can travel across the ground easily and is not hindering himself by having his heels on the floor. It's much harder to travel once your heels are on the floor and it prohibits you from traveling quickly and easily. This arm movement in which he would be extending his arm out and the other dancer, that would be his partner, would be pulling away from him. So they would be pulling away from each other. Is not very efficient to be practicing here either because he doesn't have the counterbalance. He doesn't have the weight of the other person that would be present here for him to be pulling away from. If it's very imperative for him to be practicing his arm movements as if there was a partner, then he really should here be pulling his torso backwards into space. Because in reality, if he was dancing with another partner that was here and connecting arms with him, that partner would also be pulling backwards into space. So there would be more tension in his extended hand, his left hand that's extended. It would be kind of like a rubber band. They would be pulling apart. And he doesn't really have that elasticity or he's not demonstrating that elasticity, which is difficult to practice by yourself. But he can help himself practice by pulling his weight and his upper body backwards, as if that person was also there pulling backwards. He has to kind of create that elasticity and that type of tension in his arms for himself right here since the weight of his partner is not there to assist him. The dancer is preparing to start his movement but he is a bit awkward in doing this. His arms and his legs are moving which is fine and good but they're moving a bit independent from his spine. So both his arms and his legs or these limbs are connected through his center and all come radiating from his spine. So these movements should be further connected to his back because at the end of the day these body parts are connected to the vertebrae. The dancer is also counting in rhythm when he's counting off the music here before he starts dancing. However, towards the end of this counting he begins to speed up a bit which will allow or force him to get off rhythm eventually. If he keeps speeding up he begins completely on rhythm and by the time that he's counting here he's barely on rhythm anymore. He's inching to being off rhythm.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

If she were to be more clear to eliminate that bouncing quality for a more grounded quality where she's really reaching down into the ground through her feet, she would be more connected to the music and have a deeper embodiment of the rhythm. The dancer has a pretty strong command over this swivel step. She has a nice bend in her knees. She's fully executing the swivel through her feet and through her hips as well and she has pretty dynamic arm choreography where the arms are punching or pointing downwards in alignment with the rhythm of the step. Overall she's performing this step quite well. As the dancer moves through the swinging step that takes up much more space than her overall kinosphere, which is kind of the space around her, she performs it with confidence. She could again benefit from a little more bend in the knees, bringing that torso a little bit more forward, which would help her stay more grounded and connected to the rhythm, but overall she has a clear command over this step and she does have a pretty consistent rhythmic embodiment. The dancer is performing this combined audible clap with a kickball change moving backwards in this space. At a fairly intermediate level, she seems to have strong command over the actual body positioning in this movement, as well as the traveling backwards into the space she appears quite clear on. Her kick is strong and her clap is fairly on rhythm, however she really could benefit from grounding into the floor, bending those knees a little bit more deeply, bringing that chest and that upper body more forward over the pelvis, and overall just kind of bending and compressing her movement a little bit closer to the ground, which would help her connect to the rhythm more consistently. As the dancer is performing the step tap out to the side, her upper body movements aren't quite clear enough to be really definitively on the rhythm. She's reaching this arm out in a way that's almost sort of flicking or dabbing in front of her, rather than creating a super direct movement and a very clear shape with her body. As the dancer is performing these series of step touches side to side and swinging her arms up ending in either the appearance of a snap or an actual snap itself of the fingers, she really has command over this step and the repetition of the step is helping her to really sit into the rhythm and connect to the music. Her body choreography itself is quite clear, she appears confident in this movement, and overall she's performing this step in a strong way. The dancer is quite clear in this box step that she's performing, particularly in the choreography of the arms, which you can see this nice clear shape happening here. And she has a nice bend in the knees and there's quite a decent amount of clarity happening through the feet. She is connected to the rhythm, though she could be more connected to the rhythm. She kind of just sits on top of it rather than aligning with the rhythm or really deeply embodying it, which she would benefit from. As the dancer is performing this series of step taps to the side, accented by a jump in the middle, her arms are quite clear in their choreography here, as is her step touch. Her jump in between the step touch, where she jumps out to this wide stance with nice bent knees grounded, appears slightly off rhythm if she were to jump more connected to the music, rather than connecting to the steps in this one-note dynamic way. It would really heighten her performance quality here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

With this move and kind of staying square, I think what he wants to do is rotate that knee back out, then he uses this right foot as kind of a tensioning posting foot and really kind of smear and generate the movement left. So he can go up through that left foot and really engage to get this hold. By twisting, he's gonna have to kind of unravel and where he's twisting at the start, when he hits this hold, it's gonna be kind of more barn door-y and he's not gonna be a straight on, so it's gonna kind of force this kind of right hip out away from the wall. And now here we can see he chooses to match his feet on this hold. So what he could have done is just keep his left foot on there, back flag the right foot. That would save him a foot movement. It would also allow him to keep his hips a little closer to the wall. And kind of shift over that foot even more. Bounce out and bring the right hand up. Instead he kind of does this, he's kind of side stepping on the right. Flagging the left foot out. So he's kind of setting up for a twist lock. You'll notice he doesn't really twist his body into his arm at all. He kind of just twists his torso, his chest into his bicep and forearm. And really twist and sit on top of this hold. He kind of just makes the moves again with his arms. So his feet seem to be kind of just posting on the holds. But not really driving through the holds. It's kind of once again, he's starting off with his arms pretty bent engaged It could be that he's taller and he's a more scrunched position position So he's trying to pull himself off the ground a little bit better I think you could kind of wait into these feet a little bit better So as the knee is kind of facing outwards you kind of bring his Knee up and over so he's kind of applying the force straight down through this hole And that would kind of let him shift his hips up to make the next move And again, as he hits this right hand hold, his lower body doesn't really change too much in position. And so now he's swapping his weight again. So this is where if he had done the backflag, he would have just had his left foot there already and would have saved him those foot moves of swapping and then re-swapping. So we can see here his kind of hips and lower body doesn't move as he gets his left hand up here, which really means this movement is coming from his upper body. So he could have shifted a little bit more into this position.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This climber probably has pretty big hands, so they try and do a little hot swap, so bring the left hand out really fast in hopes for the right hand to come in and its place, but as a result both hands blow.

Now the climber in order to sustain and create pressure on the hold he needs to squeeze the hold and also apply pressure by pulling on the elbows. As we can see both of the elbows are put out different directions because the climber is in the corner at this block. Here the climber has gone for a dynamic reach. This one the climber jumps by pushing his heel hook towards the hold pretty hard and at the moment that he extends it he also was pulling with his right hand on the block to quickly aim the right hand to come into placement to this positive grip. It's positive because the climber is able to apply the hand over the lip and curls the fingers to pull on the lip of the hold and now the climber is bringing his weight over the grip and doing so the climber loses pressure at the heel hook and this one comes out of place due to the dynamic jump to the hold. After the climber was able to make the placement of the left toe on the edge, the climber then brings his left hand quickly onto a match at the same pinch hold and releases the right foot so now the climber keeps the leg extended to transfer over his weight over to the highest foot. The leg extended, this is called flagging out and the climber uses it so that he can keep his hips square when facing the wall as well as balancing over as he will need to keep the leg extended to gain stability. Here the climber was able to pull himself into a closed pull up and keeps the right hand with the elbow pushing down. Once the climber gets the chest as far in as close to the right hand grip, then the climber is able to lock the move and sends the left hand out for the reach. The left hand is placed open handed because he's going for a sloper hold, meaning that the hold is rounded so in order for the climber to stick the move, he will have to open the hand and place it as far in towards the wall. This way the climber has more contact with the surface of the hold. And the climber will have to create friction by placing weight onto the hold, reason why the climber keeps the arm extended and once he is able to retract slightly on the hold while meeting the skin with the pores of the hold, then the climber is able to stick the move. As we can see the climbers right foot has come to a higher stance coming to match the right hand grip Because the climber is placing the heel in This is called a heel hook where the climber sends the heel into the wall and places it behind the lip of the hold Once the climber gets to apply the heel and Secure it this he will use it to engage it by pulling the heel towards him which will catch behind the lip of the hold and can help the climber bring his center of gravity close to the wall and as well as The climber when using the engagement of the heel pushing down it will help the climber to gain height Once he's center of gravity. It's at the same level as where the heel placement is the climber sends the right toe to come into place where the left hand grip is. As we can see he places the toe and pushes down against the hole to apply pressure as he continuously pulls on the grip in order to sustain the grip. Now the climber is able to lean back onto both grips that he has at the moment as he is now bringing his center of gravity away from the wall. He needs to continue to remain close to the wall by pulling hard on the grips while making this foot placement. The next placement would be the climber releasing the left foot in order to find a higher stance. The climber here is getting started at a two hand hold start. As we can see, the top hold is a jug that is much bigger than the left hand hold. The climber will have to apply pressure by placing the hand over the lip of the hold and leaning on the hold once he gets to place weight onto the grip. And for the left hand, we can see how the climber is holding onto a jug that is upside places the finger inside of the hold and cups the hold. In order to sustain the grip, he will have to pull the hold towards him. This placement is an undercling, so the climber is placing the hand from underneath. The climber is continuing to look back and forth between the higher hand being in place and the heel hook. This is because the climber yet hasn't applied sufficient pressure or a proper placement on the heel hook and feels that the hand is slipping away from the hold. He sends then the thumb to be placed under to pinch the block to sustain the grip and we know that the climber is applying sufficient pressure because he needs as a as a pinch the climber must pull on the hold away from the wall. So he needs to engage on bringing the elbow out Here the climber needs to continually apply pressure onto the left grip. He does this by creating friction between the skin of the fingers and the holds pores. So engaging on creating pressure is by the climber sending the elbow down with force in order to apply that pressure if he's not able to lean underneath the hold. As we can see the climber has made the right hand onto the last hold. This one being a positive grip because we can see how the climber is able to wrap the hand with the fingers curled behind the edge of the hold being a small jug. Makes it easy for the climber then to pull. So right now his elbow is pointing away from the wall and he's at a wide pull up. As the climber was pushing down on the foot that helps him gain height we can see how the climber's toe has gone inside the hold. This would make the foot even more secured for its place. And the left the right leg is continuing to be extended. And as we can see it helps the climber with his stability when making the motions. And we can see how the leg extended helped the climber to also by bringing the leg in underneath the left foot being in place it helps the climber with making a twist of his body going to the right side which supports the climber bringing his center of gravity close to the wall and also helping with the reach going out right. The climber was able to secure the grip above and pinches it as we can see he places the thumb underneath the hold. Once he has secured the grip and pressure then the climber is able to lean on the hold which allows him to release some pressure down at the feet to bring the left foot at height to come and match at the lip where his left hand is placed. Here the climber had performed a very dynamic move, very similar to a dyno except that the areas of support are still connected to the wall. So he had initially lowered himself center of gravity by keeping the arms extended and had placed the right foot. Then he had lowered himself and when ready to commit for the move, he pulled himself as close as he could bringing the chest forward towards the wall at the same time pushing down at the right foot and quickly engaging the left leg that has been extended to tap it against the wall. This way the climber is able to keep position as soon as he locks the move, bringing meaning gain height, then he was able to send the hand to secure the grip. The climber has sent the left hand up to the purple block. This, he applies it with the hand open and places the fingers on the flat surface area of the block. This, the climber then bends the hand to make a close grip with the knuckles and sends the thumb on the other side of the block. As the climber making the move up to the hold, he first originally had come from the undercling. And once he had set the right foot onto the wall, keeping a high stance, then he was able to release the left hand from the undercling to come into a match at the right hand and quickly moved, being on the same stance, to send the hand up to the next move, being the purple block. When the climber just comes from making the placement on the move and quickly moves to the next one, that is called bumping. The climber takes advantage of this momentum and brings the left hand to the grip above, matching on the same lip. This one was smart of the climber to let go of that sloper as he would not be able to sustain the grip. As the climber continues to swing out, he now has to hold onto the grip tight and eventually pull himself in and engage the core so that he is able to raise the feet to make a foot placement. Here the climber is shucking up his hands. This will help the climber to absorb any sweat that may be coming from his hands as well as having a better grip when sustaining on the holds. the climber was able to stick the grip and this one because it's rounded the climber gives it extra grip by curling the fingers onto the hold to have extra friction to secure the grip and the climber then applies weight by bending the elbow so that he's able to pull on the hold now the climber is aiming right now to what the next grip is The climber makes a quick adjustment of the hand on the hold. This one because he is using the sides of the block and needs to release pressure one hand at a time to make the adjustments. So the climber first adjusts the left hand and sends the fingertips to come and meet the top of the hold. The climber brings the wrist into the hold to apply pressure. And at the same time he sends the thumb above the hold. This helps the climber to have a closer grip which is a more controlled way of holding the hold as he's able to keep the elbow close to the wall with this position. As we can see the climber is now able to engage onto a pull up with the left hand and while pressing down on the heel he then is able to release some pressure at the right hand to have it repositioned and places the hand the fingers flat at the top and engaging the bottom ball of the palm in order to create pressure. Now the climber is creating pressure by squeezing the hold with the palms side to side which helps the climber to engage into a close pull up that helps him to gain height to bring his center of gravity closer to him which is an easier way for him to make a pull up rather than using the pinches. Now the climber once he finds a comfortable way of having to squeeze the hold and secures the grip then the climber will be able to lower his his body so that he can apply pressure onto the right hand and whenever the climber is ready to be engaged again, he can trust the grips that he has to go back into a pull up to move the left hand out for the next move. As the climber glances over at the wall to aim for the next move, we can see how the climber had brought his left toe to come into match. Match means when the climber has more than one limb on the same hold. He brought the left toe to come into place and apply pressure before releasing the right foot from its place. Here the climber had to let the swing be decreased and continue to hold on tight to the grips. Reason he wasn't able to make the first placement of his feet onto the wall and on the second swing the climber was able to bring his left foot into a higher stance. The climber initially when he went up for the jump to go on to the purple lip of the hold he had released the heel hook and heel hooks provided a lot of power because brings the center of gravity of the climber close to the wall and when they are released they can push away the climber away from the wall. This one because the climber needs and if he was going to release the heel hook it needs to be in control and in this case because it was dynamic it was out of control so the climber was making a very committed move. As we can see, the climber is placing the feet onto the wall. And when both of the feet are placed on the wall and is no longer in the mat, then the climb will start. Because the climber is able to secure the right grip, he was able to extend the arm and is performing a layback. This one because the left foot is still being on that edge, it's easier for him to lay back so he can make an easy transition of the left hand coming to match at the last hold. Now the climber sustains the hold for 3 seconds, then the climb has been completed. Here, the climber is blowing on his hands and this is to get rid of any excess chalk that the climber may have.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As we can see when the climber was engaging into a forceful pull up to make the move out left, the right leg is continued to be extended. The right foot is not an actual hold, but is pressing against the wall. This will help the climber to when he makes the pull up, to go for the direction out for the throw. Because the climber will be pressing down on the lower foot as he continues to keep his left foot over the hold. The climber is shaking his hands. This will help the climber to release any tension that may be built up, especially if he had already attempted climbing the wall before. Also, shaking them helps tendons to get loosened up and warming the hands up. Here the climber has dropped the weight after making a small movement at the feet, potentially also because the hands weren't wrapped deeply into the hold. So this compromised the climber from sustaining the holds by creating friction and also the climber having power grip to sustain the hold. If the climber drops the weight, this will add extra energy for the climber to engage and the reason why the climber has slipped off from the wall. It's important that the climber glances over at the feet. He does a hop to release the left foot to let the right foot take place. The left foot being placed was from the bottom side of the shoe and the outer edge, which is not the most ideal when he got himself first into position since for climbing it's ideal to press down on the toe box area, which is where the right foot is going to take place over the hold. Here the climber is starting at a one hold start, meaning that both hands will be placed in the same hold. And the type of hold that the climber is holding onto is flat at the top. So the climber in order to place pressure will have to bring the elbows to stay lower right under the hold. Once the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall and presses the feet and the climber comes into position by raising the hips off the mat then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Bring in over the toe to come into place over the lip of the hold. Now the climber needs to continue to apply pressure onto the right toe at this moment and once the climber gets to create pressure onto the left toe coming into place and the climber will be able to release the right foot. the climber after making the right hand placement she has pulled herself in once more to perform another move at reach. When the climber has done two consecutive moves the second move is considered bumping when she's sustaining onto the same areas of support. In this case the climber was able to up for the second hold and this one being a very positive grip the climber is able to trust the landing of the hand bringing it over the horn. The climber is performing a very committed move where transfers over the weight to the right foot being in place so she at the moment of his standing releases the heel hook and has pulled hard onto the grips. This the left hand being in place will help the climber to bring her chest close to the wall while continuing to press onto the right toes for the climber to gain height. Now it's all a matter of time and power for the climber bringing the right hand to come into place. It was smart of the climber to bump over the move as the hold down lower was more of an open grip, being really hard to sustain. The climber's next hold that she bumped onto is a jug as the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold. Now the climber is glancing down at the feet to perform a new foot placement and she's sending the left heel to come into the wall and placing the outer area of the heel towards the hold. Now when both limbs are into the same hold, this is called matching. The climber brings the right hand to come into a match at the handle, but this time placing it as an undercling as she places the palm from underneath the hold. Being a handle, the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the hold. The climber, as she has sustained into the grips in front of her, she's able to lean back to transfer over the weight to the grips. And blindly has moved the left foot to a high foot placement. The climber continues to adjust the left hand grip. This one because the surface is thick and the climber is not able to close the grip so she brings the hand to be placed as far in as she can to create a hook with the hand of the skin meeting the hold in order to create friction. Now for the climber to bring the left hand at distance, she had stepped off on the left foot to bring over her center of gravity to the left side when performing the move. At this moment the climber was trying to gain a civility on remaining her center of gravity between the grips and The way that the climber had placed the heel onto high foot placement coming over to a match That foot placement is called a heel hook and heel hooks are known to be really strong When being applied this because the climber will be able to use it almost as a third hand and bring her center of gravity close to the wall Especially when releasing the right foot because then she will be loading the heel hook with her weight Now the climber is glancing down the right foot to make a new high foot placement The climber while sustaining the main areas of support she has kept the left leg extended as a flagging out. This is to transfer over the weight to the right foot as long as keeping balance over the moves. As we can see the climber has gone once more for another consecutive move. This is called bumping. Because of the dynamic move, the climber is swinging and she must stabilize herself which is why the climber has sent the left hand over to the grip to secure it. As we can see, the left leg was continuing to be extended throughout the move. This is called flagging out so the climber was able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place and now the climber is sustaining with both hands over the last hold. She must demonstrate control and stability over the match as well as the body position in order to complete the climb. The climber after performing the foot switch which is an accurate foot placement, she has extended the left leg. This is called flagging out and helps the climber to keep balance over her areas of support. Now as the climber has brought the right foot into place, we can see how the knee is placed to come inwards and keeps the right side of the body close to the wall, which makes it easy for the climber to transition the right hand out of the match to the next hold. Now as we can see, the climber's next hold is flat at the top and possibly slightly incut, so the climber is able to place the fingers on top of the hold. In order to create pressure, the climber must try to close the grip by bringing the palm in, since this is a slightly open grip. The climber needed to stabilize the swing so quickly brings her arms to be engaged in a pull-up to bring the right foot over to a match. Now it's important that the climber glances down at the feet especially when performing a new foot placement or foot switch. So right now the climber is performing a foot switch technique in which she is bringing the outer area of the toe to come into place with the hold and create pressure onto that one side of the toe coming in contact with the hold. Once a climber gets to release the left foot the climber then rolls the toe over the lip of the hold. As the climber has brought the right foot to come into place, now her main areas of support is her left hand and her right foot being in place. This one because the climber before sending the hand out for reach, she has released the left foot. This one, the climber does it for extending the leg to help her gain balance over the move when sending the right hand for the reach. As we can see the climber's right foot being applied onto the wall, she has brought the knee to come inwards and it helps the climber to keep her right side towards the wall when performing the reach. The climber in transferring the load to the left foot coming into place, the right toe has slipped off. This one because the climber was slowly losing pressure due to the climber bringing the left foot at height. Now because the climber is going out for a swing, she must sustain onto the left hand grip to continue to apply force for the toe coming into place. The climber is starting at a one hold start where she places both of the hands with the palms facing up towards the lip of the hold. Now the climber is sustaining to a grip that is above her and placing the palms towards the lip of the hold. This is called an undercling and in order for the climber to sustain the grip she's using the thumbs to create pressure by closing the grip and pinching the lip of the hold. Now as we can see the climber is keeping the arms extended. This is called a rest position and it allows her to transfer the weight to the grips. Now the climber had started at a step up start so the climber had first placed the right foot onto place and then brings the left foot onto the wall. When the climber is no longer on the mat then the climb will start. The climber was able to land the right hand open-handed over the lip of the hold. This one being a jug, the climber can wrap the fingers behind the lip and in securing the grip the climber then drops the weight. Another thing about heel hooks is the climber first when she had it placed almost at shoulder height, the knee was out and as the climber has been gaining height, the climber then has brought the knee to come inwards to apply more pressure onto the heel being in place to push down. Now heel hooks are really strong foot placements and in this instance the climber is onto a wide stance keeping the arms extended to transfer over the weight to the grips. At this moment the climber has lowered her center of gravity and is staring at a hold at reach where the climber will perform dynamic move. The dynamic move the climber will have to bring her center of gravity as low as she can and engage forcefully into pressing down at the feet in order to send the hand over for the reach. The climber had sent the right hand over to the next hold at reach. However, it has retracted it and brought it back into a match, this time only placed above the hold. This one is a thick hold being a slope so the climber is applying friction by placing the fingertips as far in into the handle to sustain the grip. Now that the climber was able to trust the grip, she is leaning back and had glanced over at the right foot to bring it over to a high foot position to prepare her again to perform the next move. The climber in continuing to apply pressure onto the left foot, she was able to rotate the toe to come inwards so it's facing the top of area of the lip of the hold to this time be pushed away and the climber quickly transfers the left hand over to a match where the right hand is. The left toe pushing the hold helps the climber to bring the center of gravity underneath the grips. The climber is sustaining to a large hold for the left hand. This one being open handed, the climber must continue to apply friction onto the grip, reason why the climber had placed it far in. As the climber dropped the weight onto the left hand grip, it is important that the climber continues to apply pressure at the feet, reason why the climber glances down at the feet and releases the left hand that was placed as an undercling. Undercling hand placements are really strong because it can be held as low as the waist when gaining height. In order to bring it to a pull, the climber needed to bring the elbow close to the core. Now the climber entrusting the left hand grip, she releases the right hand and must continue to apply pressure at the feet. The climber had intentionally detached the right foot after placing the left hand to come into a match. Now when the feet are out of the wall and she's swinging out, this is called cutting feet. But the climber is engaging both of the grips right now to sustain the last hold to demonstrate that she has control over sustaining the grips. The climber then has engaged in a forceful pull up to bring her chest close to the wall as she stands up onto the right foot being placed the highest. That's when the climber had gained height to send the left hand grip over to the next hold. Now the left hand is placed over a thick handle where the climber gets to place the grip and wraps it around the top area of the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You see that she whips her head around and then gets back around to the front nice and clean without any issues. So here again, just in the forward and back, her feet are really flat on the floor. So trying to go up on her toes, that will just kind of help to elevate the energy a little bit more and just keeping her light in the movement. So the dancer starts stepping in place. She is just doing the triple step. She should definitely try to move up on her toes a little bit, try to get those knees bent and when she gets to the third step, try to keep her at least upper body moving so that way it's not such a big pause in her steps. All right, here she did a good job with the tacks in front, and she was shaking her shoulders a bit more. So nice job there. So here again, I think this foot, the left leg, it should only be the toe on the floor, and really try to push your hips and sway them out, so that way you have this constant like movement of flow in your body.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

However, her shoulder is opening up here, so her arm that is higher up is swinging too far backwards behind her head, behind her neck, and behind her body. So instead of swinging backwards like that, she should press her shoulder forward towards the screen. Therefore, her arm would be going sideways instead of backwards. The dancer is filling in time here until she's ready to complete her next movement or start her next movement. And each movement that she does should be just as exciting. So even if she's backing up and waiting for some type of musical cue before she proceeds to the next step, we shouldn't as an audience be able to tell that. So every movement that she does, whether it's the first movement that she's doing or the last movement that she's doing before the next series of steps, should be filled with just as much energy and just as much purpose and not a filler movement or a waiting movement. Otherwise, we also know what she's about to do. Much better here when she did those clap steps backwards. She did it a number of times again, and her last iteration of doing it was still in rhythm the same way as her first iteration of doing it. This is not how she did it earlier in the video, but here, this is great. In going back to three here when she is moving her entire body backing this clapping series of Kick and steps backwards She is doing a wonderful job and staying on rhythm for the first three times that she does it the fourth time She loses her rhythm and the clap that she does with her hands It's not on the same count as how she did it the past three iterations So in repeating the steps She has to make sure she's always staying on the same rhythm and not losing it the last time she's doing it before anticipating her next step That's perhaps probably why she lost her rhythm in that she's thinking about what is the next step coming next instead of staying in? The moment on that exact step that she's executing She's swinging her arms right to left, but she needs a little bit of clarity and consistency in her level of her arms. For the most part, they're okay, but in this last iteration, she swung her arm too high so that her hand here was higher than her head. And that also is an easy way to raise your shoulders up, which we don't want. So she should be keeping her arms at a height that is not above her neck or above her head. Here they swung up a little too far. Her arms here are great in that they're in a straight line, but her wrist, however, can use some type of direction, whether she wants to flex her hands with her fingers pointing outward or to have her wrist just straight and her fingers pointing outward instead of upward. But here they're in this in-between area, so she needs to put focus on her wrist to match the clarity that she has in her arms. The dancer just did a box step or a jazz square. It's called a jazz square because each point is supposed to be equidistant, the same, or sorry, each corner should be equidistant the same way as a square is. Her rhythm was perfect and going cross and back and back. However, her movements weren't all equidistant or the shape she made wouldn't really have been a square. It would have been some other type of quadrilateral that didn't have exact points at each corner of the square. So to improve this step, she could keep in the same rhythm that she had, which was perfect, but instead making sure that each step is the same distance as each other so that her tracing of her feet would be in a square and not some other four pointed shape. Her arms here have great energy in that they're pointing downward. She's straining her arms when she's doing it. She's pushing her full energy downward and that is great. She's not halfway doing that step, she's doing that step fully. Her knees are swiveling, pointing to the right side and the left side. This is great mobility. This is great range of motion. And she's really able to move her knees like that because her feet are also swiveling and her hips are also swiveling. So she's able to move her lower body from her hips downward, right and left swiveling in that direction because all of those joints, her hips, her knees, and her feet are all going right and left. Otherwise, it would really be hard for her to move her knees isolated without also moving her hips and her knee, I'm sorry, her hips and her toes. So this is really good coordination of her lower body using all three joints that swivel right and left. She's executing these toe heels well. We can tell exactly when she's on her toe or when she's on her heel. She can improve this movement even further in the extent in which she's on her toe. So right now, she's kind of on an angle. But if she can get her toe or be on her tippy toes as much as possible so that her heel is pointing upward instead of on that back diagonal, it would make this step even clearer and show a further difference between when she is on her toe or when she is on her heel. The dancer is continuously extending her leg out in the same spatial arrangement or to the same degree. So that is great. She is consistent in how far she is extending her leg with each step. When she's transitioning from the smooth movement that she swung her arms to the kind of sharp movement when she turned her body, it seems like she's catching herself by surprise. So she doesn't want to start that movement before the beat, but she needs to know that she's about to change her weight or shift her weight. So she can improve this movement or improve this transition of this movement by centering herself in her abdominal muscles. So that would help her be grounded before she turns her body so that she's able to do it swiftly and without as much difficulty as she had here. She has great focus here. Her eyes are looking in the direction that she's going. So her eyes are focusing on her hands, so her whole body is turned towards the direction that her hands are going. That is great focus, whether she's going right or she's going left, her head and her arms are doing the same thing. She knows what she is doing in terms of choreography, but in doing so she's anticipating her next step. So when she just swung her arms right and left, she did not finish the step over here when she swung her arms to her right or left of the screen. So she only did that movement halfway before beginning this next step where she's coming forward. She needs to complete her movements completely before she is coming forward or moving on to the next step in general. She starts these out, ends getting very low. I would say her feet and her knees are kind of in this perpendicular angle, that's great. But as she proceeds to continue this step, her body doesn't get as low. It started very low, but it's getting less and less low throughout. So she needs to keep this consistency when she was all the way down, when her legs were open further wide, which was helping her get down, those work in tandem, her getting lower and her legs being wider. She's definitely capable of it. She did it the first time. She just has to continue that throughout. When she jumps, she can change her level here. So her waist should be going downward. Her waist should be pointing downward. She is not able to do that here because her legs are too close together. But if she was to jump and move her legs further apart, that would leave more room for her waist to go downward. And therefore she would be able to bend her knees and her whole body would be going further downward. Her arms, however, are inconsistent. So her legs are going consistently, same direction, same amount of space that they're taking up, but her arms seem to be more improvised and have less of an exact space where she's aiming for. So the dancer could use some more clarity on arm location to match the clarity she has in her leg location. Sometimes her arm is outward to a degree, sometimes it's a little higher, sometimes she's flicking her hand. So she could just use some clarity in determining where she would like her arms to be and how.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

As he transfers his cut vegetables to the bowl, you can see that he holds his cutting board in the air and slowly scrapes the vegetables down into the bowl with his paring knife. This is an excellent way to transfer the vegetables efficiently and quickly. As you can see here, he kind of struggles to peel the skin off of this very short one and a half inch round. That's why I would recommend that he cut in half lengthwise on the longer piece if he was going to only choose to use half of it. He also has selected to use a paring knife and a vegetable peeler. For his seasoning, it appears that he is using freshly ground black pepper, which I think is a great complement to this salad. He gathers a small mixing bowl with which to toss his vegetable salad and I do like the fact that he rinses it out beforehand. You always want to have a clean serving piece, especially in an application where all of the vegetables are raw before you're going to add anything to the dish. To begin chopping the tomato, he cuts off the root end and then cuts the tomato half in crosswise slashes as well. The first step in making his cucumber and tomato salad is gathering all of the ingredients that he will need. So he grabs a half of a cucumber and a cut tomato, it looks like both of which have already been used for a previous recipe. Those are stored in the fridge, which they should be. His last step is tossing the salad so that it all of the salad ingredients are evenly coated with the oil and the black pepper. However, he has skipped two key ingredients in this recipe which is an acid and salt. Salt is necessary for rounding out the flavor of the salad and acid is a necessary component as well. You could use lemon, lime, any type of vinegar, but those two items are missing in this recipe. After the cucumber is peeled, he cuts the round into three slices and then proceeds to dice those three slices. He's cutting it adequately, but it's not a very chef-driven method or technique to his cuts. He cuts off a one, it looks like a one and a half inch round from the cucumber half and peels the skin off of that cucumber. I would actually recommend if he was only going to use partial of the cucumber to cut it in half lengthwise. Step two is gathering all of the tools and equipment he will need. Here he has a very clean wood cutting board that he's going to chop the vegetables on. This this wooden cutting board looks really really clean. I typically recommend when making a raw salad to use a plastic cutting board. It just is easier to clean. It doesn't hold as much bacteria or smells.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She's turning completely to her left side for this first pose and then turning completely to the right side on the second pose. This is a cool little like freestyle moment where I think your hands could probably go anywhere, but she chooses on her head and then to her waist. But just really nice changing of directions and staying with the music. So this next part, she does two turns around. She'll step salsa front and turn, drawing her arms up over her head and around. And I really like how she uses the arms. During this part, she takes her right arm and brushes across her left arm that's out. And just adds a little extra feel to her arms so it's not just her arms drawing up as she turns and brings them down, she adds a little more personal style to it. So in the beginning, the dancer is stepping side to side, and she's swinging her arms up in almost like a half-moon position to her right and her left. She's also kind of accenting the beat, and she does a little pop with her chest and her arms. So it's not just her swinging side to side, but she's one and two and, just to give it a little extra. So that's really nice. So even though she messed up a lot in this one, I think she had some really strong moments when she was doing the choreography. It was correct, just the transitions and doing the things full out until she's done with that phrase to move into the next one. So even if you mess up, this is a good way to just improvise and keep doing the same step until you're ready to move on to the next or because this is salsa, just going back and forth with the either front and back salsa step or side to side salsa step so you continue moving. So here she's doing the step touches where her arms are drawing up and forward. Again, I think she forgot what was coming next, but if she would have just stayed in the moment and kind of continued doing that step until she was ready to move on to the next one, it just would have been a lot cleaner transition into the next step. So this next step, she starts to, I think, forget what she's supposed to do. But if she would have just kept going and stayed in the music, it would have been fine. She's stepping to her left and her right on the 1, 2, 3 beat. And she's drawing her arm around her chest and in front. She has really nice arm usage for this part. It's drawing the attention to the eye. And if she would have just kept on going and stayed on it, I think she would have got back on the music. It wouldn't have stopped.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Perhaps just some additional rehearsal here would be beneficial, but they do appear to forget the choreography, which is thus throwing them off the rhythm quite significantly. As the dancer performs this twisting of their feet where they're bringing their heels all the way out to the side to their left-hand side And then twisting them back towards their right. They would really benefit from performing this movement more fully even though it's quick They're really kind of almost barely performing the movement with their feet. Though they have a nice bend in their knees It would benefit from dropping the pelvis back so that they're more grounded which would help them to perform this twist a bit more quickly And efficiently. They would also benefit from finding some clarity in the incorporation of their arms in this movement As the dancer performs this ball change with their feet that locomotes them slightly from side to side in the space, they have a lot of nice clarity in their footwork. However, they would benefit from bending their knees more deeply and dropping their pelvis back to be more grounded, which would then activate a greater range of motion in their pelvis, which would help them to connect more deeply to the rhythm. As the dancer begins with a stationary basic step touch where they're reaching one foot out to the side, meeting it back in the middle, and then alternating sides, they've got a nice deep bend in their knees as well as some nice clarity in their footwork and incorporation of their arms. However, while they're incorporating their movement up through their body, they have a lot of extraneous movement happening from their pelvis up through their torso, which while it feels appropriate in this moment, I worry will keep them from being able to transition quickly into the next movement, especially as the tempo begins to pick up. The dancer appears to struggle through this transitional moment. They're struggling to find clarity in the shaping of their body. They're hesitant to connect to the rhythm. And lost all that nice kind of bend in their knees that they had prior, which is helping to ground them in their movement. Overall, some additional rehearsal would be needed to kind of find some clarity and some refinement here. As the dancer performs this body roll, they have a fair amount of motion happening through their head and their torso. However, they would benefit from finding a deeper articulation all the way from the top of the head through the shoulders, the spine, and through the pelvis, which would help them to perform the body roll a bit more fully while staying more deeply connected to the rhythm. As the dancer transitions into a salsa step that locomotes them forwards and backwards in the space, they have a lot of nice clarity in their footwork as well as incorporation of their arms.

You can see that he's untwisted his right knee and he's now just standing on it. He's fully extended on it. This left leg is kind of just keeping tension, keeping himself in. And it's kind of providing a little bit of support up too. But overall it looks really good. A lot of tension here, a lot of power. Kind of blends that line of like, you know, going static knee womp. But here it's like this move is so big that it's going to be hard for him to pull this hold all the way down kind of towards his belly button. So some sort of a momentum and dynamic movement is going to be needed here. He executes it just perfectly. Kind of pulling with his arms while he simultaneously pushes with his feet. You know, springing with the right foot first and then kind of keeping tension with the left foot. So overall it looks really good. Yeah, we can see he was able to really drive all the way up to his right hand and really pull down He kind of used that arm. He used that right foot as kind of an extra arm And really pull with his lower body instead of just having to push and toe down So that looks really good. Now you can see he's kind of getting opposite pose again Swapping his left foot to his right foot. I'm swapping his right foot Well swap that right foot to a left foot So he'll be able to be opposite pose and kind of twist that left Left hip into the wall kind of bounce out and pivot around this right arm and move upwards So here we can see he's gonna be going he's got this hold and the finish hold And he's kind of doing this weird drop knee and it's it's not really working because this this foot is further left in his body And he's moving that direction So ideally what happened is this knee would kind of rotate out And get pushed over he would push his knee out and kind of stand up on that foot and just shift his whole body this way By dropping the knee by dropping the knee in He's applying this pressure down at this angle, so that's actually gonna send him kind of more this way And so it's kind of now can be starting to work against him instead of working for him You know, he does cut the feet here. He is on a really good big hold But that is gonna take you know, he's he's he's locked off He's having to hold the swing. He's gonna have to bring his feet back in so all these like little movements are if he's Are gonna attack some slightly so matter what towards the end. He's gonna have to try a little harder He's not gonna be as fresh. So ideally what we'd want to see is him just work his feet up all the way up So he's in a position When he gets his foot back in so ideally there'd be a static way to just walk the field and having to cut the feet So overall, it starts from a good position, arms are pretty straight. I think the one thing to see is moving up and to the left. What I would adjust is having this left knee on the outside of the arm, so that way it can kind of drive up and over instead of getting trapped by the arm. That would just let that left leg be more open to more movement, and just kind of being on top of that foothold. Again, you know he's keeping that right arm nice and straight this left arm is bent and cold tension But he you know once he makes that big right hand move he immediately kind of gets into the next position So that means walking his feet up and over He's right hand on so he walks his feet up and over it gets his left foot on so nice opposite opposed Now he's kind of getting this kind of position where it's these kind of scrunched, these hands match on this thing. You notice his right knee is kind of dropping down and that's going to kind of let him drive that right hip into the wall so he can kind of spring up and out to go up to these holds over here. And if he does this kind of in coordination or if he's able to kind of spring out and kind of spring that right foot to get him height, he can then push off this left foot to kind of get him pushed all the way over into this area over to the right and make that big dead point move. Kind of interesting, right off the bat, he's kind of getting scrunched up. He's going to do this heel, matching his right heel to his right hand. If he does that good, he's got a good bottom left foot, so he should be able to get a lot of drive up and over this. With this heel, it's going to get better and better. As he gets above it, he's going to be able to go from pulling down to pushing down, and should be able to get a lot of height off of it.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The dancer is picking up his knee very high here. He doesn't need to pick up his knee so high Instead the dancer could focus on crossing his foot a little bit more on a diagonal in Front of him so that the movement is more on a diagonal across that it is basically an up and down movement It looks as more so as if he's marching instead of crossing his feet on what should be a more gradual diagonal The dancer is marching with flat feet when he steps. It would be better if he pressed his weight onto his toes so that his movement would be lighter and not so heavy. The dancer's turns aren't as neat as they can be because he is turning flat-footed on his heels. Sorry, flat-footed with his heels on the ground, which is also going to cause friction and make the turn less sleek, especially in sneakers, so he can make his turns more fluid by putting his weight onto his toes. The dancer is stepping with his foot turned in. His foot is turned towards the corner of the room when he's about to turn, but instead his toe should be facing directly forward. His body as well should be facing forward before he turns. And part of the reason why his toe is turned and his torso is turned because he's already looking towards the corner of the room when he should start this turn using his focus onto the curtain straight in front of him. His arms have good movement here and that they're bouncing up and down while he's touching or tapping his toe out. So his arms here have good energy. The dancer has good energy in his shoulders. He's bringing his shoulders alternately, one up and one down. As a result, his arms are also moving one up and one down. The dancer continues to look down. He really needs to use his focus to look outward because it changes the shape of his spine. But also since he is soon to be completing a series of turns and revolutions in this space, looking down is on his best interest because it's easier for him to get dizzy and lose balance on the turns. The dancer is also looking downward here. We see that he sees the floor. It is a egocentric view. It's also changing the shape of his spine because his head is tilted forward and then his spine ultimately becomes a bit crunched instead of pulling up with a lot of energy. I wish the dancer also engaged his hips while doing this movement because again he has good movement in his Torso, but he could use that movement in his waist as well Alternating his hips right and left as he's stepping in the space", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

If we hit this right corner of the square it will go in the basket every single time He just slightly put it too far to the left because of the placement on the backboard from where he released it and the angle he released it we end up missing the layup. If we look at the placement of this shot, he hits the ball inside of the square, but on the top line of the square. So as it's near the top right corner of the square, that's the area we're looking to aim for. He places the ball nicely there, and it goes, and he places the ball nicely in the top right corner, which is the spot we're looking to hit on the layup, and it goes nicely into the basket. Here he shows the proper footwork and jumping technique when you're jumping off of one foot for a right hand reverse layup. Here you see he jumps off of his left foot, which is the correct foot when we want to jump, when we want to do a right hand reverse layup. We want to make sure we jump off this left foot. Also he does a good job of lifting up his right knee as he jumps, getting that right knee up to his hip level. By us getting that knee up to the level of our hip, this allows us to explode up higher into the air as we jump and it gives us the thrust to reach the maximum point of our jump in the air. This allows us to reach the apex of our jump as we go into the air. on this attempt is he places it inside the square and on the top portion of the square however it hits the backboard closer to the middle section of the square so from the angle where he released the ball the momentum is carrying the ball and now is going to hit the left side of the rim on this shot attempt it was able to stay just barely inside the rim and go into the basket but we have to be careful not to place the ball too much to the middle or towards the left side of the square from the right side of the basket otherwise we run the risk of missing the shot long on the left side As he releases the ball, he does a good job of releasing the ball high and away from his frame, thereby releasing the ball at the highest possible point of his jump. As you can see, his arm is extended out, which is a good position to make sure the ball is extended and away from the defense, and then we release the ball at the highest possible point. He also does a good job of holding up that left arm to protect the shot as he releases the layup. Having this arm here protects the ball from the defense who is on his inside left shoulder and they're attempting to contest or block the shot. That left arm will slow the defense down just long enough to allow him to release the ball out of his right hand and onto the basket before the defense has the opportunity to block or contest their shot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Keeping the arms extended helps the climber not engage the upper body for when he would need to use it moving out of the stance. Here we can see the climber has swapped his feet by placing the right toe onto a foot chip and brings the right leg with the knee pointing inwards. This is so that the climber has an easier time transferring the right hand over to the left side by keeping the right side of the body towards the wall to help with the reach on the right hand. Now the left leg being extended, this is called flagging out. The climber does this so that he can support and balance most force to drive it onto the foot that's being placed, being the right foot. Now we can see that leg extended, this is called flagging out, and also aids the climber to keep the right side towards the wall by pressing down on the toe, touching the wall to help with twist. Here it's unsure as what the climbers next move would be and it's important to know where the hands and feet placement need to be for the climber to engage on releasing the hand whether it's going left or right, the hand placement is important and it needs to be accurate so that the climber doesn't get tired out or doesn't get to hurt themselves in this case creating so much pressure on one of the grips. Here the climber is chucking up his hands and this will help the climber to gain a better grip on the holds. Also this will help the climber to absorb any sweat that may be coming from his hands. Here, the right hand being placed on top of the left hand is actually creating a lot of pressure for the left hand. So something that the climber is doing is trying to find position on the feet, but is unable to achieve the position on the feet, potentially because of the pressure that is bothering the climber at this time due to the hand positioning. Here the climber seems to struggle to get the hands positioned onto the same hold. This is a very shallow hold and also a small donut. So it means that the climber is trying to really get both hands onto the same hold. When both hands are in the same hold, that's called matching. And also the type of movement that the climber is doing is placing one hand over the other. Here we can see the climber getting positioned into two hold start. Now, this means that each hand is going to be in its own hold and both of the holds are donuts, meaning that the climber is able to pinch and grip on it. So, not only he is pinching it, but also can lay forcefully by relying on the top fingers of each hand hold while keeping arms extended. Now, the climb will start until the climber gets to place the feet on the wall and the body is off the ground.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

But then again, not trying to do the dyno this time again. So then this time he attempts to match the left hand hold, which looks a little bit harder because it's kind of a straight pull down so he's not able to undercling. So this is where I think, you know, starting right hand here, left hand here, and just starting with your arms crossed would be kind of the way to go because it's going to be a pretty hard hold to match on the left side.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They started to swing a little, took their right foot off and then put it back on. They might have been trying to do a classic dyno move where you pogo the right foot, plant it and then jump. That creates a considerable amount of swing, but it often doesn't work on an overhung wall like this without a big protruding volume. And so this is definitely keeping both feet on the wall and jumping out of that position. And gaining the momentum from your hips instead of a pogo. The climber then jumps for the hold and just comes up short. They just did not carry enough momentum and they jumped a little late, so they tried to get over the foot first and then jump, whereas that should probably just be one linear movement, and as a result they come up short.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You can see his right leg is kind of twisted and bent. And then when he kind of moves his foot over, he has weight up to this foot, his hips kind of pull back. So there's just going to be more force he's got to pull himself into the wall with. Now he's kind of having trouble keeping balance because he's right hand on, right foot on. You can see that his whole kind of left side is trying to kind of open up as he tries to kind of readjust on this hold and kind of move up. So he's kind of rushing this next part. He hasn't really gotten his lower body into the right position. I think in the previous attempt he put a heel hook out right. So doing something to kind of balance out either swapping the foot back and that's where it kind of earlier if he kind of stuck to the left foot on back flagging the right. He would have saved him having to foot swap back to that and he would already be in the kind of position to move up and left off this right hand. But now kind of when he hits this pinch, he's low and he's kind of having to kind of dynamically go to it. So he catches it, he's kind of pretty far back from the wall. And it seems like his weight is kind of easily thrown around because he's maybe not holding as much tension. And so overall, off to a good start, his arms are pretty straight. He's not really fighting the position, both arms, even though they're kind of in different orientations at different positions, the arms look really good. Really driving through these feet. So overall, very good start in position, showing some good tension and not fighting the position and really kind of sinking into the start and finding that good kind of equilibrium starting point where he's not too engaged on the hands, too engaged on the feet. Seems like he's kind of keeping equal tension all over. So here we can see he starts to kind of do the twist lock. He's got the left foot flagged out. He's side stepping on the right foot and now what he needs to do is stand up on that right foot and then kind of turn his torso, his chest into that arm and bicep and really twist and kind of kind of get that whole right side of his body straight into the wall so that way he can kind of step up through that foot and get the height that he needs. So in this case me the instance would be is uh Kind of getting this knee and before he cuts his feet kind of trying to get that knee over this foot hold So he's applying the all the force directly straight down and that should bring us hips closer into the wall But also more up and left so that way when he goes for this next move His lower body is already kind of closer to that position. You can keep a little more rigid I think what happened here is this foot was just a little too far below And now his hips and stuff everything's so far to the right so that way when he did let go He's having to tuck it so it doesn't kind of pull away too far and scrape the pads So here we can see he does this hand foot match. So I like what he's doing here It's like the previous attempt He kept his left foot low got right foot and then match up here By matching his bottom foot and bringing the left foot up immediately It's gonna keep him a little bit more in control and just keep him overall get a little more balance and control Kind of less foot swaps and we does do the foot swaps. He's in a kind of better position. I scrunched So I do like the improvement there", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This will allow the climber coming over in front of him to apply the left foot to come into a high foot placement. Now the climber was able to place that left hand and immediately moves the right hand over to a larger hold. This one is a slightly sloped so the climber must bring the hand as far in to be placed with the palm towards the hold so that he is able to press the hold with the fingers. Now the climber was figuring out and shifting the weight and now he is able to bring his center of gravity underneath the grips. Because of the right hand being sloped, the climber needs to continue to apply surface to the hold to give it friction. Now it is important that the climber continues to stay underneath the hold placement, especially for the right hand. Bringing the elbow close to the wall will help the climber sustain the grip. Because the climbers hold is a distance over to the right side, the climber right now is adjusting on pivoting over the right foot that he just placed. This will potentially bring the left knee to come over to the left side being outwards to get his center of gravity close to the wall. However, the grips are at his chest height which will make it difficult for him to sustain even if sustaining two good holds. The climber is glancing over to the next move at reach. This one seems to have concave areas side to side and potential being able to pinch onto the hold once committing to it. As we can see the climber brought the right foot to come into place and keeps the left arm extended to transfer over the weight to the highest grip. Now that the climber had placed the foot he's able to keep himself close to the wall by pulling onto the right hand grip and whenever he's ready he will lower then he center of gravity and push hard onto the left toe that is placed against the wall. He will then press against the wall as imagining at a foothold on a smear and he will then get lowered and push by extending the leg to send himself over at the direction at reach to release the right hand to make the hand placement. Once that climber pushes the left foot his left leg will be extended going out on a flag to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place and the leg being extended will help him keep in balance over the move. The climber chose to keep the right foot dropped, being on the flag, to make one move ahead, this one coming onto a pinch grip where the climber, instead of using the thumb to one side of the hold, he uses the ball of the palm to press into it with the fingers. Once the climber gets the squeeze onto the hold and secured the grip in the climber, the climber glances down at the right foot to bring it over to place in the one that he had planned out to. The climber has made a couple moves from the start till now with the right leg extended. This is called flagging out and is so the climber can continue to apply pressure to the left foot being in place. Also flagging helps the climber to have stability and balance when performing the moves as well as keeping his hips square to keep himself close to the wall. Here we can see how the climber's main area of support to gain height was to stand up on the right foot after pushing with the left toe against the wall to gain direction. And he pulled himself in to bring himself close to the wall. Now the left leg extended. This is called flagging out. So the climber is able to balance over his areas of support in order to make the reach. As this was a quick move, being dynamic, bumping up to the jug, the climber had dropped the weight immediately, losing pressure at the right foot. And so the climber at this moment is sustaining to two good grips, mainly the one at the jug with the left hand. The right hand, the climber is continuing on the pinch to sustain the grip to keep himself close to the wall. But when the feet come out of contact from the wall, this is called cutting feet. So whenever the climber is ready, he will engage in the core to tighten it up to pick up the feet in order to make a high foot placement. The climber brings the left hand to come out and match the last hold. The climb will be determined completed if the climber is able to demonstrate control over sustaining the grip as well as stability of his body when sustaining the hold. The climber had released the left foot from its foot placement and having a hang on space so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place and quickly engages on a pull up of the right hand so that he was able to release the left hand to bring it over to a higher placement. This is a good choice as the climber's left hand previously was on the pinch hold with restricted movement as the wrist was locked and the elbow was towards the wall. So making a bump up to this hold, the climber is able to be more free on sustaining the edge of the hold as jugs can be held at any direction while being gripped. Due to the climber sustaining to the right hand that is open-handed, it is much harder to grip than the left hand pinch. We can see at this view that the climber's right hand is actually a wide pinch and this is still hard to grip as the climber will have to press the fingers onto the hold in order to sustain the grip. But the climber needs to continue to have his center of gravity underneath the holds that he is gripping at this moment, the reason why the climber keeps the elbows down as much as he can and presses down on the right foot being in place in order to gain height. Once the climber has gained sufficient height, he is able to lock the grips and locking the move of the arm being engaged so that he can now move on potentially the right hand since it's not the best grip to sustain to the last hold. The climbers are starting at a one-hold start. As we can see, both of the hands applied onto the same hold. This is called matching. And the climber places the fingers above the hold and the thumb to be wrapped at the bottom of the hold. This is called a pinch grip, as the climber will be able to squeeze onto the hold in order to create pressure. Now, the climber is standing on the mat. Once the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing in the mat, then the climb will start. The climber figure to continue to bring the left knee to point inwards while continuing to have the same foot placements and sending the left hand across immediately for making the hand placement while sustaining the right hand grip. The climber transferring the right foot a distance to be placed. He had brought his left knee inwards. This so the climber is able to keep his center of gravity close to the wall and steady when making the transition. While sustaining the left hand grip, it's important to note that the elbow needs to be pretty close to the wall. This is because the climber is locking the wrist to sustain the palm pressing against the hold. As the climber brought the right hand over to the last hold, we can see this one being a positive grip as the climber is able to curl the fingers behind the edge of the hold, being a jog. For the climber to achieve the reach, he had to pull himself as close as he can, locking the move and bringing his chest as far in as he can. The left leg being extended throughout the move, this is called flagging out and helps the climber to transfer the weight to the highest foot being in place. And also to balance over his areas of support when sending the right hand out. Also helps the climber to stabilize and staying in place his core close to the wall by pressing on the toe against the wall. It is important that the climber glances down when making a foot placement. This time the climber brings the right foot that was out on the flag to come into a high foot placement. This is when the climber places the ball of the foot at the edge of the hold. The plan for him is to roll the toe on top of the hold. In this case, once the climber is ready to pull onto the highest grip, he will then secure the right foot placement, transferring over the weight to the highest foot to release the left foot from its place. The climber is stepping off the right foot to place it onto the wall. He transfers over the weight to the areas in contact, being the left toe pressing down on the foot, so that he can bring his hips close to the wall. And on the grips he's pulling on them, now that he has placed the weight.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

You can see just how fast and powerfully she's able to generate up to this hold. She's also kind of subtly twisting this right side into the wall. That's gonna bring her hip really close to the wall and it's gonna kind of bring her weight over that right foot so when she drives through it she's having to pull herself in less and kind of able to drive straight up more. So here she's starting with her arms kind of straight and out. This is gonna let her kind of lean back and lean her feet into the wall. That's gonna really maximize the amount of tension and power she can get through her toes. When she kind of pulls herself in, she's kind of just pulling herself off the feet. So this next move is kind of interesting too because she's got this kind of undercling. And she's going to make this big dynamic move. But you can kind of see how she kind of sets up for it. She's got this left foot. It's not really on a thing, but it's driving into the wall. And what that's going to let her do is really push with both feet. So she can push herself into the position to drive off this other foot and stand straight up. Here we can see she's kind of doing a twist lock. So she's getting opposite pose, so left hand's anchoring and holding, right foot's also on driving and she's reaching out with her right hand while kind of flagging and balancing her left foot.

We don't move where the leg and the arm move together on both sides. And the dancer is moving in this way with the movements instead of it being more alternating. And I think that if the dancer would move that way and loosen up here in the upper body and in the arms, the movement would look more natural and less robotic.

The dancer does a really good job of gliding on the balls of their feet and spotting their head to get around seamlessly and transition to the next step. So kudos to them for this advanced salsa. The dancer does a really good job of thinking about being strong and sharp and using those staccato movements. So I would like the dancer in this phrase to think about really when can they be soft and change the movement quality and also when can they incorporate more groundedness and use of the hips. I'll repeat my kind of previous comments from this video, which would be to make sure that they have more attack and are really grounded. The dancer has a really great attack at this moment and precision, so I would encourage them to push this even further to the limit.

So I think by kind of lowering underneath this pinch, you know, so his arms are kind of plumb line straight under, kind of sagging his hips down. I think tension up this right foot into a back leg to give him a little extra power or flagging the foot out to the right to kind of provide a little bit of a tension, a little movement up through his arms.

She could benefit from bending more in her supporting leg, and perhaps finding a little bit more clarity in this extended leg by lengthening through the back of the knee. However, she needs to just time her movement more quickly and efficiently to ensure that she stays on the rhythm even through this accented moment. As the dancer executes this turn series, you can tell that she has a pretty strong grasp over the technique here. She's able to spot her head, which makes her able to move quickly and efficiently around herself, as well as has her arms extended overhead in a quite precise shape, which has a nice line from the tops of her fingers down through her supporting leg. She's also got a fairly strong posture in her upper body, as well as her pelvis, and is able to move through the turn quickly. As the dancer performs a basic salsa step moving forwards and backwards in the space, she demonstrates confidence in the technique of this step. She's got strong execution in her lower body and could use a little bit more movement here in her pelvis as well as some more movement through her arms, perhaps a relaxation through the shoulders, the chest, and the rest of the torso would benefit her here. However, she shows that she understands the basic technique of salsa in this step. The dancer begins with a basic salsa step and a step out and slide from side to side. She demonstrates that she has a beginner to intermediate understanding of the technical elements of salsa. She's able to execute the movements efficiently and cleanly while also staying connected to the rhythm. However, she could embody the rhythm deeper and focus on some more precision in her arms and her upper body, which lacks the precision of her lower body. As the dancer performs a rotation of the shoulders and the pelvis, she's got strong movement up through her arms and in her center of her torso. However, she would benefit from a larger range of motion in her shoulders as well as her pelvis. She's got a nice bend in her knees, but she could bend her knees just a little bit more and also drop her pelvis back more to be more grounded and allow for a greater range of motion in the pelvis. As the dancer performs a more basic step where she's stepping and touching her foot out in front of her while moving her hands in front of and above her, she's able to reconnect with the rhythm more deeply here through the simplicity of this step. Her feet are able to connect to the rhythm and she's got a nice bend in her knees which grounds her movement, as well as pretty significant clarity in her upper body as well. As the dancer opened up to take bigger steps side to side and slice her arm in front of her as she moves side to side She could benefit from some attention to dynamic quality here Her movement is all pretty one note and while it's on tempo with the music it disconnects her from embodying the rhythm", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So now he's put all of the chopped vegetables into a bowl. Here's where his fingers are vulnerable. See where he's holding his cucumber with his fingers pushed out. He should be pressing his fingertips down on the cutting, I mean, on the cucumber, and actually using a flat cut side of them. He's holding the whole barrel and it's already cut, and cucumbers are wet inside, so they tend to slip. It's just probably not the best use of his hand to be holding all four pieces at once. Here he's cut it in half, so he has two halves. He's cut it in half crosswise. Now he's got some grape tomatoes he's cutting and he's about to try to employ that same thing it looks like because his hand is on the tip of this which um I would well let's see what happens. And he's using a technique that's pretty good for keeping your hands out of the way by holding the top of his knife down and then using this hand right here to rock the knife over the onions. It kind of is an indication that he's not very comfortable with his knife and that he's sort of just chopping at it, but it still is better than putting his fingers in jeopardy. Now what would be better is if he actually flattened this hand over the tip of the knife and didn't hold it so close. But again, fingers out of the way is what you're going for. He's cut the end off. Here he has a small cucumber. It's like a mini cucumber. Kind of popular these days. It is an English cucumber with very few or any seeds that is kind of harvested when it's young. Nir's taking a spoon and he's able to stir everything together so you want everything to get well coated. You want the salt and the pepper to be well distributed and everything to be mixed together. I would like to assert that his onion ratio to the rest of the vegetables is off balance and he probably needs to dial back the onion by at least half. He has very little tomato, a little bit of cucumber, and then a whole lot of onion. And here he's adding some oil of some sort. Oil is a great addition. It's got a very slick mouth feel against the cool vegetables. The salt is going to bring out liquid in the vegetables, which will mingle again with the oil nicely and they will have a good flavor depending on what kind of oil you use. And you can use any kind of oil from a toasted walnut oil to this may be just an olive oil. And now he's opted to just cut in half. And he's adding some freshly ground black pepper, which is a delicious addition, a little bit of heat, not hot, hot heat, unless he just puts a ton on there, but it's very fresh and earthy, especially when it's freshly ground. So to start I'd say typically you don't sit down to cut. Now I'm not exactly sure what the circumstances here. He does have adequate counter space that is regular height to cut on. He just may be used to doing it this way but I would encourage anyone at the beginning of their culinary journey to not take this as the norm. It's not a good position to be in. It's you just don't have a lot of control when you're seated and cutting. And here he goes back to that sort of chop thing. Now he's turned it again to get another cut. That would kind of give him four sticks. Yeah, so I would not do that with a tomato. First of all, tomatoes are round, so they roll. You wanna make sure you've got control over the tomato itself. And second of all, it's just not a good way to cut them. They don't really lend themselves because they have that hollow sort of wet inside. They're just gonna kind of squish. and a sprinkle of salt. And you can see this kind of spells onion a lot of places. He has to bring it back into a central group, but he is able to accomplish kind of cutting that onion down by using this technique. So, but not being probably very confident or competent in the kitchen, this is a fairly smart play. So he has some already sliced onion here. They're in slivers, and he's just moved a handful of them to his cutting board.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

He has originally continued to sustain into two areas of support and had made a move before making this other move consecutively. Now the left hand, he's sustaining it with an entry at the top where he gets to slide the fingers behind the edge of the hold. And as we can see, the climber keeps the right leg extended. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to balance over the moves and helps the climber transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place. Here the climber has dropped the right foot from its place to extend the leg. This is called flagging out. Now because the foot is on space, then he's able to transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place. Now the climber is pushing down on the left foot being in place and pulling himself down on that right hand grip in order to release the left hand from its placement. The climber brings the left foot at a high foot placement and presses the middle of the foot against the hold. This so that he can push away from the hold in order to stay underneath his grips. The climber brings the right hand to come into a match by touching the hold. And the climber must demonstrate controlling the stability over his body positioning when making the move up to the last hold. Once the climber is able to demonstrate this, then he has completed the climb. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet when making a new foot placement. On this one he's sending the left foot into a small foot chip. And this has a small edge so it's important that the climber is exact on how to place the edge of his toe towards the small edge of that foot chip. Once the climber gets to apply pressure into that higher foot placement, then he will bring his center of gravity close to the wall to then transfer over the weight to the left foot. The climber brings the right hand to come into a match at the same hold. This is a jug so the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the edge of the hold and extend the arms. This is called a rest position because this is good to make for recovering when performing the route as he had brought his right foot up into a higher foot placement. Now the climber is able to glance over at this time to plan the next move and whenever he is ready he will then engage on a pull up and step up over the highest foot being in place. The climber is applying his hands inside of a chalk bucket. This is a white powder that the climber will cover up the palms in order to gain a better grip when sustaining to the holds of the wall, as well as absorbing any sweat that may be coming from his hands. The climber was able to bring the left hand two consecutive times. So after making one move and does a move once again, this is called bumping, especially when only continuing to stay in the same areas of support when making the move. As the climber secured the right hand grip being on a pinch hold which is wide, this one the climber must apply friction by closing the grip and dropping the weight. So in this case the climber will have to force with the elbow pulling down in order to sustain the right hand grip. As we can see the climber once making the hand placement he adjusts the left foot to roll the toe to come above the hold and releases the right foot in this moment to transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place. The climbers are starting on a two-hand hold start. On each hand, the climber has slightly two different sizes of holds. So the left hand, he's holding onto a jug where he's able to place the fingertips behind the edge of the hold. And this one has a thick lip, so the climber can place the thumb on the outside to sustain the hold by squeezing the grip. Now, with the right hand, the climber is sustaining to an open-hand grip. This one, he's able to cup it by sending the thumb over to the left side and applying the fingers above the hold. Because this is open-hand, the climber must apply friction in order to sustain the grip. And we'll have to drop the weight by keeping the arms extended in order to sustain the right-hand grip. So now the climber is placing the right foot onto the wall, and the climb will start until he's no longer standing on to the mat and the feet are onto the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

However, we want the player's shooting hand to get even more underneath the ball, allowing his fingertips to rest on the ball, giving space between his palm and the ball. We also want to tuck the player's elbow as we look on the right side of the frame, again inside his body's frame to allow his elbow to be aligned better towards the front of the rim, giving the ball a better chance of staying in the correct alignment after the release. Looking on the left side of the frame on our player's attempted jump shot, we can notice that the player's follow-through is now shifting towards the right side of the rim. Again, not allowing the ball to stay in the correct alignment it needs. The improvement the player needs to make as we look on the right side of the frame is to keep his follow-through higher above his shoulders to allow the ball to gain more arc, accuracy, and rotation to get above the rim as well as the player jumping on his jump shot. The player also needs to keep his follow-through still in the middle of his face to allow the ball to stay in the correct alignment it needs to go inside the rim. Looking at the release of the player's attempted jump shot on the right frame, we can notice that some improvements the player needs to make is to jump on his release. Even though the player did a decent job of loading and squatting down in his position to allow the ball to get enough lift on his release, it defeats the purpose if the player does not jump because the ball will continue to not get the lift and power arc and accuracy it needs to get above the rim and have a better and higher opportunity of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the player's release on the right side of the frame on his attempted jump shot, we can notice that improvements the player needs to make is to again jump on his jump shot allowing the ball to gain more momentum, arc and accuracy it needs to get above the rim and have a better opportunity of developing the proper angle it needs dropping inside the rim. In results of the player not jumping, the ball will not gain enough arc and accuracy to get above the rim making it a much more difficult attempt. Looking at the player go into his attempted jump shot on the right frame, we can notice that the player does well at incorporating the correct footwork by stepping initially with his right foot first since he is a left-handed shooter and step in secondly with his left foot allowing him to go into his shooting motion. Looking at the player go into his release on the right side of the frame on his mid-range jump shot attempt. We want the player on his release to jump off the ground, getting a significant lift, allowing the ball to gain more arc accuracy, and power to get above the rim and to develop the proper angle of dropping inside the rim. Looking on the left side of the frame on our player's attempted jump shot, we can notice that again his follow-through is shifting side to side on his release. This does not allow the ball to stay in the correct alignment and needs to have a opportunity of dropping inside the rim. As we look on the right side of the frame, we want the player to keep his follow-through above his shoulder in a high release, allowing the ball to gain more arc and accuracy and power it needs to get above the rim. We also want the player to keep his follow-through still in front of his face, having his five fingers snap downward towards the direction of the rim. Looking at the release on the left side of the frame, and our player's attempted jump shot, we can notice that, again, the player's follow-through is moving side to side. We want the player to keep his follow-through straight in alignment, having his five fingers and wrist pointing downward towards the rim right in the middle, allowing the ball to stay in the correct alignment it needs to potentially go inside the rim. Looking on the left side of the frame on our player's attempted jump shot, we also again want the player to keep his follow through aligned in front of his face, having his wrist and follow through snap downward going towards the rim. As we see on the left frame, the player's follow through is going towards the left, which is allowing the ball to continue in that same direction. Looking at the player go into his shooting pocket on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player did a decent job getting his hand underneath the ball. However, we will want the player to get his hand even more underneath the ball, having his fingers rest on the ball in a gap between his palm and the ball. We also want, as we look on the right frame, to have the player's elbow be inside his body's frame, having it aligned towards the front of the rim, creating a better opportunity for the ball to be directed accurately inside the rim. Looking at the left side of the frame on a player's release on his attempted jump shot, we can notice that the player's follow through is going towards the left side of the frame, not allowing the ball to stay in the correct alignment it needs to go inside the rim.

We also want the player, as we look on the left side of the frame, on his attempted jump shot to keep his elbow tucked inside his body frame to allow the ball to stay in the correct alignment on his release. As we see, the player's release is going towards the left side or the right side of the basket. We're not sure. Therefore, we want the player to snap his wrist and fall through in front of his face, preferably to keep the ball in the correct alignment.

The action of having the off arm up to protect the shot protects the ball from the defense who's coming from his left side attempting to block or contest the shot. They will have to come across his left arm, which will be a foul, or if the referee doesn't call a foul, this arm will be able to slow the defense down long enough for the offensive player to release the ball from his right hand before the defense has the opportunity to block or contest the shot. After he makes a layup on the left side of the basket, the ball goes through the net. He catches the ball and he does a sort of a hop step to the right side of the basket where he ends up stepping with his right foot and then he's going to pick up his left foot and bring it closer to his right foot so that his right foot would be positioned here and then his left foot is positioned here and then he's going to jump off of two feet to shoot the ball on the right side of the basket. This is the incorrect footwork as when the ball goes through the net, he wants to be in position where he can catch the ball, but as he's catching the ball, he steps to the right side of the rim with his left foot first and then he wants, after he catches the ball, he wants to swing his right foot to square himself up to the basket. So now that he has his left foot positioned here and his right foot positioned here, now he jumps off of two feet in order to shoot the ball on the right side of the basket. The player here is demonstrating the Mike and Drew where you jump off of two feet to shoot each layup and as he's on the right side of the basket, he correctly shoots the ball with his right hand. Looking at the placement of the ball on the backboard, we can see here that he places the ball in the upper right corner of the square on the backboard. Since he was able to hit the upper right corner of the square from the right side of the basket on his layup attempt, the ball was able to bounce off of the backboard and drop in for the made layup. After he makes a layup on the right side of the basket, he uses the proper footwork as he catches the ball. He steps to the left side of the basket with his right foot, and then he swings his left foot into position to where it is on the ground right now. So he has great positioning with his right foot here and his left foot here. All he has to do is go up and jump and shoot the ball with his left hand on the left side of the basket. However, he's going to end up picking up his right foot and placing it even closer to his left foot in order for him to jump for his shot. By him picking up his right foot and placing it closer to his left foot, that makes the footwork that he demonstrated incorrect. As what he just, what he demonstrates right here is a travel, but if he was able to just jump immediately from this position where his feet are now and not pick up this foot and place it closer to his left foot, but if he just would have left his feet as they currently are and immediately jump and shot the ball with his left hand, that would be the correct footwork. The shooter is now on the left side of the basket and shooting a layup on the left side of the rim and he is using his right hand to shoot the layup. When we are on the left side of the basket during the mic and drill we want to shoot the layup with our left hand and we do not want to shoot the ball with our right hand or have the shot be a two-handed shot. The release of the ball should only be with our left hand on the left side of the basket during the mic and drill.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Reaching over into the screen hold right here. So in this starting position we can see the clamber is doing a good job of keeping his arms in a straight position. While his legs are in a bent position here showing that the clamber has a good understanding of where the most amount of strength can come from which is going to be his legs. So you definitely want to be able to get yourself in this loaded position here so then that way it sets you up as a clamber to be able to produce the most amount of power for this dino. So this is a good starting position to see from the clamber. So here we can see the climber is now moving upwards into the dyno. But what I'm noticing from the climber is that he is actually allowing himself to kind of internally rotate his right knee over to the left. So what the climber is doing by doing it in this fashion, he's actually using the left foot to kind of push himself off of that foot. So that he can kind of direct a lot of his body weight over to the right. And then as he maintains his right foot on that foothold, he rotates the knee so that the right side of his body gets closer to the wall. And by doing that, it helps to actually decrease the reach that he needs to do with the right hand. So this is a really good idea from the climber in order to try and incorporate his hips into the movement to try and complete this dyno.

And in this position we can see that they were hanging on with the left hand right here. And they did decide to place a right foot on the wall right here as well as a left foot. So by putting their feet in this position right here, what it naturally does is it kind of forces her body to kind of hang back and away from the wall. Just because she's really unable to really rotate or pivot around those two points of feet. So this kind of makes it a little bit hard for the clamber to really engage this right handhold that she's going for. And more importantly to move from it. Just because a lot of her body weight is hanging away from the wall. And it does seem like as if the handhold was a little difficult for the clamber to hang onto. Because she keeps on kind of bouncing and fixing up her right hand to try and hang onto that hold in the best way possible. So this starting position does make it a little bit difficult to really continue moving from here. So I would definitely encourage the clamber to find an alternative Veda where it allows her to rotate and pivot around her lower body. So then that way she can place more body weight on her legs and help reduce the amount of weight that her arms are experiencing. So then that way this handhold can feel a little bit better.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Not only is their heads down, but their energy also ends up being kind of down here to the ground. So by looking up it would raise their head and fix their alignment a little bit. And then I would also encourage them to roll those shoulders forward, up, and back so they exude confidence. Here, for this whole last section, all of my previous comments apply. So, yes, being really strong and really taking the time to go back to the drawing board and practice because this dance has really good bones or a really good structure. Like the dancers know what they're supposed to be doing. They have an idea. They're connected. But really adding in all those layers of rhythm and musicality, space, cutting across space, taking bigger steps, understanding how to be grounded, how to be lifted in the chest and the head and the neck. Understanding the partner connection and the mechanics of that will increase the overall quality of the dance and the overall proficiency of this choreography. Here I repeat my previous comments about really being strong with the footwork, using your body as a percussive instrument. Notice how the dancers are looking down, and I would also encourage them to roll those shoulders again forward, up, and back, and just take bigger steps and be, have much more energy and strength and attack throughout this entire dance. Notice how both dancers are looking at the floor. I would encourage them to look up and out or look at each other to have that stronger mind-body connection to the music and as well as to each other. I would encourage the dancers to be more grounded. So when they're more grounded, then they'll be able to spin each other with more ease and really working with spinning one finger. So maybe holding that pointer or index finger and then using the other hand. The dancer, the opposite dancer uses the other hand to kind of spin around it. Those are just like little details to help them, especially for this strong connection here in the arms to be able to communicate with each other. Because this dance is based in a lot of footwork, I would encourage the dancers to be very clear about where they're articulating the foot. Is it whole foot? Is it half of the foot? Is it the ball of the foot? Is it the heel? Is it the side of the foot? This is very crucial in a dance like this, especially because we can audibly hear the steps. And because we can audibly hear the steps, the next layer of that is to making sure that they're both in sync and really tight with the steps that they are attempting to do. We can physically hear when they are together versus when they're not. So it's very important that the dancers work on nailing the footwork. So it becomes more of similar to the qualities of a tap dance where you can hear when somebody messes up, right? So really being clear about those footwork or it becomes like a drill team kind of step dance where you're really heavily reliant on the rhythm. So the dancers need to be very strong in what the rhythms are and using their body as a percussive instrument in order for this to work. I would encourage the dancers to take way bigger steps, especially for this eight count basic, and to be more grounded. So they have a nice plie here, but sending those hips back would allow them to be able to kind of do this swing under curve, where they kind of push their hips on this pendulum to go different directions in space. Having that bigger, wider stance and taking bigger steps will help them to be able to cut across space quickly in the future.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This will result in an overcooked and relatively rubbery end product. So the idea is to minimize the handling of the egg and definitely not flipping it over continuously. Here the egg has been flipped over and you have visible browning from the underside of the egg. In a classic omelet, the egg is not flipped at all and the goal is to not have any browning on the egg. Oil is being added to the saut\u00e9 pan. Oil is an acceptable fat that can be used to make an omelette. Traditionally, a classic French omelette is made utilizing clarified butter as the fat. The preparer has selected a saut\u00e9 pan, which is the proper pan shape to choose. In this case, it should be slightly smaller in diameter than the one that is chosen, typically 6 to 8 inches in diameter or 15 to 20 centimeters. Here the egg is folded in half, which is the proper procedure for a classic omelet. Here the technique of tilting the pan so that any uncooked egg slides to the edges and then underneath to be cooked is the proper procedure to use. The egg mixture is being added to the saute pan, and there is a loud sizzle when that egg is added to the pan. This is an indication that the pan is too hot, and you will likely have browning of the egg mixture, which is what you're trying to avoid. In order to prevent this from happening, a much lower flame on a consistent basis will give you a better end product. Here you have chopped onion and chili, raw, that are being added to the bowl in which the egg will be added to. Any vegetables to be added to an omelette should be saut\u00e9ed first, separate from the eggs, and then added at the end when the omelette is complete. Here you notice a relatively high flame underneath the saut\u00e9 pan. In order to prevent your egg mixture from browning, it's best to work with a very low flame when making a French omelette. The egg is being mixed using a spoon. A better choice for mixing the egg would be a fork or a whisk. This way you would be able to thoroughly mix the white and the yolk together. With the spoon you end up getting streaks of white in with your egg mixture. Here one egg is selected to make the omelet. It is being cracked and placed into the bowl with the raw onions and the raw chili. For a classic French omelet you would need to choose a minimum of two eggs, maximum of three eggs to create the end product of a classic omelet.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

Again, really nice use of the arms. And in this moment she's also kind of shaking her hips side to side as she steps. So really accenting the full movement of her body. So here's one moment where I think her arms are really beautiful in this step. She's stepping forward and back, again keeping it really light and knees slightly bent, could bend a little bit more, but she has this really nice wave throughout her shoulders and arms as she steps. So it's really, really beautiful to see that in this moment instead of the arms rolling around in a circle. So here she is in a nice lunge to the back so her right leg is planted on the floor and slightly bent. Her left leg is extended out straight with the foot fully on the floor. Her arms are kind of reaching behind her just kind of hanging back as she does a body roll with her chest and hips. So nice different stance instead of having the arms up you really see the roll in her body. So here where she adds a little personality as she steps and turns and rotates her body to the side. Again she's hitting that accent with her hip and then also adding some different arms. So different kind of improvised movements with her arms for this part. And the stance she has her right now her left leg is planted on the floor and then the right leg is touching out so just the ball of the foot is on the floor. I'm sorry this is her right leg and then the left leg is out. So here the dancer is just taking a step out to the side and then kind of popping her hip as she steps. She's also swinging her arms so they kind of make a side kind of a U shape as she swings them out to the side and steps out to the side. So really nice job here. Nice job just kind of accentuating the hip movement and the rhythm and style of the music. So here she does a little square step first to move around and then she jumps out in this position. So the right knee is slightly bent, all the weight is on the right leg. The left leg extended out. I think maybe this leg can kind of go a bit more to the side, so not quite as forward. The arm is stretched out over top and then the other arm is crossed in front. So again, really nice job keeping the line and the full body all the way down. So here again another spot where she spins around twice and then extended those arms up over her head as well as doing a couple of different little waves and things with her arms as she steps forward and spins around. So here she walks side to side using the space. She draws that arm around, so nice eye contact following the arm.

She's circulating her shoulders with nice relaxed but posed arms out to her sides. And she's moving this upper body while also maintaining this different rhythm happening, this quicker rhythm happening in her feet and her knees. She's got a lot of nice movement in her pelvis as well. Overall, she's got a strong command of both the rhythm and the technique here and is adding some nice dynamic qualities to her movement as well. As the dancer goes to perform the swinging motion with the arm in this kind of like pendulum motion in front of her She has a nice bend in her knees. However, her torso never really comes over her pelvis. Everything just kind of stays upright above her lower body She also appears to rush through this movement quite quickly Perhaps indicating that she forgot the choreography at this moment or is having a hard time remembering what comes next in this movement phrase During this turn, the dancer overall executes it pretty well, however she would really benefit from spotting her head more effectively and lengthening this arm above her head to create a more, a better line in her arm and also in her upper body in general. Her lower body's got a nice bend in the knees, it's got a fair amount of movement in the pelvis but not to the extent that it's throwing her off rhythm or off balance, but the benefit really could come from spotting that head so she's able to move around more quickly and more efficiently. As the dancer performs this transitional step touch side to side while changing her facing about the room, she appears relaxed and confident. She has a nice command over the technical skill here, and is able to reconnect to the rhythm after losing that connection slightly. As the dancer is performing this fairly basic step, step touching side to side while keeping a nice bounce through her body, she has a nice bend in her lower, or in her knees, and her lower body in general is executing the movement quite efficiently. She's got a nice shape in her arms and her torso is fairly relaxed, which shows that she has technical skill, and she's able to maintain that technical skill while also staying connected to the rhythm. However, her head is performing some awkward movements that are happening in contrast to the rhythm that's being maintained in the rest of her body, which is throwing her off rhythm slightly overall and creating kind of an awkward dynamic happening between her head and the rest of her body. As the dancer begins his performance, she shows that she has a fairly strong command over the technique and over the embodiment of the rhythm here. She really remains connected to the rhythm, creating nice shapes with her upper body that appear relaxed and positioned at the same time. Her torso overall has nice positioning to it. She's got a slight bend in her knees and she's able to stay in control of both the technical skill and the rhythmic embodiment here. As a dancer performs a series of turns, she demonstrates a pretty strong command over technique, particularly by spotting her head throughout this series of turns and keeping her body fairly in line below her with a nice bend in her knees. Overall, she takes control of her technical skill here. She's off rhythm slightly, however, her technical skill is keeping her on track. Here the dancer appears to struggle in a moment of transition, perhaps forgetting the choreography. She has kind of this shocked expression on her face where it appears that she's looking off to the side for help perhaps. And her body's kind of taking on this stiffer stance, which we haven't really seen. It's pretty uncharacteristic of her so far. So it appears that she might have a little bit of trouble memorizing the choreography as she's performing it, which will throw her off rhythm slightly and make it harder for her to get into the next step. As the dancer flicks her hands and her wrists before reaching out into this shape, she shows that she has a command over the dynamics of this performance as well. She creates a nice shape with her arms, with her hands relaxed but positioned out to the sides of her. She's got a nice position in her head as well as her spine. Again, she's got this slight bend in her knees. Overall, her feet are staying on rhythm.

A slight adjustment the player should make in this Mikan drill is his ball placement.

Bringing his ball above his shoulders will help him with his power and accuracy shooting the ball towards the rim. Also, we want to encourage this player to have his left leg extended out to be almost identical as his left hand extending out. We want the player to jump at the same time having motion going towards the rim. As we can see on the left frame, the ball hit the middle of the square, causing it to come off the rim. Our target is the corner of the square, giving the ball a better angle of dropping into the net. As we can see on this player's finish, he is jumping backwards from the rim, giving the ball a less likely chance of going in. If he would jump towards the rim, he will have a higher chance of the ball being able to go in. This will help the players balance and power on his finishes, guiding him to finish towards the rim to gain an opportunity of getting a foul call instead of fading away from the rim, avoiding contact. This player is attempting to do the Mike and drill. The Mike and drill in basketball is designed to help players improve on their footwork and their finishing skills towards the basket. As the player is attempting to shoot his right-handed mic-in layup, his foot placement is currently correct.

As we can see on the left frame, the player's follow through extension is currently correct. His five fingers are facing towards the rim. Our target point is the corner of the square on the backboard, giving the ball better accuracy of going in. As we see the player do his second attempt on the left side of the basket, we encourage players to jump off their right foot, having their left hand extended out towards the rim, not fading away as this player is doing here.

That way the dancer can release more here in the pelvis and have more mobility in the hips and in the waist.

This was so the climber was able to quickly bring the right hand over to the hold at reach. As we can see the way the climber is placing the hand is above the flat area of the hold and the climber is placing the fingers to wrap around the pyramid in order to sustain the grip. The climber bringing the right foot over to come into place. She has raised the hips and for some reason has lost her Center of gravity dropping the right foot straight to the mat Ending the climb The climber yet to start the climb, she is figuring out the hand placement at the start hold, where this is a one-hold start, so the climber must place both of the hands onto the hold. And when both of the hands are in the same hold, this is called matching. Because the climber was able to secure the grips by dropping her weight, the climber is performing a foot switch. This type of technique is called the jump off, jump on. So the climber has jumped the toe off the foot placement to allow space for the left toe to come into place above the hold. This is a technique that works but is not the most accurate. This is because it takes a fair bit of energy for the climber when performing the switch. And it can be very difficult to do on small holds. In this case, the climber needs to make sure that the pressure is applied immediately so she doesn't lose the foot placement. The climber in keeping the left leg extended out is to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. This is called flagging out. To support the climber in bringing her right side of the body towards the wall to help the reach, the climber had brought the right knee to come inwards. The climbers is starting at a sit start. Sit starts are known to add a difficulty of grade to the climb. This is because the climber will have to raise the hips to transfer over the weight to her hand and feet placements.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Maybe maybe he's going off a little bit too soon. Maybe that's throwing off the accuracy of the shot on the glass. But again, she picks it up off that dribble and puts that right hand under the ball. And again, I love this shooting hand, the right hand to be behind the ball and left hand on the side. Pick it up like that and then shoot the ball out in front of the right chest. I love this one big dribble she takes and I'll show you this it's so important maybe get her eyes up here a little bit but one big dribble out in front of you see it's not beside her she pushes it out in front of her and that momentum of that power dribble sets up the footwork. Again, just beautiful footwork, pushing off the left, pulling the right knee up, squaring her hips, raising the ball here with two hands, I believe. This might be the guide hand coming off. Looks like a little bit better here. The ball's a little bit more behind, but that has a lot to do with the accuracy, how it comes off that shooting hand. Again, two hands on the ball, she takes it up, nice job, good footwork, plant, lift, trying to get that angle here. All this is really nice. She has really good intentions here. I just wish she would move that right hand a little bit behind the ball, take it up with two hands, and just soft touch on this square. Again, just really good footwork, uses that one dribble to set up the footwork, plant the left. Here, see how she's got her hand under the ball. Wish she'd just pulled that hand more behind the ball, keep that left hand on a little longer. I think that's why she loses control a little bit as it leaves her hand. Here's the lift, push off that left foot, pull the right leg. You know, she's doing everything right. Looking at the ball, the ball may be coming off a little bit too early. She may be shooting it a little bit too early. It's hard to tell. But she is shooting it underhanded. I like her shooting hand to maybe be a little bit more behind the ball. You just don't have as much control when you shoot it underhanded. I will add that. Much better here. I think the ball has a chance, but she's still shooting it underhanded, scooping it. Again, not as fluid, not as fundamental as you'd like to see. Again, she has beautiful footwork, beautiful extension, covers a lot of space here. I just would love to, I think this is why she's missing the marks, is, you know, that right hand moves underneath the ball, left hand comes off a little bit too soon, and she's kind of lifting it instead of shooting it. Therefore, just again, with one hand, you lose a little bit of the control when it comes off that hand. You don't really know where it's going to go. Yeah, she's still under shooting it underhand and I just think it's throwing off a little bit of the accuracy of the shot. Again, I really love this. She's got some ups, pushing offs, using it to help her square up, but I love, you know, it has to do with her hand placement on the ball after the dribble. Let's get that shooting hand more behind the ball instead of under the ball. Again, here's that foot takeoff left, pulls that right leg in, squares her body. I'd like this guide arm to kind of be up here a little bit more to kind of balance the body, hold off a defender. She brings it back, therefore the weight shifts this way a little bit. Pretty good extension. Again, that ball's a little behind the hand. Let's get that ball out in front of the hand here. Here's the lift. Yeah, she's got her right hand under the ball again, just doesn't have as much control of it coming out at hand. Let's move that right hand to behind the ball and let's shoot the ball out in front of our right shoulder. Good work here with the feet. There it is, left foot plant followed by that right leg, two hands, eyes are up. The participant is moving left to right to shoot a reverse, right hand reverse layup. She goes off the correct foot, has really good lifts, squares her hips. You know, I just think she's got a little bit of the angle here to hit the top of the square, but I love how the ball's coming off these fingers here. But she's got really good ups here. Nice look. Here's the shot. Much better with that. She's still lifting it. I think this is the palm of the hand. Here's the index finger, the thumb. Again, probably he's throwing off where it hits on the backboard. But beautiful footwork. Gets up off the ground very nicely. But she does do a good job of squaring up. You know, I think this is better here. I think the hands here on the side, which is a lot better. Good extension here. She's got some ups too. I like that. See, she's got it, she's got that ball on the palm of her hand. Again, that's, and then starting the shot right here, loses it a little bit as she lets go of it. But good footwork, good extension here of the right knee. Here's the lift. Again, we kind of would want this elbow to be more straight. Snap the follow-through hand down. Again, it looks like it's going to hit the top of the square here, but I love her footwork. Does a great job with that. And, you know, she ends up a little bit too far under, kind of misses the mark here. See the ball's hitting up here. I just think it's when you toss, shoot it underhanded, you again don't have as much control of the ball coming off the hand. But lands a little awkward here off balance, would like to have a better landing here. Takes a nice big dribble here to set up her footwork. Love how her eyes go up. She's got two hands on the basketball, being strong with the ball as she moves left to right.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

If the ball touch previous had been taken from around this spot, that angle could be made to go across the body and allow him to stay in control of the ball and not have to go reaching for it. The player is executing a nice, a good little inside shuffle. Contact with the inside of the left foot, and at the same time, hop with the right. So the entire body shifts at the same speed as the ball shifts, and then this allows him to take a touch with the right foot when the ball stops. The player has moved through this sequence with the ball very, very much stuck under their feet. We really want the ball to be out at least a foot from their body and allows their feet to actually move behind the ball, to the side of the ball. When the ball is this close, it prevents them from actually being able to pick their head up and see where they are or change direction. Players touch with the inside of the left foot was too big, it was too much power on it. The direction was good But it's meant that they don't have time to put their right foot down, move their left foot and then use their right foot touch when they're more behind the ball. They have instead have to reach for the ball with their right foot in order to maintain control of it and this is not what we want. We want that body to be closer and behind the ball so they can have full control over it. The player has chosen to roll the ball across the body of the left foot, which means their right foot now pushes the ball straight into the cone, which is not the desired outcome. They have not left themselves enough space to actually beat the cone slash defender. The player is moving the ball through the cones. You should leave the ball to get to around this area here and really make a bigger zigzag pattern through the cones. Because he now takes the ball so soon and so close to the cone here, he has to push the ball forwards and too far away from his body so that it beats the cone. Players execute a nice little sequence through here using the inside of their foot to push the ball forwards and then the inside of the same foot to move the ball across. Inside of the opposite foot to move the ball forwards and inside of the foot to move the ball across. This is a good rhythmical pattern as they've executed. The player has taken a touch that is too big and has forced them to have to reach out for the ball with their right foot to maintain control of it. We would want them to take a softer touch, so while the ball is rolling in this direction, we still want it to end up here, but we want it to be rolling at a speed where they could have moved their left foot, moved their right foot and then been able to stay behind the ball. This would bring them more into balance, ready to make this action. Players touch with the inside of the left foot. The ball should be going in this direction, moving back across and between the cone. But instead, the contact point on the ball has been behind it, has actually just pushed the ball forward in the direction that it shouldn't be going. The player has contacted the ball and the ball needs to be rolling across his body so that he can stay behind it and in control of it. The touch here where it's behind the ball, contact point, has pushed the ball forwards and this is just going to speed him up and he's not going to be in position to actually dribble or maintain control of the ball. The player has shown good use of the inside of both feet in this sequence, shifting the ball from right to left, from right to left, from right to left as they've slalomed through the cones. This is good. The player is moving at a very slow speed in and out of the cones. This could be relative to their level, but what we would want them to be doing is trying to do this at the fastest speed they possibly can in order to improve. The player is trying to dribble in and out of the cones, so an appropriate turn here would be to drag the ball back with their left foot and then move the ball across their body with the outside of their right or the inside of their left if they can adjust themselves.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

One good thing here, he found a great spot to hit the backboard off of to get that extra support to ensure that the ball can go through the basket. This actually looks good, with the ball rolling off her two fingertips. But for this drill, you want to be able to flick your wrist, jump off that one foot, and have the ball look high and protected with two hands versus shooting with one hand, as she's doing right now. Starting the drill like this is not the typical way to start the miking drill. You want to maybe start underneath the bottom and choose the side to go to first. As you can see, climbing off two feet, the micro drill is designed to jump off your right foot if you're shooting with your left hand and jump off your left foot if you're shooting with your right hand. Right here, the ball sits kind of low in the mic and drill. You want to maybe keep it up high as possible, as much as you can to keep it away from defenders or people trying to strip it away from you. Right here in this drill, there is no dribbling in this Micah drill. Just being able to shoot layups, get it out the net, or get it off the rim, and be able to elevate on opposite leg and hands to shoot it.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So that's very good The dancer is now lost in the routine, so she's not executing the footwork correctly. Instead, she's shuffling her feet a bit and not articulating her footwork. It's also nice about confidence here that her chin is lifted up with her eyes looking forward Even though a lot of things are going wrong this little moment of confidence here is nice The dancer makes another attempt to get back into the routine, which is good, but when she's extending her legs outward horizontally in these Cubans or side basic salsa step, she should be taking larger steps out to the side. They're too small, close to the center of her body. The dancer is a bit frozen again in terms of forgetting the routine. So her feet are basically glued to the ground when she should be dancing and traveling across the floor. The dancer starts the routine late. She starts four counts too late. So now everything she continues to do will be behind in the music. The dancer forgets the routine once again, which is clear in terms of her looking at the side to her left and also the footwork in which she's doing here in place is very small. She's taking up a very small portion of the room and not actually traveling. The dancer tries to get back into the routine here and back on course Which is admirable and also shows good perseverance and dance Also, the dancer is looking towards the left because she missed the musical cue.

Looking at the hand placement of the player going into her mid-range attempt to jump shot on the left frame, again, we will want the player to move her guide hand, her left hand, on the side of the ball, laying flat, similar to giving a high five, allowing the ball to stay in the correct alignment before going into her shooting motion and having no effect on the release.

Getting to our target point and dropping inside. Looking on the right frame as our player is going into her mid-range attempt to jump shot, an important detail that can help the player create a quicker release is getting her body placement position lower in the athletic stance, allowing the player to go into her shooting motion quicker, helping the ball create more arc and power to get above the rim, potentially helping it drop inside the rim.

So if the climber was to attempt this again it's important that the climber checks the wall before committing to the climb. That way the climber doesn't spend so much time trying to adjust hand placements and foot placements to ones on the wall. At this time the climber has sent the left hand out to the next grip where she originally had placed the hand and places with the palm facing towards the lip of the hold. The hand placed from underneath, this is called an undercling and the climber is able to secure the grip by pinching the hold with the thumb being pressed from above. Once the climber secures the grip, she then leans back to extend the arms. This is called the rest position because the climber is not engaging on the arms and this is a good time for the climber to recover. The climber wasn't able to secure the hand placement so it retracts the move and comes back to match the start hold. The climber brings the left foot to come into place and is mostly pressing against the side of the hold. Now the ball of the foot, we can see it being pressed at the edge of the hold and the toe is basically at the top of the hold. So that later on when the climber gets to transfer over to the left side, she will be able to roll the toe above the hold. The climber has released the left hand and had engaged into a slight pull up. This was because the climber wasn't feeling secured on the grip and again is replacing the hand over the edge. In doing so, the climber's left foot has slipped out of the hold due to a lack of pressure when trying to replace the hand grip. The climber again has made his foot switch, glancing down at the feet again bringing the right toe to come into place where the left toe was. And once the climber releases the left foot has brought it over to the hold a distance to be placed over the block where she initially had it. The climber wasn't successful at making the right hand placement as an undercling, so instead has retracted the move and gotten position again to match the start hold. Now the climber is glancing down at the feet because she is performing a foot switch, where she is bringing first the left toe to come into place at the foot hold before releasing the right toe from its place. The climbers are starting at a one-hold start. When both of the hands are placed into the same hold, this is called matching, and she's able to wrap the hands at the lip of the hold. This type of hold is called a jug. The climber is now turning the right side of the body towards the wall to send the right hand grip over the left hand This so the climber can bring into place The right hand as an undercling same ways that she was doing it before with the left hand The climber is sending the left hand out on her first move, placing the fingers underneath the lip of the hold and into the hold with the thumb staying on the outside so the climber is able to create pressure by pinching on the hold. This type of hand placement is called undercling as the climber is placing it from underneath a jug that is upside down. We can see the climber bring the right toe to come into place at the hold. This by bringing the knee also inwards so the climber is prepared to send the center of gravity on keeping the right side towards the wall when bringing the left foot up to placement. Now the climb will start when the climber is no longer standing on the mat.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

For the stroke that the violinist is using, it would best serve them if they're a little bit closer to the frog. Since they're a little bit further out in the middle of the bow, they're losing out on some weight. If they miss this shift that's coming from an open string, this is a challenging shift, but it's just good for them to practice having a lot of repetition to make sure that they're comfortable where they're going. The piece is coming to an end, and for a better musical effect, they can start slowing down. The violinist is using some vibrato on the first finger. The violins are using more speed and weight to play on the G string, getting a darker sound. This is a different section in the piece where it is more lyrical. The violins can make sure that they're using more bow and very legato. They don't get a strong start with this very first note because their bow is not firmly set on the string. They can make sure that the hair is directly on the string and that they're set with their weight and then pull the bow. This is another expressive shift. This one could even be bigger and using more bow to make it more expressive. The violinist hardly ever goes to the frog while playing, and I think it's mainly because of their arm here is very stationary. After a certain point they can help bring it in, which will bring the frog closer when they're playing. The violins are still playing a lot out in the tip where they're getting more of a lighter sound. For better articulation and balance in the bow, they could play a little bit closer to the frog. There's a retardando here where they're slowing down. It could actually happen a little bit sooner for a better musical effect. When playing on the A string and the E string, they could make use of their forearm opening from the elbow to get more freedom in the bow. They're trying to get a stronger note on the lower strings, but they're playing really far on the bow. Like my previous point, they could be next to the frog, and also move in their upper arm so that they can have more of a center over the far strings. They're playing at the tip of the bow so that they can have a lighter sound for this piece. The violist is playing a harmonic. They can get the harmonic to sound even better if their bow is just a little bit closer to the bridge. This is another expressive shift. In this section, the violins could use their upper arm and bring it a little bit closer so they get more weight over on this far string on the G. The violinist is doing a good job of keeping the bow straight with the bridge to help maximize getting the best sound. This is a very expressive shift. The violins could actually be using more bow during this shift to make it sound more expressive. They do this up bow where they use a lot of speed and they get off the string to have a big emphasis on this last note. This is a very musical way of signifying that it's the end of the piece. The violinist needs to work on bow distribution so that they have more bow hair for this last note. They're really at the end of running out of bow.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So it looks like the position he's in is maybe not the best position. And so maybe it's a grip thing and maybe the holes are too small, the position's just a little weird, but it seems like, or maybe he's tired, but it seems like he's just not really able to pull that well from the position he currently is in. It almost looks like he's kind of slightly barn door-y. So it's like, it's kind of looks like he's scrunched on the right side, so right hand, right foot. And he kind of, when he tries to generate movement from that right side, his whole body kind of comes out. So it kind of looks almost like he's maybe slightly barn door-y, or not as well tensioned on the left side. So maybe what it could be is, I can't see his right knee, but it looks like maybe it's twisted out. So maybe if he can kind of twist that right knee in to the left and kind of do another twist lock, or maybe bring his left foot up and do some sort of twist lock, but like kind of drop that knee and create tension so he can stand off this left foot and be opposite opposed. Starts off in a nice position. This kind of bottom foot, so he's able to kind of post his left foot here. Then this right foot down low is kind of able to press into this wall where it flattens out. So he's able to get a lot of leverage even though it's not on hold. He's able to use that to kind of drive himself up. A really nice job like kind of sucking his hips into the wall because like the closer his hips are to the wall, the more you can just pull straight down. He doesn't have to pull himself in. And we can see kind of this almost this twist lock kind of side step technique. So he's getting opposite posed. He's got his left hand on, his right foot on. You can see his right knee is up into the wall. You could probably twist it even slightly more. But he looks super stable in this position. He's able to kind of rotate into this, you know, his forearm and bicep and twist himself in. That's going to really stabilize his arm that he's pulling from. And he sticks this left foot out up here and it kind of posts against the wall and stays rigid. And that's able to really balance and keep a lot of tension. That kind of lets him just free up that right hand to kind of just casually go up, up top here.

So here, I think he has to remember that he is part of this dance and it looks like they're doing two very different things. So it's kind of hard to judge because they're not on the same on the same page as far as the movement. So it really does help with this choreography if they are at least doing similar movements because his energy is different, his timing is different, his steps are different, so it's it's really hard to get how they're supposed to actually work together. So here, I think if they really trusted each other, definitely hold hands really tight here. And I think she could lean back even further in this step, and it would have really made a nice effect. And just kind of doing something different. But definitely want to have that level of trust to where she can just fall all the way out to the side and he hold on to her. So here I think it would have made more sense if he used his left hand to pull her just because she did like an extra turn and spin around which really wasn't necessary. He also needs to continue moving in the rock step triple step formation with his feet because he's just kind of stepping side to side and she's doing all the work. I also noticed as far as like eye contact with partnering, that's going to be really important. So his, he should always be kind of locked in on her and she on him. So that way they are constantly moving together in sync. So here as they circle around, he's like doing a pivot on his left leg. So that means his left leg is like staying in place while his right leg moves. And he should actually be stepping with both feet and she should be following his steps. So if his left foot moves and her right foot moves, and if his right foot is moving, then her left foot should move along with him. So they're moving more in tandem together. So here when she steps out, I think she can open up her shoulder out more so that way, just open this whole part out and bring it out as similar to how he's stepping out, just because her body is still facing him, and it just doesn't really get the correct effect for this movement. So here, she did the rock step and then she does the triple step and he's just kind of stepping around. So he definitely needs to match her steps so then that way they're going at the same pace. So here when he pulls her in, it's a little aggressive, so just be careful not pulling so hard. It should be a much smoother pull and less of him actually yanking her forward. I think for this whole sequence, if they like increase their energy a bit, I think it could definitely help. Their movements are just really slow, so I think if they really increase the rhythm, especially for this like swing style, where it should look like he's swinging her all over the place, but there is a level of energy that is needed to keep the movement and momentum going. So here the dancers are starting just stepping side to side together. Her hand is placed on his shoulder and his hand is placed right at her waist. So that is correct. They can probably lift up their elbows just a little bit to give a little space between. And they're also holding hands with their opposite hands together. So here into the turn, if she would have like really leaned out to the side and then he pull her in using that energy and force I think would have made it much easier for her to come into this position and spin around because she would have had the momentum to get up from the pool and then do a nice spin around. So here with the hands, they get a little lazy with them, so you want to make sure to keep the strength in the hands anytime they connect together. So these hands should really be about to here, just so they're not falling so low by the wayside. So that was a good section. Everything was pretty clean and smooth as far as him turning her out. I would definitely say try to step a bit lighter on their feet because they're a little loud. And that could mean just going up on the balls of her feet and his feet and then also bending the knees a little bit more just so there's a little more bounce and lightness to the movement. So overall, I definitely think increase the energy and then just try to be lighter on their toes. So really using the balls of the feet and the knees to swing around, trusting each other as a partner, and then also making sure they're both doing the same steps. So here in the steps, I think they both need to determine what the choreography is. And I'm pretty sure it's a rock step, triple step. So they should both be doing the exact same step at the same time together. Even if he's pushing her out, like pulling her out to the side, they should still be doing the exact same steps to keep the rhythm. So with the opposite hand, definitely this hand can go up just a little bit more so it's not so low by their waist and really like holding and securing. He should be holding and cupping her hand in his hand.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This one, the climber would have to engage the core to keep the feet from touching the ground and potentially try to extend the arm in the moment the hand is placed. Here the climber has brought the left foot to go up with a dynamic movement being super explosive once coming out from the low squat and releases the right hand making its way to the dyno move. Here we can see how the climber has made the placement of the right foot at a higher stance. And the left foot is on an open stance, meaning that the foot is far out to the left. And as the climber is pressing down on the toes, it's driving the weight of his body left to right. So when the climber is standing up to the, moving the body out right, it's creating more pressure on the right foot. And when the climber swings back, leaning back to the left position, then he's creating force onto the left foot. In this moment, the climber is creating a rocking moment where he drives his weight over left to right. And this is so that the climber can generate momentum when going for the stance up to the next hold. Here the climber got to swing out far due to the generated power from the explosive dynamic move up to the hold. And so the swing was so far out of the wall that the climber got to touch the feet down on the ground and the climber was not able to anymore apply pressure onto the hold. Here it seems as the climber has touched the ground before fully engaging onto the grip and let go of the grip due to the far swing that the climber has created. The climber was not able to hold on to the grip forcefully or bring their body up to avoid holding touching the ground. Here we can see the climber chalking up. This will help the climber to have better performance when on the wall and holding better onto the grips. Also it will help the climber dry up any sweat that may be coming from his hands. And as we see the climber is also rubbing the palms together to then take off any excess chalk that is on the palms. As we can see in this moment, as the climber is reaching up for the move, this one, already the climber going past the hold, meaning that the climber has generated a lot of power for the reach, has also stretched out the left leg to help the climber drive up to the momentum of the climber making the reach when standing up. At the same time, we can see how the left hand has left, so the power that needed to be generated from the wall down at the bottom on the lowest quad, the climber needed to generate a lot of power and leave all of their limbs and letting the right hand be the one landing, trying to lock off to that move. Here we can see the climber locating his body as low as possible with arms extended. This is because the climber needs to pendulum out from the move and does this by keeping the power of the left leg first to take place. Then once the climber gets to move out right, the climber then can transfer the weight and power of the stance over to the right foot. Here we can see the climber starting at a two hold start. This one are both doughnuts and the climber is holding it with all of the grip meaning that the thumb is underneath and that's going to be the one generating power for keeping the hand in place. The climber can do this comfortably as the climber is able to lean back. By leaning back the climber is creating more pressure at the grips. Also once the feet are positioned up in the wall then the climber starts.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This is a great position for his elbow to be as he releases the ball. As the elbow is above his eye level, that creates the good arc on the ball and for it to go into the basket. We take a look at the shooter's shooting hand or his right hand. He does a great job of snapping his wrist and giving a nice follow through and allowing, by him snapping his wrist and allowing the ball to roll off his fingertips, he creates great backspin on the ball and the ball is spinning towards the basket with backspin. So we want to make sure that we have this good follow through with our shooting hand and snapping the wrist and from this view you can see the back of his hand, back of his right hand so that lets you know that he did a great job of snapping his wrist, follow throughing with the shot and creating that backspin on the ball. As the shooter raises the ball above his head and is in the process of releasing the ball towards the basket, he slightly turns his wrist, he slightly turns his right wrist, and now that slight turn puts his hand, his right hand, in the correct position underneath the ball. And now he's able to have the ball nice in his dominant right shooting hand, and perfectly underneath the ball and centered underneath the ball in order to release the shot. At the same time, he begins, as the ball is moving towards the basket, he begins to move his left hand away from the ball, from behind the ball, opening that hand up and then clearing the path for the ball to shoot to the basket. So the ending of his shot, he gets to the correct position. Ideally, we would like for him to have this positioning with his left hand and his right guy, his right guy hand, excuse me, with his right shooting hand and his left guy hand. With this ending position that he is right now, we would ideally would like to have his hand in that position as he's raising the ball up from here upward into the correct position. His hand should already be in this correct position. But he's able to make a good amount of shots because the end point of his release is the correct position. We take a look at the shooter's placement of his feet. You can see that his right foot is slightly in front of his left foot. By his right foot being slightly in front of his left foot, that allows for his elbow to be lined up with the front of the rim. And with the elbow lined up with the front of the rim, it guarantees that our shot is gonna go straight into the direction of our release and towards our intended target. As the shooter brings the ball up, you can see his right hand is on the side of the ball, on the right side of the ball. His left hand is on the upper left portion of the ball, but more behind the ball. Ideally, we want this left hand to be on the side of the ball as he's raising the ball up, putting it into the shooting position above his head and goes into the shot. We want that hand more on the side and positioning that right hand more over to the left side to more in this middle portion of the ball. You see his right index finger is in the correct position as it's in the middle of the ball, but it's on the middle of the ball, but on the right side, on the outside portion of the ball. Here you can see he catches the ball and he takes his first step with his left foot. As a right-handed shooter, if I want to create momentum for my shot and create a good momentum and a good rhythm into my shot, I want to catch the ball and step with that left foot as I'm catching the ball and then I take my right foot and swing it into position and step into the correct position to go up into my shot. Right-handed shooter does a great job of using the proper footwork to step into his shot, creating the momentum and the rhythm to where he can go into his shot and it feels comfortable and natural and go up and release the shot. We take a look at the shooter's guide hand. His guide hand is in the perfect position as his hand is open and the palm is directly facing the direction of his release hand. His wrist isn't turned on that left hand to where his palm is facing downward to the ground or is actually pointing at the rim. The palm is facing directly to the right. So this is the perfect position for the palm to be facing. Now as you see his fingers on his guide hand are actually pointing towards the rim. So as he releases the ball his fingers on his guide hand go towards the direction of the basket. That is perfectly fine. This is something that is based off the shooter's comfort level. So his fingers on his left guide hand can be on the release pointing towards the basket like the shooter's is or it can be his fingers pointing straight up and down on the release. Whatever is most comfortable for the shooter. But as long as the palm is open and facing directly to the right that is a great position for the guide hand.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She would also benefit in finding some clarity in the undulation of her pelvis, her shoulders, her upper body, and her arms. As the dancer performs this kind of circular isolation of her shoulders, she's having a lot of nice clarity in the movement of the shoulders, though she could always move them a little bit more. She also has a lot of nice clarity in the inclusion of the arms choreographically.

So see how the ball's kind of falling behind his fingers? Again, it's slipping as it comes out of the hand. Therefore, it's kind of going to, where it wants to go, may be thrown off. We need to use this other non-shooting hand to help balance our body as we lift it up. Again, he just lets the ball kind of drop into his hands. He does keep his eyes up. I do give him that, but ideally we want to move from side to side and flow and have rhythm. It's also a rebound and drill as we move to shoot the ball on each side of the basket. Again, puts it in the palm of that hand, brings it down really low, easily a turnover. While the weight sort of shifts to that left foot, we want to step through on the right foot and pull the left knee up. We need to really utilize the non-shooting hand to help support and balance the basketball prior to the shot. So see how he just sits the ball in the left palm, here's the right arm, no use of the feet to help lift and elevate him up. He's just kind of trying to hook it up over the backboard. Not a lot of, I don't know, not a lot of control in that. It's just again, just the ball's just loosely sitting there and not ideal. Here's how you just kind of lifts it up because the ball's sitting on the palm. We need to get this guide hand on and really step through with that left foot and pull that right knee up. Here again, he just kind of flicks it up, standing underneath the net. Not real good spacing and angle here. This is a really tough shot to make. Here's the shot, he kind of flicks it up. I mean, it may go in, but the percentage is not real high. Again, he's standing flat-footed under the net, and that's a tough place to be in, like a rebound. This is not where you want to be. You want to be out, you know, out from the basket in order to play it out. Here again it sits on the palm of that right hand. Just a lot of control, support for shooting the basketball. Here's flat-footed. He does have his eyes up, but it's tough. It's tough to shoot when you're underneath the basket. Not an ideal fundamental shot. Here the shooter is attempting to perform or execute the Mike and drill. Ideally, you know, on the left side on the Mike and you want the shooter to step through on the right foot here and pull the left leg up. He's choosing just to stand, stand under the net and just stand and shoot the basketball. He's totally just using his left hand. No little use of the right or the non-shooting hand on this side. I, you know, ideally we want that footwork to lift and elevate around the basket to be able to go up over a defender and then you want the right hand, you know, to help get the ball up to the shot so you could be strong with it as you go up. Here, just very vulnerable position to be in. The ball just sitting on one hand. He's got the right angle here but probably not a lot of control just coming out of the palm of that left hand. Again, not ideal. Two hands on the basketball as we lift the ball up to shoot it. We want to go off this left foot. We don't want to just lean onto the right foot. We want to step through with this left foot, have better timing and rhythm for the mic. Here's the lift. Again, a defender can just knock that out of his hand. The ball is probably wobbling as it comes out. Here it is. See how it's sitting on the palm of his hand? He's just kind of scooping it up. You want that shooting hand behind the ball and the guide hand to help lift it up there. Again, very little use of the footwork and legs for the Mike and drill. Here, he missed the ball, just comes right back down. He doesn't even move his feet to go get the ball. So, not ideal. You know, you've got to... This drill is about footwork and timing and rhythm and flow from side to side. Here, he's just standing and waiting for the ball to come down. He does keep his eyes up. But basically, he's just shooting this lifting hook shot, which is not a real fundamental type of shot. Here, you know, he doesn't even move. You know, execution-wise, the footwork is something he needs to be taught or do without a ball or without a shot. Again, he just stands here. So here, you need to, ideally, you want to step through on the left foot and pull the right knee up. And again, see how he just has the ball sitting on the palm of that right hand. The off-arm is just not being used at all. Again, the ball's in a very vulnerable position here. It's not stable. It's not balanced. It's gonna come out of the fingertips and just move too much and it'll throw off the accuracy of it. It's hard to do. And you know, here, it's just the spacing to shoot is not real well.

Sometimes it is more efficient to just go fast and jump, but on the backswing the climber loses tension through the left hand and pops off that jug, which is pretty common with moves like this. The climber would just need to jump a little bit higher in order to be in a lock off, more of a lock off, to really reel in this jump. Here we have the climber starting matched on this two-foot rail with a left hand heel This is a very good heel hook. We'd call this like a bucket heel hook It's really easy to initiate the hips with a heel hook that is this good Climber then goes left hand to this puffy pinch here, switches the feet, drops the knee in and flags the left foot out, locks the left arm down and is able to go up and right into this pinch here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And so for B major, you're going to want 1, 2, 3, and instead of tucking, because then your thumb would have to come all the way up here to the F sharp, you would want to play that 4 with that stretch, or to the F natural, and then it just gives you some more space to kind of play through the rest of those pitches in the scale. Okay, and now she's playing Her fingers are pretty flat You can tell just by evidence of the video that you know She's feeling anxious and feeling a bit stressed which Tends to bring out some of those bad habits as we're playing and so just really taking a deep breath Focusing curling up those fingers and taking it slow one hand at a time Okay, in this section, so I would really draw the pianist's attention to the fingering. So those are written in there for you to kind of help with those turns as you go up and down the scales. With the C scale and the G scale, she is playing a 1 2 3 4 and then tucking her thumb under and you want that to be a 1 2 3 and then turn, which allows you to have that finger pattern so that you're not twisting and trying to find those pitches. So, right there the pianist did make it through the scale, however, the finger shifted and so we did not end in the right finger pattern, but she was able to play the whole scale up and down. Okay, so this is something that I think is really common with beginning inexperienced pianists is that, yes, it is about playing right notes, but it's also about our technique and the way that we play, and the way that we hold our hands, and the fingerings that we use are just as important as playing right notes. And so it doesn't do anyone any good to, you know, kind of plow through and make it as fast as possible if you have so many incorrect notes that you have to keep restarting over and over again. So just really breaking that down, working through it slowly, really working on that technique and that hand position, and the pattern, because the major scale pattern is whole whole half whole whole whole half. And so even without looking at the notes on the music, you can you can see that pattern between whole steps and half steps, which will help you to know where those sharps and flats are and where you need to turn your fingers. Great, and that pattern was much better. Additionally, I would still highly recommend working hands alone, taking your time, and going slow and setting the metronome. Great, so that time she did she did that tuck after number three and you can see how the pattern worked with her fingers Okay, the piano starts with a good posture and hand position in relation to the piano. So you can see here So after she plays with that third finger That's where she wants to tuck that thumb. And so it gets a little bit tricky as she as she puts her fourth and fifth finger down and then She doesn't have anywhere to go. And so if we tuck that one two three and put that thumb on the G then she plays up with the G ABC D and then she comes down five four three two one and then crosses again and that third finger goes back to the F-sharp Okay, so for this exercise, it's actually designed, she's trying to play it with just her left hand, and it is designed for right and left hand combined. And so this would be, again, an opportunity to just take that slower and really work out those notes. Okay, the pianist is starting with scales and The music that she is looking at is actually a two octave scale and she's just playing one octave which is fine She Is struggling with the fingering so she's it this is Probably not as familiar with this. I Would recommend working Exclusively hands alone until you get those finger patterns in And secure the other thing that can be helpful when working on scales because as the right hand is ascending It's the same finger pattern as when the left hand is descending and so you can start on opposite like on a C an octave apart with thumbs and So you can practice those fingerings with the same pattern and so as the left hand is going down the right hand is going up But then the fingers are moving in the same fashion And that is really helpful as you're beginning to work on scales", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

But then she kind of gets this idea to go up with the left hand and while it doesn't work, that aspect of, you know, if you try something a couple of times and it just doesn't work, you know, try to do either you got to try harder or try something new. And so she tries something new and she kind of fails. But I think it kind of unlocks something. So she's able to see kind of like there is potentially a different sequence there.

It does look like his pan's not tremendously hot at this point because his egg's not turning lighter color. On the edges, that's the first indication of cooking through. incorporates those with his onion. And here you can see he's actually moving the cutting board with his left hand to accommodate the knife. That's not how you want to do this, but he's also seated which is a very unusual way to go about cutting things. So he's kind of making this his own. I would say that's going to keep him at a low level of proficiency. You want to kind of figure out how to do things the right way so that you can improve your skill set. He could do a little bit more to get more air in by lifting that egg mixture up, but he is doing a fairly good job So here he's used the side of his fork to break the eggshell over the bowl. It's a great clean way to break an eggshell, get a handhold with thumbs and keep any egg residue from getting on a countertop or another surface when you've used that as your breaking medium. Even though it's a nonstick skillet, you still want to add oil to the pan. The nonstick surface can be marred and sometimes that causes sticking, but typically an omelet, especially because eggs are so sticky, just is better if you can put a little oil in that pan. Here just randomly rocking over the onion. We'll get it cut down. You see he's getting nice small pieces. It's just very haphazard. And here he's just making random cuts on it. His cutting board is slipping. He needs to anchor it to his table with a damp towel or some sort of thin rag or something that'll just kind of make a barrier that it doesn't slip. Again, pressing on it, that's going to make it a dense texture, which you don't want. He takes a small nonstick skillet and he adds it to his stove. He does another stir. And here he's turned his omelet. This here could also be cumin. That's another savory spice that's used frequently. Now from this angle you can see it's lightening up a bit. He's adding some additional spices. I cannot see what they are, but in this kind of omelet, which is typically considered a masala omelet, it's not a French omelet. There are lots of spices that in the Indian culture they will use, including cumin, coriander, sometimes a curry powder of some sort, a garam masala blend. They could use turmeric, they could use ginger or garlic paste. So there's just a lot of options here, but he is creating layers of flavor by adding his own spices. He's tilting the pan to make the oil coat the base of the pan fully. He's taken a handful to his cutting board. Using his fingers he's adding a pinch of salt to the mixture. Test his pan again with his hand to see if it's warm. Here he's using his hand to gauge how warm his pan is. He's holding it above so he can feel the radiating heat to decide whether it's hot enough to add his egg mixture yet. This particular spatula has got these holes in it as you can see, and it's called a fish turner. It's kind of got a longer surface than most spatulas which typically come in wider. So it's going to be perfectly fine for what he's doing, but it is called a fish turner. He's washing his hands before he begins, which is always a great thing to do. And he adds that to his bowl of egg. and then making small cuts to get like a little dice on a few pieces. And he's attempting to roll it, to do another fold on it. It's just not wanting to budge. And here you add some oil to the pan. He has a bowl of already slivered onions or sliced. And here he's got some form of chili powder, it looks like. And he adds a bit of fresh ground black pepper to the top. Quickly stir this mixture again Here he's using his fork to whisk the egg. That's a great thing to use because you want to incorporate air while also making sure that the egg white and egg yolk fully integrate. Turns on his heat At this point, this egg is completely cooked through and can be served. He's just extra cooking it, which may be his taste. You set up a cutting board and a small chef's knife. And now he adds the egg mixture to the pan.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

This right foot, left foot is just trying to stay on it as much as possible. You can see he's kind of dropping into the right, but nothing's really pushing him up the wall. Everything's just kind of staying tensioned. And if he's going to stay tensioned, I think this is where the heel hook comes into play and really utilizing that heel hook to suck his hips in and really pull his body and keep it tight against the wall. So from the get-go it seems like he's keeping his arms straight but he's moving a little fast and sporadic. It's causing his feet to kind of cut off the wall and swing himself out. So he kind of seems constantly at odds of moving fast up the wall but then also fighting this kind of swing and this kind of sloppy, un-tensioned look in his feet. Now here he's kind of unsure. You can see him kind of swapping his feet back and forth as he tries to figure out what hand he's gonna go up to this. This one with the ends up bumping it, but the foot that he's on isn't really, it's kind of sloping on top, it's an undercling. So the positive side is on the bottom side and the left side. So here's where a kind of heel hook would be nice because he could kind of heel hook in, you know, draw his hips close to the wall and have this right foot kind of flaking out underneath him. And that would keep him really close to the wall on all these kind of poor holds. But especially on this big pinch slopey thing, you can see how kind of geometric and flat it is. When he hits it, he'd be directly kind of underneath it and be able to just pull through it and really utilize this friction. Whereas when he kind of goes for it now, his feet are kind of causing him to be so far out from the wall that when he hits this hold, he's having to really pinch and kind of pull in and drive in.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

As the climber was engaging on making a close grip at the purple block, the climber was also sustaining the green pinch which the climber kept trying to bring the elbow down to stay close to the wall and as well as him creating body positioning that would make him be underneath the purple hold. This was difficult and the climbers right foot has then come out of place making it impossible for the climber to pull on such holds. If the climber was going to do this again it's important that he finds quickly the next foot positioning as this may not be the best area where the climber can sustain the grips for a long time. Since the climber has reached the purple grip, the climber slaps the hold and tries to create friction by leaning on the hold, staying under it and keeping the elbow close to the wall. This is important because the climber is creating friction with an open grip but catches the grip at the corner of the hold. Now that the climber has reached the hold, he needed to release the pressure done by the left toe so that the climber is able to gain position to stay under it and swing him back to apply the right force instead of being away from the hold. As the climber released the left hand to make a placement to match the right hand hold, we can see how the climber's left foot has come off the foot placement. This, if the climber gets to sustain the grip, he will need to apply core pressure to not allow the feet to touch the floor. In this case, the climber will create enough pressure at the grip and has to bring his feet up back into the wall. This would be called cutting feet if it was done with control, but in this case the climber's left foot has slipped off from the wall. Here we can see the climber bringing his right toe to be placed above the left hand initials hold. This one the climber is creating pressure by pushing down on the hold with the right toe and the climber continues to pull the hand upwards towards the climber in a way of the wall in order to sustain pressure. Once the climber gets to apply pressure on the foot and then the climber will be able to release the lift hand grip. As the climber was making his way on the swing out to be underneath the hold where the hand was placed, the climber has lost the center of gravity, this time because he was too far away from the wall. Potentially a lack of pressure on the foot being placed, which was the right foot, and then the left hand grip has given out the moment that the right foot has dropped. This made it impossible for the right hand to stay on the purple hold. Here the climber continues to apply pressure on the grip, this one being the pinch, and is bringing himself close to the wall. To gain height, the climber is pushing down on the right foot as he is extending his leg, which initially he had brought his knee inwards to keep his position right side against the wall, which will help the climber keep closeness when making the reach, which will be efficient for the climber. As we can see, the left leg has gone out into an extension and pointed out. This is called flagging out, which helps the climber stay balanced while pressing on the right foot. As we can see also, the toe is being pressed against the wall, and this is to support the climber having three points of contact on the wall to maintain position once reaching a certain height, and this to stabilize the climber to have more control when reaching the grip. This flag also helps the climber to keep his right side against the wall as he will be pressing on the leg, keeping tension, and driving his hip against the wall and staying in that position. It's important the climber glances down at the feet, especially when switching down on a foot chip, which is a small hold, in order to apply the right pressure when doing the switch of foot placement. In this case, the climber will have to continue to apply pressure at the grips, and that to release some pressure down at the feet. However, the feet will have to continue to have contact with the foot chip so that the climber doesn't slip away from the hold. As we can see, the right foot has come to be positioned onto the hold first, this one being the toe, for the left toe to then be released, which he will have to do by rolling it out of the foot chip. The climber is making some hand gestures with his hands. This will help the climber to visualize the sequence before getting onto the wall, as each hold would pertain for each hand to be held at a certain way, as well as having to have an order for each hand to go over the other. The climber was able to recover getting his feet back in the wall and places them at a high stance. Quickly engaging force on the feet by pressing down the climber was able to bring his squat to an open stance to drive his hips in when making the pull quickly to the next hold. This left hand seems to be a pinch so the climber will need to drive force from the thumb to continue to sustain the grip. In this case, the climber needed to bring his feet up to benefit from moving up the sequence of holds coming ahead. So as we can see, the climber has a match of three limbs in one hold. This one because the climber will be needing to release the right foot out of the hold and instead the climber is bringing the left toe to be placed above the hold. This will help the climber to keep his hips square once releasing the right foot. And once the climber applies pressure on that left toe, then the climber's left hand will be able to come out of place. Here the climber is starting at a two hand hold start. As we can see the top hold, the climber will need to create pressure by pushing on the hold and staying under it as it's on a rail. So the left hand on the other hand is placed under and by the hip of the climber. So past the hip of the climber actually. So this is called an undercling and the climber is placing the fingers underneath the hold and it seems to be like a jug, meaning that it's a positive hold. But in order to sustain that grip, the climber will have to pull it towards him. This type of pulling, this is called a compression. So in order to stay in place, the climber will need to keep the arms extended once placing the feet. The climber will then start the climb until the feet are off the ground.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The dancer could move a little bit more fluid if there was more arch in the back when the dancer was dancing here. So we have this effect more. And if the arms were flowing a little bit more away from the body rather than at this angle and pressed against the torso. The move right there is actually in the shoulders, not in the hands. It shouldn't be the hands moving like that, where it looks like they are beating on a drum. It should really be the shimmying in the shoulders, where the shoulders are moving forward and forward, alternating, and up and down.

However, they would really benefit from dropping that pelvis back so that they're more grounded and they're able to activate the appropriate range of motion for this movement, which I believe should come from kind of this forward and backwards hinge of the upper body instead of this kind of circular motion that they're activating in their chest and shoulders. Overall, they need to bring their pelvis into the conversation of the movement, which would be welcomed by a deeper grounding. As the dancer begins with the basic salsa step, right away they demonstrate that they have an understanding of the movement vocabulary and technique here. They're incorporating their arms in a way that's choreographically appropriate, clear, and appears natural and like they're at ease as they're doing so. They've also got a fair amount of movement through their torso and their pelvis, which is helping to kind of continue to maintain that rhythmic embodiment. And have some nice clarity in their footwork as well. Overall, they demonstrate that they're familiar with the movement technique and able to execute rhythmic embodiment. As the dancer performs this ball change moving backwards into the space, they lose the clarity that they had in their footwork before. They would really benefit from clarifying the ball change of the feet, as well as bending the knees and dropping the pelvis not only back, but also out so that it pulls them in this direction that they're moving behind themselves. They would also benefit from finding some dynamic clarity of the arms here. They've got a fairly clear shape. However, just some refinement of that dynamic would be great. As the dancer performs some quicker movements, they would really benefit from grounding and bending their knees, dropping their pelvis a bit more here, which would help them move more quickly and efficiently in moments where the tempo is a bit quicker. They would also really benefit from grounding to activate a greater range of motion from the top of their head through their spine and down to their pelvis in this body roll, where they're only activating kind of their mid torso, leaving out their pelvis and their head from this body roll, which is really cutting their movement short and overall appears a bit awkward and clunky. They would also benefit from some more clarity in the shaping of the arms here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So the climber is bringing the toe in and once the climber turns his knee to come into the wall, then he will be pressing the hold away in order to create pressure. The climber chooses to drop the feet out of the foot placement and to bring his center of gravity to be hanging low to transfer over the weight to the grips. The climber makes a transition of the right foot from being extended out to come at a high foot placement in front of him While continuing to lock off with the right hand close to his chest And is also not only able to sustain his weight with the right hand But also with the left grip that is at this end since he has already dropped the weight onto the grip by extending the arm At this reach of the climber sending the left hand over to the hold, he sustains it as a pinch. Since the climber is sending over the thumb onto the other side, in order to sustain the grip, he must squeeze onto the hold. Immediately after securing the grip, he immediately drops the weight. The climber is only using two places of contact as his areas of support. The left hand sustaining onto the grip with the arms extended while pressing onto the right toe to create pressure to sustain himself in place. The climber has dropped the left foot being on a flag so that the climber can stay steady on his center of gravity being close to the wall as he made the transition of the right hand coming out from the pinch to fully be arched over his head to make the right hand placement over to his left side. Now his right hand is coming into place to a large lip ridges of the hold. The climber making the first move out of the start, he sends the left hand up inside of the hold. This one has a small edge and is sharp so the climber places his fingers behind the edge of the hold. As we can see, his body movement in order to make the reach, he has pushed off on the left foot and has sent the left foot extended due to committing to a dynamic reach. At this view we can see the climber starting at a two hand hold start. The right hand he's sustaining to a block which he will have to create pressure by squeezing onto the sides of the hold. The reason why the climber brings the thumb over to the other side. For the left hand we can see the climber sustaining to a much smaller hold. This one the climber will place the fingertips above the top edge of the hold. Since this is small the climber will have to engage a lot of power onto the top fingers where the knuckles will be sticking out. He will have to bring the palm into the hold in order to keep the hand in place. When the climber makes a series of moves without using the feet and the feet are on space, this is called campusing as he uses momentum and upper body force in order to sustain the holds throughout the moves. The climber must sustain the grips tight even if having the arms extended. This is because the climber will be performing a foot switch. The type of foot switch that the climber is doing is called a magic carpet, where he sends the left toe above the right toe, this one one shoe over the other, and the climber is slightly moving back the right foot, that is the one right now being in contact with the hold. It's important that the climber, when doing this foot switch, he does not lose contact of the foot placement, as it will overcompensate the grips. So the climber, as making a space of smearing the foot back to give space at the front of the toe, he then is able to place the very top edge of the left toe to press into the hold, and as soon as the climber has that type of contact, he will then quickly release the right foot out of its place to then the climber drop the left heel to have a surface of the toe with the hold. The climber once applying pressure into the high foot placement, being in the small foot chip, he releases the left foot from its place and extends the leg. This is called flagging out and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place. Now the climber is glancing to a hold of distance, which he will need to commit into a dynamic move and sustain onto the areas of support being the left hand and the right foot placement tightly as he gets to balance the leg to balance the move. We can see how the climber brought the right hand to come into a match at the same hold. Matching is when both of the limbs are in the same hold and he brings the fingers to be placed flat on top of the edge of the hold. Now the climber must continue to sustain the grip by placing weight onto it. The reason why the climber is engaging to a pull up to bring the elbows close to the wall to transfer over the weight to the grips. The climber continues to keep the arms bended while making this right foot placement. He has only used the right foot placement to stabilize himself from swinging and have a slight boost so that the climber can secure making the left hand up to be transitioned to the holder reach. As we can see the climber continues to have the pull up while sustaining onto the grips. This way he is not dropping off his weight yet. If he does do drop the weight, it will be difficult for the climber as he would have to release and then again engage on the arms taking more energy out of the climber. And he said the climber has looked around so that he can make a foot placement in this instance. So he brings the right foot into a high foot placement and once securing the foot then the climber will be able to drop the weight on the grips. It's important to know that when the climber performs campusing, to only do it when there is good holds, as campusing over small holds or holds that are rounded or with small edges will not work as great as the climber will compromise the movement in his climb. We can see the climber dropping his center of gravity away from the wall by continuing to sustain to the grips in the left foot that he just made a placement to. This to bring the right foot into a high foot placement next to his right hand, bringing the foot to be placed inside on top of the foot chip. This one because it's the small hole that the climber had used for his left hand before placing the top edge of the toe to press against the hold. Now the climber must sustain to the grips tightly once he gets to apply force into that toe placement in order to make the next move. The climber had extended the arms before performing this move. So once he was ready, he engaged on a forceful pull-up, pulling both of the grips down in order to gain height to release the right hand from its placement. The climber doing a kick back helps the climber to gain even more height so that he has more time to transition his right hand over to the next hand placement. The climber is chucking up his hands as he's placing his hands inside of a bucket. Where as a big pouch in the climber, in chucking up the hands, will be chucking the palms in order to gain a better grip when sustaining onto the wall, as well as absorbing any sweat that may be coming from his hands. The climber right now is fully extended horizontally so he's sending the left foot that was out on a flag to come into place at the same hold where the right foot is coming to a match. Except that the right foot is placed inside of the hold while he's placing the left toe on the outer side of the hold. This one because it has a hole inside of the hold. Once the climber gets to create pressure onto that left toe coming into place he will be able to release the right foot from the hold. We can see the climber, once creating pressure of the right foot coming into place, he was able to release the left foot. So the climber is able to use it as a flag, which means that he will transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place, and the left leg being extended as a flag will help the climber to maintain balance over the moves. The climber has reached the last hold coming into a match. Now the climber, while matching the hold and sustaining his position, he must demonstrate controlling his stability in order to complete the climb. The climber then is glancing down at the feet and it's important that he always glances down at the feet especially when making a foot switch. The climber right now is holding on tight onto the grip so release some of the pressure down at the feet but the climber needs to continue to create pressure down at the feet to not lose its foot placement. When the climber gets to apply pressure of the left toe onto the hold then he will be able to release the right foot from its place. The climber takes advantage of the momentum to transfer over to the left side of the wall. In this one, the climber had brought the right hand up into a jog and quickly brings the transition of the left hand to the next grip being a pinch hold. As we can see, the climber continues to pick up his weight by tensing on the body and this time picking up the feet. Once the climber gets to secure the grips, he could continue to do one more pull by extending the arm or drop the weight at the positive grips that he's at. The climb will start once the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing on the mat. This is a step up start. So the climber once places the feet onto the wall, he will be able to raise the hips by pressing on the feet and transferring over the weight to the grips by leaning back. We can see how the climber continuously throughout a series of moves have kept the left leg extended. This is called flagging out and helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place, as well as keeping his side towards the wall when making the reach. In this case, it's important that the climber keeps his left side towards the wall as it assures the climber to bring his center of gravity close. Dropping the feet can also help the climber to maintain balance and stability over the performance of moves. The claim of making some hand gestures is for him to visualize the movements he must perform when on the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This hold I think is a lot more in-cut here, but pretty nice body position. Drop knee into the right, right hip into the wall, left foot flagging out, and just locking down this left hand and getting this right hand super good. So here I have the climber mid-move attempting to jump for this jug. And the climber initiates the movement by kind of doing one of these things. So basically they sway their hip left, right, and then left. I think this is one of those situations where the move is a bit more direct. So instead of swinging the hips, the climber really just needs to lock this right hand down super hard and jump straight up in order to gain this jug. Because as you sway your hips, you end up going away from the wall. Your momentum takes you that way. And when you jump with a lateral momentum, you end up falling away from the wall faster. And so this move just doesn't have quite enough punch for this climber.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Now it's all a matter of the climber is squeezing onto the hold in order to support the grips. This is because the climber has brought the left hand to come into support when the center of gravity already is past being lined up underneath the right hand. So the climber as he continues to go out in the swing, he will need to tighten up the core in order to do body tension which also involves in the climber to bend the arms and the pull up to avoid himself from swinging completely and peeling off the hold. We can see here how the climber has engaged on the right foot placement and is no longer on the foothold. This helped the climber when on the push to gain direction over to the right. And now that the climber is gaining some height onto this jump, he is forcing himself into the wall by pulling himself in on the grips. Once the climber starts gaining more height, he will have to press onto that right foot to boost the jump. As we can see, the climber was able to transfer over the weight to the grips by keeping the arms extended and holding tight onto the grips, especially with keeping the thumb on the outside of the hold, where the climber will be able to engage into a squeeze in order to give more extra gripping power. Now, the climber will be able to start the climb once his feet are no longer on the mat and they're on the wall. The left foot is placed onto a foot chip, this one being a lot smaller of a foot hold, and the climber's right foot is going to be placed onto a larger hold, where the climber will be able to place about half of the foot to surface against the hold. The climber has just slipped out of the placement. This was because when the climber had dropped the weight onto the grips it was held as a jug and jugs usually can be held at any direction. However, when he is completely swung over to the right side then that edge doesn't become necessarily a jug. It becomes a pinch grip so we'll have to involve the climber and adding extra gripping power in forcing the fingers towards each other on the force of the swing. It can be difficult so it's only a matter of time for the climber for his grips to give out and if there is any moisture build into the grip then the climber most likely will slip away from the hold. The climber has brought the left hand to come up for the support on a match of the jug. And this one, because it's a jug, it can be held at any direction and it all matters on the climber gripping power by squeezing onto the hold. However, the climber has already dropped the weight onto the right hand grip and just placed the left hand. So the climber is continuing to swing out. It's all a matter for the climber to have body tension in order to support the grips. So in this case, the climber not only needs to engage on gripping power, but also engage on a pull up slightly to pull himself in from completely peeling off from the move. Body tension means that the climber will also engage on core power by tining up while going out on the swing. the climber in boosting the jump while pressing on the right foot placement potentially took him off the wall as we can see he's been launched over and away from the wall. In this case it's important that the climber has secured the hand placement before he drops the weight onto the grip. Dropping on the weight of the grip will happen immediately as soon as the climber's center of gravity lines up underneath the right hand placement so it's important that the climber sense the left hand to come into support. The climber at this moment is chalking up and as a white powder that the climber will get to spread out onto his hands in order to gain a better grip when sustaining onto the holds as well. The chalk will help absorb any sweat that may be coming from his hands. The climber on the jump eventually will release all of the limbs from the wall. And this one is a fraction of a second where the climber is airborne and yet to apply the right hand placement onto the hold at reach. It's important that the climber as soon as has this feeling he brings the hand to be slapped over the hold in order to sustain the hand placement. Once the climber securing the grips and the foot placements, he lowers his center of gravity, this so that he has the feet at a high foot placement and extending the arms. At this moment, the climber is glancing at the hold of distance as he will need to commit into a dyno. A dyno means that it is a dyno, a dynamic move in which the climber will have to press down on the feet forcefully and bring his center of gravity close to the wall when performing to the jump. Here the climber is starting at a two hand hold start. Both of the holds are rounded with a hole inside of the hold. This is called a donut hold so the climber places the grips at the bottom edge of the hold. As the climber places the hands far in, there is a groove so that the climber is able to place the fingertips to curl them.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I'd love to see as she's circling with the ribs to make it a little bit more exaggerated, a little bit more articulated, just to make it look a little bit sharper, clearer, cleaner. I'd love to see her get to this shape a little bit more quickly, a little bit more of an attack, and hold the shape a little bit longer. She kind of falls out of it, or moves out of it a bit too quickly for it to read as a shape, and so we don't really get to enjoy the strength that she puts through the through the limbs here. Here she's preparing to do a turn. She did a great job bringing the arms in front of her body and then throwing them out and up and making these arcs with her arms. Nice straight elbows, great energy out the fingertips. I also like that she's on the balls of both of her feet and keeping her hips connected with one another, meaning facing the same direction as each other. That tells me that she's driving the movement from the pelvis and from the balls of the feet, which is the correct turn technique. My only qualm is that I wish that she would have prepared with her feet facing downstage before starting her turn. That would make the turn much sharper and stronger. Again I think some more attack with the arm would have made this step a bit more interesting. She's bringing the arm up and then around her body in a very smooth way. I think it would be much more effective if she brought her arm out quickly and then across her body so that we could get more of this shape rather than this sort of vague softer shape that she's making. She's doing a really good job of pivoting her feet here as she's turning to go back the other direction. You can see she's high up on the balls of her feet which is really nice. This is pretty strong for her here. So what she did was she turned to face upstage, put her weight on her left foot, and then swung her knee out and up into this shape here. She's pretty clear about the shape. I like that she's got it close to her body here. That makes it look, again, very clear. She's also lifting through the hip, which in this case kind of works for this shape. My issue is that she's kind of tilted her head or kept her head more perpendicular to the floor. So it kind of makes this disjointed shape and her arms are not helping her at all. So she kind of, her upper body really detracts from the strength of this movement. So I'd love to see her make some more clear shapes or movements with her arms and consider either not bringing this hip up or keeping it in line with her head or bringing the hip up and keeping the head more in this orientation with the rest of the spine. Pretty good shape here. So she did a little leap into here with this nice plie through the standing leg. Nice straight knee with the working leg here. Looks really strong. Also great strong arm with energy off the fingertips in the back as well as the front. Nice little twist here through the torso. It would just be a little clearer and crisper if there was more of a line this way from the fingers to the toes rather than this sort of curve. Here she's doing this step touch movement. She seems to understand the basic mechanics of it, but she's a little bit too stiff through the pelvis and shoulders here. This movement would be much stronger and more interesting if she could move her pelvis and or shoulders and not just bring her arm up and down as the only other movements that we can watch here. It'd be nice if she carried some polyrhythms with the pelvis here and exaggerated the movement. Also the arm never really fully get straightened, so I'd love to see more exaggeration and sharpness with that shape to just again make it look more crisp. She only really gets it this far out with this very bent elbow. She's a really great mover. She's right on the music. She's very well coordinated between her arms and her legs I would like to have seen her as she steps out for this drag step to be Actually more with the plie and a flat foot here and step a bit further away from her body So she could accentuate and exaggerate this drag moment The arms are really graceful and and nice I think this would be a bit more effective if she had a little bit more attack into making the shape with the arms rather Than bringing it up so gracefully actually Just because the music and that particular shape with the arm lend itself to a bit more Let lend themselves to a bit more attack and she kind of she kind of misses that she's choosing a more graceful routes And I just think aesthetically it doesn't quite work with this music This section she's just doing a basic step forward and back. She's doing a great job staying on the balls of her feet to keep the movement nice and light and smooth, but it kind of goes on for a while and she doesn't really change her arms and so it kind of starts to fizzle out and lose interest and she's even starting to seems to lose interest herself or get a little bit less confident here because she's gazing at the floor. Nice strength through the arm shape here as she's turning. Very graceful movement here. She's doing a step forward and back, a basic step. She's staying on the balls of her feet, which is what makes it look graceful and smooth. I'd love to see a bit more exaggeration with the arms, however, to just add a little bit of interest to this moment because she kind of keeps going back and forth in this repetition and so we need as viewers something a little bit more to latch on to. So I think something a bit more exaggerated and more clear shape-wise with the arms would be really helpful. She's doing a good job of continuing to move her arms in between the two drags that she's doing from side to side Which shows that yeah, she's moving through her transitions, which keeps this movement looking quite consistent and cohesive", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And so she remains at eye level looking there so that her body in turn finishes all of it completely facing where she began. This includes her, her head, her shoulders, her chest, her torso, her hips, her waist, her knees, her toes, everything ends up facing the direction where she started. The dancer is traveling perfectly just horizontally with this movement and in place. Although this movement could really look more like a triangle if she stepped out and then across and again out and across so that she would be traveling further forward with each step. And she could do that by starting further back in the room so that she has the room to travel forward. But even where she is, even if she started exactly where she is, she could cover ground. However, she's not covering any ground at all. The dancer just seems very contained. The steps that she's doing are executed correctly. She's doing the appropriate amount of steps. Going out one, two, and returning three. Going out five, six, returning seven. The steps are technically correct and she is on rhythm. However, everything just seems a bit perfect instead of performative. So she could add in some stylistic flares to give her movement some dynamics. The dancer doesn't conclude the dance completely. She steps a bit in place with small steps and then starts turning around. It would be better if she took ownership of this performance that she just had by standing still, making a pose, and facing straight forward so that there's a type of conclusion to this dance routine. The dancer starts this turn with a great spot forward. We see that her arm is extended in a straight line right in front of her and that her view is that arm. So she's looking straight ahead before she begins that turn. And that sets her up for success very well in terms of if her eyes continue on the path of where they are right now, she will be able to complete that turn exactly where she began it. Again, the dancer just seems very contained. Her arms are in a proper position here. They're purposely bent at the elbow and purposely bent at the wrist. There's a lot of care put in her steps, which is wonderful in terms of like she is executing everything very well, but it just seems contained that she is just placing her arms there instead of dancing and moving them there. So the dancer could use a bit more gas in her engine. The dancer's arms are very fluid here as she alternates one arm higher and lower. She could make this movement even larger and more exciting if she engages her shoulders while moving her arms so that her shoulders are also moving up and down and not just her arms moving up and down. The dancer travels a bit underneath herself when she goes backwards. Her steps both forwards and backwards should be equidistant and in general a dancer should just be moving more and traveling more to make her dancing more excited and grander and bigger. One idea what she can add something in would be shimmying her shoulders. Could be something she could do or she could also look in the direction that she steps out in and do that on each side. But just to engage more body parts so that not everything is so perfect and just so neat. The dancer could also make this movement more exciting by making it bigger in terms of bending her knees more so that she would have Just a change in level. Also, she wouldn't be completely At her fullest height she could change the dynamic by bending a little bit lower in between So that her dancing is not so monotone here", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I would encourage this dancer to really think about head placement and how can they incorporate their head and neck. They're doing a wonderful job of rotating their shoulders forward, up, and back and not looking at the ground, but thinking about creative ways to incorporate and show engagement in the head shows embodiment from head to toe even in basic choreography.

He can maybe go up in his toes just a little bit so his feet are not flat on the spin, but otherwise really nice job spinning around. So really nice personal touch and just seeing his personality kind of come through as he crosses his foot forward. His arm is kind of covering over his head and around the top of his head to back. And then using a little bit of the shoulder shrug to add a little extra detail. So really nice. Again, it is very simple. Just stepping, crossing over and stepping to the side, adding a little more personality to the movement. So from this angle, you're able to see his chest and his arms really add to the movement. His feet are really simple, so they're just staying, stepping in place. He is picking his feet up correctly, and his knees are nicely bent. But really nice just chest pops for this beginning movement. So in here he's just doing some toe taps forward. I do like that he is really pushing his chest to kind of pop forward and back. And he's adding just a little bit of thrusting in his hips as well just to kind of help with the chest to move. Nice job bending his knees and then staying up on his feet. So here he's stepping out to the side and he's kind of pushing his arm out just a little bit, but it's a little slower on the beat. So really nice contrast in his feet moving a little faster and his arm pushing out a little bit slower.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The dancer continues to look to the side of the room. It's very important, especially for when she's doing a turn or completing this revolution, that she looks forward so that she doesn't get dizzy and that she completes this change in direction neatly. Right now, she's leaving her shoulders open to the side of the room. Her hips are open also to the side of the room. And instead, all this should be facing directly to the front where the black curtain is facing in front of her. The dancers focus is off. She keeps looking to the side of the room Towards the mirror where perhaps the dancer Dancers choreographer teacher is standing for clues to the sequence. We see someone here might be also dancing with her But instead the dancer really needs to be looking straightforward This is changing her spine right now her cervical spine or her neck is turned to the side meanwhile It's also opening up her shoulders and her chest a bit to the side and her shoulders should be both squared off To the front of the room her chest should be completely straight straight to the front of the room this just allows the possibility of also her hips turning to the side and just Changing the alignment of her spine The dancer now is stepping underneath herself and not traveling at all. She's reaching the end of the routine but she doesn't gain speed or traction or energy. She's just stepping in place. This seems very casual, nonchalant. She really should be executing this basic salsa steps, forward and backwards and back to the center. So she ends the routine strongly. Right now she's just giving up and dissipating her energy. The dancer once again forgets the sequence, so now she's stepping in place instead of doing the next salsa steps, which should be a box step around in a square. Again, the dancer is looking towards the side of the room because this set of dance steps is about to end and she's about to go into a different set of dance steps and she's looking for a clue as to what that next set is. The dancer really needs to memorize this routine herself so that she's not relying on looking at someone else, especially because it's changing the alignment of her body and her spine. So not only is it harming her execution of the steps because she doesn't know what they are, but it's also further harming the execution, not only from forgetting them, but also in how she's performing them since her spine is misaligned. The dancer completes the wrong step when she begins. She is supposed to be stepping twice in place before sliding outward horizontally either to her right or her left, but instead she begins with a basic salsa step forward. So this is a mistake she made in terms of the sequence and shows that perhaps she doesn't have the routine memorized as well as she should. The dancer alternates arm position. At first she has her arm bent with her wrist flicked. Now she's having her arms straight so she should just be consistent in which arm position she's choosing. Either is fine but she's going back and forth and especially since she doesn't have the choreography memorized as much as she could, she would be helping herself if she kept her arm positions consistent so that she wouldn't confuse herself even further than she is already. Her dancer doesn't travel equidistant forward and back. She's taking larger steps forward and returning to the center And then the smaller steps backwards, but her forward steps and her backwards steps should be equidistant It shouldn't be favored in one direction over the other The dancer does not extend her arms as much as she can She's bringing her arms out to her side horizontally right and left alternating And she's bending her arms To her side, however, she doesn't actually do this to her full capacity She doesn't raise her arms high enough. Her arms should be higher and they going between straight and bent which is fine But she doesn't actually execute this right now Her arms are very low and they don't reach the full height.

I would say his ratio from water to milk is about half and half. There are some ways of making milk tea where the tea is fully steeped in water and then milk is added at the end. That's the classic way. There also is a method where the milk is used as the tea's steeping liquid, whether it's straight milk or combined with water and sugar is added there. And then he's doing it another way, which is steeping the tea a little bit in the water, but then adding the milk so that they heat together. and is straining it through the fine mesh strainer into the cup. That'll help remove those loose tea leaves so that they don't get into the final cup of tea. And now he has the small cup again with a small fine mesh strainer, diameter of which is about the same size as the top of the teacup. If you used a larger strainer, you run the risk of having some of that liquid overflow from different areas where there's nothing underneath it to catch them. And so it's best to try to fit your openings with the size of your strainer. And now he's using a spoon to stir those together, the tea, the sugar, and the water. That helps the tea to activate and release its flavoring. It helps the sugar to combine and dissolve fully in the water. Now he's adding sugar to the pan.

In this case, it's important to the climber when making a dynamic move he gets to exactly look at which area of the entire hold he's going to be making the placement. In this case, he was going for this lobe down at the bottom to press the entire hand open to then apply weight once the climber gets to drop onto that piece. The climber wasn't able to achieve it potentially because he needed to make more force of the twist in order to gain more length. In this case, for him to palm the hold from above in order to get that grip but has missed able to apply friction on it. Here the climber does a foot swap. And this foot swap, because the hold is so big and most of the toe box surface of the foot can be pressed against this hold, the climber does transfer the weight over onto the grips to release the pressure from the feet. And he does this by pushing with the left toe against that hold and quickly replaces it by placing the right toe. As he's leaning back to create pressure onto that foot placement. The climber here is starting at a one hold start and places both hands onto the same hold. This is called matching. Now the climber is holding on on a hand position that's called pinching. So he pinches the hold on a grip position that seems to be like a clamp motion where a lot of the power is generated by the thumbs down below. And to give force to the pinch also from above the climber must lean back in order to secure the grip. Now since the climber is starting at the start holds, once the climber gets to bring the feet up to the wall then the climb will start. Here the climber has made the reach outright. Now in order to do that the climber has to stand up on the right toe and press pretty hard to gain distance. Now the climber is also pushing away from that hold to stay outright. Other components for the climber achieving the reach is for him to pull himself in on that pinch and that so he can also bring his chest close to the wall to help the reach. And it's important that the climber keeps the right side of his body close to the wall. As we can see he has brought the right leg with the knee inwards. This to help the climber keep his right side towards the wall. The left leg has been extended to use for balance. This is called flagging out and we can see how the climber had bended the knee and then pushed forcefully down. This to help the climber when propelling up for the reach. Here the climber has made the stance off the mat and quickly has extended the right leg down. So the leg extension is actually called flagging in or a flagging position. And so the climber is using this leg to stay stable. As he brings his hips close to the wall, he needs to keep his hips square. Reason why he sends the left knee to be pointed out. Since he needs to engage really on bringing those hips close to the wall to transfer the weight over to the highest foot, the climber pushes down the right toe against the wall. This to stabilize and keep it steady. The hips in its place being as close as he can to the wall and then quickly has made the transfer of the left hand over to grip at the bottom of this pinch. The closer the grip, the better the pinch because it will have more force when it's a closed grip rather than if it was on the wider area of the pinch.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Their hand was actually able to get over the top of the hold, but their left hand and legs are all so low that it's pulling a lot of weight in this direction.

He's also very nicely shaping and clearly shaping his arms as he's performing these turns, which is helping him with his clarity and stability, and finding some connection to the rhythm through his footwork as well. Overall, he's executing these turns with a fair amount of precision and appears confident as he's doing so. As the dancer performs this cross step, he starts to lose his connection to the rhythm, particularly in his feet, and is losing some of that clarity and precision that he had up until this point. This could probably just be benefited from some additional rehearsals, some understanding of the transitions, as well as some deeper understanding of rhythmic embodiment. As the dancer begins with a basic stationary salsa step, he demonstrates that he has a basic understanding of the movement vocabulary. He is able to stay connected to the rhythm primarily through his feet, though he is incorporating his arms in a basic way that makes sense choreographically. He would benefit from bending his knees more, dropping his pelvis back, and being more grounded in his movement to activate a greater range of motion in the pelvis and up through the upper body. As the dancer performs this step-touch movement, you can tell the dancer is really confident and clear in this moment. He starts to incorporate his head choreographically, which is the first time he is doing so, and finds a lot of clarity in the incorporation of his arms and his feet again, which is helping him to connect or reconnect back to the rhythm. He would benefit from dropping the pelvis back more, bending the knees and being more grounded overall, as well as more deeply incorporating the pelvis and the upper body. However, this is a moment where the dancer feels confident in his ability, and it shows. As the dancer transitions into another basic salsa step where he locomotes slightly from side to side, he continues to maintain a consistent clarity in his footwork as well as the incorporation of his arms. However, he is really lacking rhythmic embodiment through the rest of his body, particularly in his pelvis, through his spine, and up into his shoulders. Bending his knees and dropping the pelvis back more to ground him more would help, but he also needs to think about movement dynamics and rhythmic embodiment through his entire body and not just through his limbs.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This is a good tool to choose because it incorporates air into the mixture and it helps break up the seasoning and the egg yolk so that it's more easily combined. He takes the handle of the pan and swirls the oil around the surface of the pan. This is so that when he adds the omelet to the pan, he can ensure that it will not stick. Alternates to using oil would be butter or pan spray. Here you can see that he does that successfully and uses the flat spatula to then flatten out the remainder of any bumps that have come up on the surface of his omelet. In his next step, he cuts his eye, his gas eye, to medium high and puts his omelet pan on top. I like that he has waited until this part of the recipe to start the heat on his pan, instead of starting it at the beginning of the recipe in which the pan would be too hot. Starting it at this time allows him to slowly heat it up, add the eggs at an appropriate time, and not overcook the mixture. He takes his single egg and cracks it with the back of his paring knife and then cracks it directly into the mixing bowl. This is one great way to do it. You could also just crack the egg on the edge of the mixing bowl or on the countertop. He exhibits very good knife skills in that he slices his onion lengthwise in a quick stroke and then grabs all of the slices together as a bundle and slices them crosswise to create a fine dice. To cut the vegetables he will use this small paring knife. You could also use a chef's knife. Again, here I would like to see him take this eggshell and put it directly into the garbage. The outside of the egg is very dirty and contains a lot of bacteria that could contaminate his workspace. Here he is seasoning the egg mixture with salt. It appears to be about a fourth of a teaspoon. I believe that he should do this step after adding the egg to the bowl. However, they could be done in this manner. He will let it cook for 1.5 minutes on this first side and 30 seconds on the second side. That is sufficient timing for cooking an omelette. Once the entire surface of the omelette is almost fully cooked in this white visual cue here, he is ready to flip his omelette in one with the bottom of a flat spatula. You can see here that he pushes the omelet side down so that some of that still remaining raw egg can move to the side of the pan and cook more evenly. After cutting his vegetables, he transfers them to the mixing bowl directly by lifting up the cutting board and scraping them with his paring knife into the bowl. He does this carefully and efficiently. This is a very expert level way of transferring the chopped vegetables to the mixing bowl. Once the pan is hot, he adds his egg mixture directly into the center of the pan in a smooth single layer as you can see here. You can audibly hear that the oil is very hot and is going to make his omelette cook at a rapid pace. The first step to cooking an omelet is gathering all of your ingredients and the tools that you will need to complete the task. He adds about one tablespoon of oil to the hot pan. Here, I would like to see him use a measuring spoon so he knows exactly how much oil he's adding. One teaspoon to one tablespoon is adequate for the one egg omelet that he's about to cook. However, it's always better to measure your ingredients so you know exactly how much you're using. He whisks it swiftly until it's combined and then he is ready to put it into his omelet pan. Here you can see that he folds the cooked omelet in half. This is what we know to be a traditional or a classic preparation of an omelet where it is folded in half after cooking. Here he is chopping the serrano pepper in rounds crosswise. This creates a very, very small slices. You can see that the omelet is cooking very quickly around the outside where it is turning into a yellow-white. While the center is still kind of an orange-y brown color, he would be better served by spreading this mixture out so that it's all one layer. After cutting a small section of the red onion off, he peels the skin off to the side of the work surface here. I would like to see him go ahead and directly throw this excess garbage away. That way it doesn't risk getting into the mixture for the omelet. The last step in cooking an omelette is serving it and transferring it from the hot griddle pan to your plate. He grabs a wooden cutting board, which appears to be previously clean, a small red onion, and a serrano pepper.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

So if you can get here, you're probably going to get your hand on the finish hold. You might not top, but you'll probably get your hand on the finish hold. Alright, so here we have the climber technically one move in on this boulder. The right foot is on what was the start hold, left hand matched on this jug, getting ready to spring. And the climber bails from that position. They're not really using this big platform foot, and I'm not sure why. Maybe it's based on how they read the boulder, or if they're still using the laser pointer, maybe they don't really know. I'm sure that it was communicated to them somehow that that is on, but it just seems very obvious. And I haven't been on the boulder, so I wouldn't know, but that is on, and I think that that's probably what needs to be used. And so the climber actually crossed under to get this right hand on which was super interesting. I'm not sure why they did that, must have just felt right in the moment, but nevertheless they do get into the match position and they're actually looking over to the right here for footwork.

She is extending up on her feet. That's good. But let's get that guide hand up here. It's leaving the hand. The guide hand should be up here a little bit. I love how the ball is coming off these fingertips. Nice job. Her follow through needs to be a little higher. It came, it kind of came low and across her body. That's probably where the ball is going to go. Let's spread our feet so we have a really good base of support on our landing. Again, let's get that guide hand up here. I love this. Look at how the hand, it's not sitting on the palm of her hand, but she's got really good hand placement here. But again, you know, when you're learning, this is great. This is what you want. In a game situation, let's get that guide hand up here. She's very vulnerable to turning it over. Again, she's just kind of moving side to side, but in all her movements or non- movements, she is looking up at the rim. She knows where her body is in relation to the backboard and the basket. But here, you know, she's just kind of, you know, you're learning to shoot. This is exactly what I would want to do. And sometimes, so people don't shoot with two hands, you take that right hand out of the shot. So, in her case, she's learning just to shoot it. This is good. This is really, really good here. You know, she's not quite there with the mic and all the footwork and the movement from side to side. But if I'm learning to shoot a layup, this is what I'm going to do. Get that left hand behind the ball. I love it. She's got her fingers spread. She's at the right angle in terms of shooting the basketball. Again, she got the rebound on the right side. Ideally, to improve the execution of this drill, we really would want to work on just the footwork and the timing of getting the ball out of the net or off the rim to go to the other side by stepping through here. We're not quite there yet. She's just kind of getting the rebound and then kind of, in some cases, is traveling to get to the other side. Her main focus here is just to shoot the layup. But you can see her get the rebound, and she's looking up, which is good. She's trying to see where she is, but she's traveling. She's moving her feet. Here, I'd get that left hand more up on the ball. I mean, the left hand should be here to help guide it up there. Let's spread our feet. Again, good extension here of the shooting hand, snapping of the wrist, the ball is high on the backboard. Here we start to see a little lift going up on the balls of our feet, that's nice. Let's get that guide hand up here, it should be in the picture here a little bit. Here she moves to the right side. I like that she's got her guide hand up there on the ball. She's lifting it with two hands, which is what you want. And this is just real token pressure here with that guide hand. Let's spread our feet out. Good base of support again there. Again, working on that right hand layup. Let's spread our feet though a little bit. She is dropping her hip and bending her knees. You see the guide hand? I might want to keep that on there a little bit longer because she's still raising the basketball. Ideally, I would love for her to go off that right, left foot and extend that right knee and lift. But again, as she's learning to shoot a right-hand layup and a left-hand layup, there's nothing wrong with what she's doing. Great extension. She's definitely aiming for that backboard. Here the shooter is shooting a left hand layup on the left side. Here she's just really relying on her upper body and especially the left arm. I love how the ball's sitting here. She's got the shooting hand behind the ball, maybe slide those fingers up a little bit. Because she doesn't have her guide hand on, that's why the ball's kind of sitting her hands under the ball. But if she got that guide hand up here to help guide and support it, she could bring that shooting hand a little bit more up and behind the ball. But good lift here, good angle to use the backboard. Good, let's spread our feet a little bit. I love the knee bend. Let's get that guide hand here on the side. I love her eyes and head are up. Good extension of the right arm, the shooting arm. Let's, you know, good extension how it follows the ball to the basket. Look here, she's jumping, lifting. That's a much better job of getting off the ground. And look at that arm bar. It's bent. If there was a defender, she's got her body between that defender and the basketball. Here, good lift and follow through. The ball's high on the backboard. We'd love for her feet to be a little bit apart here to give her a good base of support and balance. Again, good extension here of the hips and legs. She's going up on the balls of her feet. Again, you can see her guide arm is down. I would love for it to be up here a little bit, but beautiful extension here of the shooting arm. The ball, you can see the ball coming off the fingertips. Here again, she's got herself to the left side. Ideally, I would love for her to go off the right foot and drive that left hip up as she shoots with her left hand. Here she's moved to the right side. Love that. I would recommend getting her feet a little bit apart. I love that she's bending her knees to get a little power to lift. As she's lifting, I can see this guide hand coming off the ball. That's that's okay. And she's at a really good angle to use that backboard.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

They look really good going around and she was able to hold her balance when lifting her knee up. So here might be one of my only corrections for this dancer. I think she definitely could have bent this right knee a bit more, really extend this leg out, and then with her left arm really drag it all the way down. She didn't really get as low as she could have, so just really fulfilling that full movement range of motion in the arm. So overall, this was definitely a really great job. Not really any notes of corrections. All of her movements look great. She stayed on her, on the balls of her feet, kept her knees bent, kept the rhythm, had a little personality in there. So just really overall, nice job, nice example for this intermediate salsa. So here, nice smile on her face, a little personality, the arm reaching out. With her legs, she's just stepping side to side, nice space between her legs. Her knees are bent, and as she steps out, she is kind of rolling her body back and forth throughout the steps. So really nice flow and moving to the rhythm. So from the beginning the dancer starts really strong with all of her steps. They are all accurate. She has a really nice even flow throughout her body. Her knees are bent nicely and she's able to incorporate her upper body and arms really well. So nice job starting off. So a really nice turn. She was definitely spotting with her head, her head whipped around quickly to get her fully around and it was a really nice clean turn. So here, when she did the head roll, that was nice because her head dropped all the way down past her shoulders. The arm reach up right before this pause could have extended for about a second longer, really holding that note out and then moving into the next step. So up to here, again, really great job, great use of the arms, extending them out, keeping everything nice and strong, and also stepping and dancing to the correct beats.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So from this position here, we want to make sure we have good side spin on the ball. And in this attempt, he put he placed the ball correctly on the backboard for the proper use of the side spin he put on the ball and the ball spin off of the backboard and directly into the basket. we look at the placement of the ball we can see here that is well without as well outside of the square on the backboard as it made contact here on the backboard and from this angle here you can see that it hit the backboards just slightly either on the line of the square or slightly below looks more to be slightly below the square since it is it made contact with the backboard so far away from the square we have to put a really good amount of side spin on the ball in order for the ball to spin off the backboard and go into the basket we have to put the correct amount of side spin in this situation in order for it to spin off the backboard and go into the basket if we do not put the correct amount of side spin on the ball considering where the ball was placed on the backboard this is how we end up missing the layup The player shows the proper footwork for doing a right hand reverse layup off of one leg by making sure that he jumps off the correct foot, which is his left foot. As you can also see, as he's leaving the ground, he's lifting up his right knee, although from this angle it's hard for you. You can't see how high his knee is. As you can see the distance between his feet as his left foot is still off the ground and his right foot is off the ground in front of him, in front of his body, which lets you know that his knee is up high. When that knee is up, we want to get that knee up to the shoulder level, excuse me, up to his waist level. When we jump off of one foot and we get, if we jump off our left foot and we get that right knee up to our waist level, that really helps us to explode into the air and get up to the highest point possible with our jump. on this attempt you can see that now the ball made contact on the backboard inside of the square. From this angle you can see that it is actually above the top portion of the square so it made contact above this top portion of the square and inside the right side of the square. So the placement in which the ball made contact on the backboard from this position we do not want any side spin on the ball because if we put side spin on the ball while the ball made contact in this position on the backboard it's going to spin off the backboard and we're either going to miss it long to the left side of the rim or it's going to hit the left side of the rim and bounce off and we miss the shot. In this case he put side spin on the ball and the position on the backboard in which the ball made contact we didn't need the side spin to be placed on the ball. If we're going to use side spin we have to make sure that the ball makes contact either on that line of the square or somewhere outside the square. That's when side spin becomes useful for our reverse layups. You can see here the ball is still on his fingertips as he's releasing the ball. His right arm is completely straight and the ball is extended high and as far as possible away from his body as he releases the ball. This helps to keep the ball away from the defense who is coming in from his left shoulder and they want to contest the ball from this angle by him keeping the ball high and away from his body extended out on the right side. It helps to keep the ball away from the defense making it less likely for them to block or contest the shot. Also you can see his left arm is here. He has his arms close to his body. Ideally we would want this arm out and sort of like in this angle extended out to protect the ball from the defense. So now if he has his arm up like this, now the defense if they try to contest the shot they first have to go through his left arm. They will make contact with his left arm. That will either be a foul or it will slow the defense down long enough to allow for the shot to be released from his hand before they have an opportunity, the defense has an opportunity to contest or block the shot. So we also want to have our off arm up to protect the ball as we release the reverse layup.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

You want to just make sure you have flexion in both your knees and keep them shoulder width apart. Also here, although he came from this way shooting, you want to be able to shoot but not glide or land and fade to either side. What can eliminate that is making sure you have a low base, a low center of gravity. That way you can explode up and still come down stationary versus continuing to fade. Standing straight up after that shot, I would highly not recommend. After you release the ball, holding a follow through, you should still have a little flexion in your knees versus standing straight up with them locked. Now right here he began to shoot here but ended up almost at the three-point line. Just remember when you shoot you want to go straight up and down and not fade back. Right here, the two pointed fingers are pretty good. A little space here. He's got hands on his thigh. All of this looks pretty good. Feet, shoulder width apart. He's balanced, straight up and down. Nothing but net. Landing on his heels is definitely not ideal as well. Like I mentioned before, you want to jump off two feet and kind of land on the balls of your feet versus your heels. Right here as you can see the follow through is down. You want to make sure your follow through stays up after you shot the ball. Right here, two hands alone. The follow through is here, but one hand should be long, one hand should be short, not both be long. Or here. Landing on one foot is not ideal. You want to make sure you land on both feet for stability purpose and safety purposes. Right here, pretty good job keeping that opening that way you can see the basket, you can see the target.

Their arms kind of stay just in this natural position down to their sides. Their torso stays fairly erect and stiff from the shoulders down through the pelvis, and they don't really engage the head in any meaningful way, which shows that they really are lacking an understanding of the movement vocabulary and really focused on the footworks and the mechanics of what's happening in the lower body in particular. As the dancer performs a series of rock steps and triple steps, this time moving forwards and backwards in the space, she really significantly falls off the rhythm here and is really lacking a connection to the music. She would benefit from a deeper understanding of both the movement vocabulary and the music itself. Perhaps this could be enhanced through a deeper bending of the knees, a dropping back of the pelvis, and deeper incorporation of the upper body in general, as well as just some additional rehearsal or practice prior to this performance. As the dancer performs a series of rock steps and triple steps, she struggles to stay connected to the rhythm and embody the rhythm in any meaningful way. Particularly in her footwork, she's able to maintain the speed needed to keep up with the music. She would benefit from bending her knees more and dropping her pelvis back so that she's more grounded and able to activate a greater range of motion in her body. She also would benefit from incorporating her arms with more clarity. Right now they're just kind of swaying and sticking out naturally from the sides of her shoulders, which I feel is keeping her from being able to embody the rhythm more deeply. And she's got a fairly stiff shoulders, spine, and pelvis, which is keeping her in this very upright position and holding her back from being able to move at the tempo required for this movement. As a dancer appears to be performing a rock step to the front, they're missing a really key portion of the rock step which is this exchange of weight. As you can see here, they're using their left leg to step out in front of them. However, they're not placing their foot completely on the ground and transferring the weight from the back foot to the front foot which is integral to performing the rock step here and also staying on the rhythm of the music by adding this kind of swing into the movement. Here they would really benefit from just really stepping down on that working leg, bending deeply through the knees as well as a deeper engagement of the pelvis in this movement, dropping the pelvis back and remaining kind of low and grounded to the floor so that they're able to transfer their weight quickly and efficiently with clarity while remaining connected to the rhythm. The dancer demonstrates that she's able to remember and perform choreography here, however she's missing a really important part of the rock step and the triple step, which is the actual swing of the movement. She's performing everything on one beat, performing the rock step and the triple step on the same count, same beat, without any specific movement dynamics or swinging of the timing or the rhythm. Here she would just benefit from, in general, understanding how to embody the rhythm more deeply and how to connect her movements to the rhythm. So rather than performing everything on a one, two, three, four count, she would instead perform the rock step on a one, two, three, and four, five, and six, seven, eight. So instead of performing everything on the downbeat, she would be able to find more intricacy within the embodiment of the rhythm, which in general just takes practice and more familiarity with both the movement vocabulary and the music.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Looking at the finished result from the player's right-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice on both frames the player did not provide enough accuracy getting the ball inside the rim. However, we'll bounce off the rim resulting in the incomplete layup attempt. Looking at the player going into their right-handed reverse lip attempt on the right frame, an improvement the player can make is bringing their ball placement position above their shoulders with both hands on the ball before going into the release allowing more ball control and security going into the finish as well as creating space and separation from opposing defenders In the game-like scenario trying to take the ball", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The feet are far enough apart to maintain her balance and keep her weight really even. Amazing plie. I love how she's got her arms here on her thighs. That's going to help to keep this position nice and low. The dancer has lost the curve that she began to make because she straightened out through this part of her spine too early and actually also through her cervical spine too early. So at this point I would expect that she would still be in this sort of a shape in this particular movement, but she's pretty much all the way straight here. So she lost, she didn't follow through that spinal movement there. One thing that might actually help her, maybe not so much with the spinal movement, but just in general, if she had a slightly wider stance in this moment, like if this foot was more here while this one was here, that might give her a pelvis a little bit more freedom. She may feel like she could make more of a curve, but regardless a slightly wider stance here would be a stronger position. Here's another moment that the dancer loses a shape that could be really, really strong. She's made this new shape with her arms and she's come up to a standing position. She did a good job getting there pretty quickly, but as soon as she hits this arm position, she drops it. So I would just recommend get there right on time, hold it for a millisecond, really let that show be a strong shape before you drop it. I don't think the dancer really understands the step very well because she's doing these movements with her feet, but she's emphasizing her elbows bending and straightening really quickly, and I really don't think that's what was meant to happen because it looks super, super awkward and strange. And that's not typical for a salsa to be focusing on the elbow movements. I would think that there would be more through the legs. And again, you can see that this dancer tends to have a straight knee and a weak base here, so that might be part of it. She looks really strong and also quite elegant in this section. She's staying on the balls of her feet. She's doing this basic salsa step quite well. She's doing a good job in this moment of emphasizing the music, so the lyrics are having a da-dum, and she's doing a really nice ba-dum with the, not just her arms, but really the motion of her hips as she's coming around to face upstage. So the dancer has actually hit this moment with her arms a little bit too early. And this is another example of a moment where because she hit it a little early, great, that's a moment to pause and hold it and make it look super, super strong. But you can see that there's actually no shape here. And that's because she's already bringing it down as soon as she hits it and she's rushing the music. So again, encouraging her to, I know it's kind of counterintuitive, but slow down so she can go faster. So she did indeed have plenty more time to complete her spinal roll downwards because here she's having this sort of pause moment in this awkward shape because she's ahead of the music now. So I think this is, again, a really common mistake that folks make in dance is when we learn a choreography and then we're going to do it faster than how we learned it. So that's usually how it goes. We usually start by learning something slowly and it's usually slower than the music. What happens when we speed it up is we are so nervous that we're going to go too slow that we end up actually going too fast, even though the music is faster. So we end up rushing. And that's really, really common and I think that's happening for her here. I think she's rushing and then she has this extra time. But rather than filling it with something that's beautiful and interesting, she's having to fill it with these transition moments. This moment looks really quite stiff and I think that's partly because the elbow is in front of the face It'd be much nicer if it were a little bit further away from her body She's also kind of holding this arm really tense in a tense way right against her body here I would also say if she could emphasize either head going in the same direction as the fist or opposite to kind of find a way to give that a little bit more smoothness and maybe even bringing this hip around at the same time that The arm goes around it would emphasize the arm movement and potentially make it a look a little less stiff Pretty clear shape here. She's used the hand of the, she's used the left hand to grasp the right wrist. Pretty strong shape there. I might consider just having her extend her fingers more or put this into a fist to just add a little dimension there. A little bit broken through this part of the spine here which is causing her to have to jut her chin forward a little bit here which is a little bit of an awkward position. Great strength here through this tabletop position. So she's really, she set herself up for success because she planted her feet, while her bum was on the floor, she planted her feet in a good width for her and then had this hand flat on the floor with fingers splayed, so that'll be nice and strong. And in this moment, what she's done really well is lined up her shoulder with her wrist so that this will mimic the shape of lining up here, which is really strong and creates this nice 90 degree angle tabletop as she juts her pelvis forward. Only thing I would say to make this line even better, I would recommend that instead of bending the wrist here, I'd recommend it be straight, but other than that, this is a great moment. Again, another awkward transition. She sort of just flung these arms down and it looks really weak and not very strong here. Here's another example of a poor transition. She's just got her hands on the sides of her head here. And it's like, the question is why? Like, what's the intention of that? And you can tell that what's happening, especially because the feet are in these two different orientations. One is turned in, they're both turned in towards each other a little bit. It's obvious she's in a transition moment and she knows that the next step she's supposed to have her hands on her head. It looks really unclear and lacks, yeah, it just lacks clarity. And again, dancing through every transition, she might have more time in the music than she thinks to get her hands on her head. She doesn't need them there so soon, probably. So the dancer has come from facing upstage to facing entirely downstage, bringing this arm around and into in front of her. She did this too slowly. She is technically in time with the music, but this is a punching movement that could have been a lot more quick and strong and exaggerated. So I'd see, I'd recommend that she find a way to just kind of bring that around a bit more quickly. Again, I think using her plie, maybe using the balls of her feet a little bit more as she turns could really help with that. So here the dancer has maintained this excellent tabletop position, but she's really compromised it with whatever's supposed to happen with this arm. So she brought the arm down by her pubic symphysis and has brought it up this way while keeping the elbow bent the whole time. It sort of looks like if I, if she were to finish that, that the arm would continue going in this direction or even in this direction, but end up with a straight elbow. But this is the height of this for her. It looks really, really awkward and strange. So just encourage her to figure out what's actually meant, what's the intention of this movement with the arm and making it really clear and crisp. Another example of not dancing through transitions, she's just recovered from a layout, appears to be doing something else next. This is very pedestrian, there's no real shape or symmetry here, the neck, the head is straightforward. So again, finding ways to dance through the transitions would really help this dancer. As the dancer is untwisting here, she was twisted and facing more up in the upstage direction, and she's now sort of untwisting. For some reason, she's brought her gaze upward here, and it really makes it look kind of awkward. It takes away from the line that she could be making here. Perhaps she's bringing the gaze upward because she knows that she needs to untwist upward in a way. But the head should not be what's leading that. It should really be coming from the feet. But I can see here that the feet are not super firmly, strongly planted. So that's probably why she's having to compensate by using her head here. Here the dancer has broken her plane. So the plane of her body that she was making her arm, so she's brought this right arm up and around, and the plane that she was in was just slightly more forward here, but in this moment, she's gone behind that plane with the arm. So she's kind of broken this shape that she was making. She's also broken her wrist here at the hip. And again, this gaze being sort of non-specifically off in this direction is taking away from all of this. The dancer again has lost another moment where she could really make a really strong shave and give us a really beautiful freeze frame. Unfortunately, she has not hit this moment quickly and before she even gets there, because she's not hit it quickly enough, even though she's technically in time with the music, she didn't get there quickly enough so she can't hold it for a millisecond. She has to immediately drop it so that she'll stay in time with the music. So I encourage her to really punch that and hold it and then move on. In this step, which I think is more like a classic salsa step than any of the other steps we've seen so far, I would really see encourage her to bend a little more through the knees. Maybe be on the ball. She's pretty good on the ball of this foot, maybe a little bit more on the ball of this foot. And let's see some movement with the hips side to side rather than just these arms, which also again look kind of stiff. This is a really good layout moment here. She's done a great job bringing this leg up nice and high. These arms out here are beautiful and straight, lots of energy out through the fingertips. Nice job really allowing this cervical spine to arc. I would encourage her to find a way to have this spine, it's hard to draw because I can't draw in three dimensions, but I would like to see, let's say we're looking at her from the side. So right now, if we're looking at her from the side, what we would see is, well, let me do this a little bit differently. So if this is her head, she's got her gaze upward, beautiful, good arc through the cervical spine, but the rest of her spine, let me do this again because I'm not doing what I want. So here's the cervical spine, rest of her spine's pretty straight down. She's done again, a great job with that leg being nice and high. And then this leg is pretty straight. So to make this layout even more effective, really the layout is all about, layouts are all about this line with the leg that's in the air. So what could really improve this, rather than trying to make the line happen just from the cervical spine, if she could make it happen with the whole spine. So what I'd ideally like to see is something more like this. If this is the spine, this is the kicking leg and this is the standing leg. Unfortunately, she's compromised the amazing base that she made here because she swung her hip up to the right. What would have made this step so much more interesting and effective is if she had maintained that deep, deep plie and maintained everything facing downstage and just used her internal rotation of her hip to make this happen. That would have really maintained a nice clarity, consistency, and interest. She's kind of lost that here with bringing this hip up to the side. Here she's recovering from a second kick with the left leg and it looks really really strong right in time with the music. This is an example of an excellent transition into the floor. She's in the middle of moving from a kind of a low second position, moving towards the floor. And what she's doing is instead of going on the knee first, she's kind of using the shin on the floor as a nice soft cushion. And she's also beginning to put some weight onto this hand to help her get around. Once again, the dancer needs some support around dancing through her transition. She's transitioning here into another new step, but she's bringing these arms down pretty slowly while doing nothing interesting with the legs. So I think what's happening is she had a little bit more time in the music to complete her turn before she had to transition, so she's having to sort of fill the time. And I don't think she's doing this consciously, it's all probably subconscious, unconscious, and that's part of the problem. What we really need to do is get super conscious about every single moment while we're performing. So here's where the dancer has had to recover by coming down onto her heels. She had been on the balls of her feet in this position, but she didn't have enough strength to hold that in the moment, so she had to bring her heels down. And that really just, it loses the moment because this moment was really strong with the shape, but also perfect with the music. And she's had to slowly bring these heels down in a way that it looks unintentional and doesn't emphasize the music in the right way. This is a really quick moment here with these arms. She had her opposite arm up and opposite arm down, and now she's switched to the other side. She's done a good job doing that really quickly in time with the music. Here the dancer is starting a turn, but it looks like she's starting more with her arms than her legs. This knee is straight She looks like she's about to step on this right leg. So she's left leg. So she's not preparing herself well for her turn I'd recommend a plie here put the weight fully on this leg Use the spring of that plie to help her push on to the other foot to turn Don't start the movement with the arms. That's never gonna help. You really need to start from the bottom She's doing a pretty good job here transferring her weight. So she's come from a tabletop position with her body completely up towards the ceiling. And now what she's done is transferred her weight more onto these two points of contact, the left and right leg, and is bringing, sorry, left arm and left leg and bringing the right leg around. She's doing a good job. The only thing that would make this even smoother and more successful is if she could keep her weight over her shoulder. Here you can see there's a kind of an angle here. It's best when you're doing this transition around the arm to really make the arm be the pivot point and keep this joint really straight. So one thing that could help is maybe even bringing this foot a little bit closer so that she could keep the pivot point right above that shoulder. That would make it a little smoother here. Here she's doing a good job of using her plie and a strong base and she's also starting this arc from her lumbar spine which is great and that is and I can tell because the energy is coming out this way the Cervical spine is still curved this way as this spine this part of her spine is curved So it's making it a backwards C, which is really nice This is what I was hoping to see in the previous movement, just turning in through the hip. So she's doing a good job here. So pretty strong base through this standing leg. And instead of coming up with the pelvis to make this hip have a different shape, what she's done is she's kept her pelvis pretty stable and is just rotating the hip inward, which looks really strong. So because the dancer did not have a great pivot point with the arm as she brought this leg around, she's gotten stuck in this position and it looks really really awkward. She doesn't, she kind of holds this for a second and it doesn't look like it's meant to be held. So that would, that has to do with where her weight is here on the arm. Again a stiffness for this dancer I think what she really needs to work on is some flexibility through the spine and maybe a little bit more strength through the core For some of these spinal movements, you can see this is super awkward She's on the balls of her feet So her weight is more forward than it needs to be and that's because she's jutted her pelvis forward at the heaviest part of the Body really is now forward which is dragging the rest of her body behind her rather than having a nice solid base here pelvis in more of a neutral position This looks like the beginning of a body roll and this is not a good way to prep for a body roll the Gaze should be more up Because the body roll really needs to start with the cervical spine making this arc before the rest of the body makes it Good job hitting a strong position here right on the music. I like that she's on the balls of her feet. It makes a nice line going forward. You can see here, though, that she's hyperextended her elbow. So I think in general, a dancer needs a little bit of strength training, especially through the arms. This could be a really lovely moment, but she hasn't hit it. So here the hand is on the hip, this other arm is coming up while this right foot is coming forward and across. Unfortunately, again, she's not punching into this very well. She's kind of moving into this moment a little bit too slowly to really add that interest in that pizzazz. So I'd love to see if she could punch it and hold it rather than sort of hitting it and then being done with it. She has never ever actually hit it. She sort of makes the shape sort of slightly and then she's immediately done with it. So I'd encourage her, hit it, hold it, move on. Great plie here. Good job keeping the arms nice and symmetrical. Good job doing this movement really quickly. I love that She focused just on turning the hip in rather than using the pelvis to help her nice position here with this arm great straight arm Here I like that. She's looking away at the same time again, though. She doesn't really hit this and hold it She sort of lets it go too soon and it takes away from these beautiful shapes. She's making There's a stiffness here that the dancer kind of exhibits throughout the choreography in this video. She's doing a run up stage and backwards. And I think a lot of the stiffness is kind of demonstrated in the tension through the arms here, and also this forward neck, head posture. But there's a tension through this elbow and there's a tension through this wrist. You can see that the fist is sort of pointing upward. So if I drew a line here through the arm, we would see more like that, which demonstrates a tension, which is typically evidence that the dancer is really focused on getting the feet correct, and so has put tension unnecessarily here in the arm. And you can see this opposite arm is doing something quite different. Although there is tension through the elbow, the fingers are open here, and so there's an asymmetry there. It's almost like she's trying to use this elbow going up and back to help her move backwards, which really she needs to be using the strength of her legs. So I would encourage her to get even into a deeper plie and use that plie as a spring to help her move backwards. Good job with this little shimmy here. Great job in this moment. She's moving upstage and to her right. Really good job with these strong arms, nice straight elbows. It looks like energy coming out the fingertips, which I love to see. Again, breaking at the shoulder and breaking at the base of the cervical spine, which again is indicating that her energy is not coming from her core, it's coming from each of these joints. And that's creating this forward jutting of the chin, which is taking away from this line that she's making here. She's done a really good job here of transferring her weight really quickly and doing a new position really quickly and in time with the music Great plie. That's what's really helped her to get there. She's really used a plie here And I like that she's gazing up at these hands because that's emphasizing the movement with the arms The only thing I would say is if she again she's a little bit stiff So if she could find a way to maybe arc a little bit more through the thoracic and cervical Spine here to bring the gaze up that might just add a little bit more Pizazz and polish to her movement here Here the dancer's completed the piece. Again, she hit this too early, just like a millisecond too early for the music. She had more time to hit it. She's breaking her own line here by letting these elbows hyperextend. She's probably just naturally very flexible in the joints, but that means that she needs to work even harder to keep these more straight because it creates this backwards arc shape rather than the, what I'm guessing is meant to be a straight line through these, this V. Also again, chin is jutted forward which takes away again from the line here. Here once again, the dancers brought her arms down slowly from up to down. So this is just a transition moment It's very obvious that she's just waiting for the next moment. She even with her arms down like this Close to her body and her feet really close together It looks like she's more doing a gymnastics routine and it's about to do a big trick rather than dancing dancing is not about Well, some people try to make it about this but the art of dancing is not about Prepare preparation do a big trick preparation do a big trick like gymnastics is In dance and there's nothing wrong with that, but that's not dancing Dancing is moving through every moment. So even if this is meant to be a stillness, how can she put her personality? How can she put a little more energy and oomph into this moment? So she doesn't look like she's just waiting it create it loses interest for the audience So here the dancer has made a really lovely shape. She's got the arms up in this V, very symmetrical with each other, nice energy out through the arms and fingertips. I would say that for her, one thing that's happening is that rather than energy coming from her core and out her body, she's bringing her energy mainly just from her hips and shoulder joints and the base of her spine, her cervical spine. That's where the energy is originating from. That's part of the problem with this overall performance for this dancer in this video, because it prevents her from being quick and sharp about her movements, because she's not using the strongest part of her body, which is her core, to really bring the energy outwards. This is a really strong moment, though, for her. By the way, I can tell that she's not coming from the core, because see how there's a broken line here at the shoulder? She's just sort of using the shoulder to make this happen. And there's also a broken line here. The chin is a bit too forward. Anyway, she's come to a nice moment here. Everything is pretty darn straight. She's on the balls of her feet, but the problem is she doesn't have enough strength to hold this on the balls of her feet, and so she ends up having to recover by coming down onto the balls of her feet, which loses this moment entirely. She's doing a good job here having really strong clear arms straight out from the elbows nice strong fists here really really strong She's pushing through this hip She's got her weight here, and she's also pushing through the ball of this foot Which is all really excellent just would like to see this happen in a slightly punchier way just a little bit more behind it She's still going a little bit too smoothly and slowly here for me for my taste Once again, the dancer is using the arms to help her in a way that's not actually helpful. So she's already brought her arms to her head before she's done any movement here with her legs or pelvis. And she's also a little bit ahead of the music with the arms and behind the music with the hips. So she really needs to work on coordinating her lower half with her upper half. The dancer is beginning an arc with this arm here and she's done a good job of bringing the arc from a down position up in front of her which suggests that she'll probably be able to finish that arc which will make a really nice shape. I would just say that you can see here the elbow is pretty straight so that's great but she's bent at the wrist here so the rest of the hand isn't coming along with her and that's gonna detract from the line that she could be making here which will detract from the arc that she's making. Also the gaze sort of downward here and sort of off to this angle it's just not very specific and it's also taking away from the shape she could be making. Dancer has now brought this left arm from behind and up and over again in a kind of a punching motion to mimic the first Time that she did it now It does seem like this this punching movement is meant to have this second punching movement is meant to have several to last several counts but It just looked kind of weak when she's doing it that way So if it is meant to last several counts, I would just encourage her Can she slow it down even more and then lead with the fingers rather than the elbow to really just bring it down in a real? nice clear concise way Again a little bit stiff, a little bit awkward here. This arm is coming around but not in any really particular specific way. I'd encourage her to make it a lot stronger so it could pull her around into this twist. She's kind of bending at the hips which is unnecessary at this point which is causing her in order to keep her gaze straight gaze forward she's having them to bend her cervical spine and that's always look is going to look like an awkward position. This all might improve a little bit if she could bend more through these knees give herself a little bit more plie a little bit of cushion then she may not feel that she needs to bend here or here. Again, there's a lack of coordination between the arms and legs in this moment, maybe because she thinks again that she's late for the music. So here her arms have reached their zenith for this particular moment. They're as straight as they can be. They look really strong. The problem is it's not coordinated with the legs. The legs should be at their zenith as well. Right now, she's still moving into some sort of position with the legs, but she's already reached the position with her arms. I would encourage her just in general, she really needs to focus on the strength of her legs guiding her and moving her, not her arms. Because what's happened is she's made the shape up here but not down here, and she's then going to probably be behind the music and lose the shape before she's even fully made it. Here the dancer has her weight on her right leg and is bringing her left leg from around from behind around herself in this direction. She's leading with the toe here which again is breaking her line. We see that if I drew a line from the hip down to the toes it would get broken right there at the ankle. So I'd recommend that she either have her knee rotated in so she's got excuse me her hip rotated inward like this in a parallel position but then keep the toes out this way or she could consider turning her hip out so externally rotating so that her knee would be facing this way rather than this way where it's facing now and then have the toe come down in that direction. Either way it would really help to emphasize the line that she's making. I think she might be leading from the toe here because she's not in a strong position here. She really could use a deeper plie and a stronger foundation there so she could do any darn thing she wanted with this leg. Here the dancer's recovered from an untwisting position and here she's, yeah, she's sort of recovering from that moment and in a transition to whatever step she's gonna do next. And this moment is not exaggerated enough. There's not enough shape to it. Little bit forward head posture here. It's quite pedestrian. So this is an example of not dancing through a transition. So I'd encourage her to find a way to continue moving and keeping it dancing and alive all the way through her transition. Here's another example of a poor transition. So again, she's looking a little bit like she's bracing herself, a little bit tense, feet are really close together, looks a little pedestrian. You can tell she's moving between, I can tell she's moving between two steps. So again, finding ways to dance through every movement. This is better coordination. This is the second time she's done this step where she brings the knee up and the arms up. So this time you can see the arms are in their zenith and this knee is more straight, which is great. And if this is what was meant to happen in the shape here, then she's achieved it the second time only. So because the dancer was standing still with her feet together and her knees straight, she's not prepared herself very well for whatever is happening here. She's having to really use these arms swinging out again. This is another theme for her. She's having to use her arms more to help her when really the strength needs to be coming from her legs. I would say if she could have done a quick plie right before whatever she's doing here, that would really have helped. She is doing a good job of bringing the arms in this position so that as she comes around and makes an arc, it's more clear and strong. Great job here with this fast footwork. I love that she's on the balls of her feet to help this footwork be nice and strong. And I like that she's using her pelvis rotating back and forth to help her. It looks really strong. You can see here that she's continuing to move towards the floor that she looks like someone who's had experience in modern dance because this is a kind of modern dance technique to get to the floor. So what she's done is instead of staying on her knee, she's brought her shin around and she's moving her weight onto the side of her thigh, which is excellent. That's going to protect her knee, but also it's going to make this transition into the floor smooth. She's also starting continuing to bring her weight onto this left hand with this blade hand and that's going to help that point of contact be nice and strong. Good job making a quick transition from a downstage facing to this upstage facing. I would just like to see a little bit more oomph and emphasis and exaggeration here. I'd like to see this twist of the spine be even stronger in this direction and I'd also like to see her hit this position in a much more quick and staccato way. Good job moving the hips through this movement. I'd like to see a little bit more exaggerated hip movement. So in this moment with the right foot down, I'd like to see the right hip up. Yeah, so she never fully made the shape with her legs that she was meant to make. I don't know exactly what it was supposed to be, but this dangling leg does not look correct. And the knee here never got straight or straighter, even though the elbows were super, super straight up here. Another example of a weak transition moment. She had more time to complete this arc with these arcs with her arms than she thought so she's having to come down in this awkward position. So again dancing through every transition. Here the dancer has chosen a sort of a ballet shape with the arm here which is actually unfortunately cutting off the arc that she made. I would suggest that rather than curving the arm here that she actually make this elbow really really straight. She's doing a good job of having the energy come out the fingertips which would be nice if she had a straight arm. Now if she really is meant to do this ballet shape I would suggest that she follow her wrist with her gaze because this is awkward with the arm here and the hand the face sort of right by the armpit to be honest it kind of looks a little bit awkward and again taking away from the shape she's making. She's just frankly too late for the music here. So there's a nice big horn moment here that sounds like it's meant to happen at the same time as these arcing arms and she's late.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The musician on the right is continuing to play more of an accompaniment part, while the musician on the left is playing the more melodic line. Here there is a good balance where the more melodic or moving line of the piece is heard louder than the accompaniment part, and the violinist on the left is using a nice amount of vibrato on their longer held pitches. Here both violinists are getting a nice legato sound as they are using smooth full bow strokes You can see they are demonstrating proper bow hold the fingers are curved and relaxed while gripping the bow and their left hand fingers are curved over the fingerboard Here, there seemed to be some uncertainty in the violinist on the left's part. Also the sound quality was not as clear as before with this pattern of pitches in this phrase. It would help the violinist on the left to review the pitches in this phrase, practice them slowly one at a time using a tuner while making any adjustments with the left hand finger's placement on the fingerboard, and then gradually work the phrase back up to performance speed while maintaining proper intonation. The violinist on the left is playing the more melodic or moving line. They are demonstrating a nice legato or smooth and connected sound to their playing. And the violinist on the right is playing more of an accompaniment part, and some of their notes are more separated. Again here the intonation was a bit off in the violinist on the left's part. The placement of their pinky could be adjusted on that higher pitch that was just played. It would help to practice this pattern of notes in this phrase one by one using a tuner and then gradually work the phrase back up to performance speed while maintaining proper intonation. It would help if the violinist on the left reviewed this phrase multiple times at a slow tempo to adjust the weight and angle of their bow as needed to get a clearer more full sound on each of these pitches and to gain more familiarity with the pattern of pitches and more pitch accuracy here. Here the violinist on the left is demonstrating a smooth legato sound again. Their notes are nice and connected and they are using a nice amount of vibrato on their longer held rhythms. There seemed to be some uncertainty here with this transition into the next phrase. It would help to review the last phrase in the previous section of the piece leading into this new phrase multiple times at a slow tempo to gain more confidence with this pattern of pitches leading into the next phrase and to be able to play this transition at a more confident volume level. There again here seemed to be some uncertainty with their parts and the violinist had to stop. It would definitely help to review the last phrase before this new section of the piece leading into it a few times to get more comfortable with this transition. Again here the violinist did a good job of taking a breath and performing a small gesture to one another to start this entrance together. Here the musicians are doing a better job of lining up their parts rhythmically and playing at a more even, steady tempo. Again, here the parts are a bit unsynchronized and it would help to practice this section as well using a metronome. The gesture performed allowed both violinists to start this phrase together, but the transition could be a little smoother. There was almost kind of like an awkward pause before this next phrase when it would have helped to do the nod almost immediately and lead directly into this phrase to make it sound more certain and musical. Here again, the musicians stopped rather abruptly and seemed to have some confusion about the parts that they were performing here. The violinists made eye contact with one another and took a breath together to time their first entrance and start at the same time. There seemed to be some hesitation here and a pause in the piece. The violinists had some confusion and had to stop and now are restarting their phrase. They did a small gesture and made eye contact with one another to start their entrance together. Here the violinist on the left is getting a nice beautiful sound to their playing. They are playing at a soft delicate dynamic level and are using a nice amount of vibrato on their longer held pitches. There was a bit of a screechy sound quality to the pitch played by the violinist on the right. It would help them to adjust the angle of their bow and the weight of the bow to get a more full, rich sound. Again, here the intonation in the melodic line could be improved. It would help to practice this phrase note by note using a tuner, making any adjustments with the finger's placement on the fingerboard as needed, then gradually work the melodic line up to performance speed while maintaining proper intonation. The intonation could be improved in the pitch being played by the violinist on the left. Again here the parts are a bit unsynchronized. It can help to work on them using a metronome a few times just to get a more consistent even playing speed and then take away the metronome and just practice this section of the piece really listening to one another to match each other's speed. Here the parts are a bit unsynchronized. It would help to practice with a metronome to work on getting a consistent even playing speed.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And they're also trying to keep this left hand a little bit too long. It's almost as if they're not fully committing to the dyno. And they're ending up just a little bit short on the jump. So here the climber has their hand on the jug, but you can see these hips are just shooting out really fast. They lose the left hand, so they're not going into it with a ton of control. So there's a lack of connection between the takeoff point and the end position that the climber isn't able to achieve.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The reason so is you're down here in the paint, unless you're all by yourself on a breakaway, you've got to be strong and you've got to be explosive down here where there's a lot of defense. Good extension here, maybe jerking that little elbow back a little bit here, you can see here, but he's doing a really good job with his left arm being out here to help protect. In fact, a little too far under there, the ball kind of hits the bottom of the backboard and pops out. You want to have your body in a good spacing here, so if it does miss, you can still get this rebound. Here he steps over, choosing to go off two feet, powering it up. Again, would love to see more knee bend and hip action here to really lift the body up. But great job getting it to the left side. You know, it's not sitting on the palm of his hand. You might want to have that offhand here, but he's getting ready to release it. You know, the guy at hand could be up there a little higher. Great job having his head and eyes up. Here's the lift. Again, we'd love to see more explosiveness and lift here. Great job of getting the ball up to this position here. Guide hand comes off. He's got his shooting hand here on the ball. Here's the lift off two feet. Not bad. Good extension here of the left arm. The ball, you can see the ball coming off those fingers. He's got a pretty good angle here for the use of the backboard. Would love to see him step through on this right foot and really pull that left knee up, but he's doing a really good job of using the left hand on the left side. Again, he just slides from side to side, better bent knee here and dropping the hips, two hands on the ball, eyes and head are up. He's getting himself in a good position here to use the backboard. It did hit some rim here. It may still fall through. Let's get these hands and arms up, bent knee, really be ready to get this ball, rebound it, and go to the next play. Here's the finish, the release, the balls may hit rim here, maybe a little bit close to the rim, not sure. Good takeoff here of two feet. Would love to see him extend this shooting arm a little bit more toward the ball, toward the basket. You can see here he kind of jerks it back. Here the shooter is shooting a right-hand layup. He's choosing here to go off two feet. You know, I would really love to see him, you know, instead of just going on the balls of his feet, using that power layup or take off of two feet to really explode up in the air. He does a good job of keeping that non-shooting arm on this side. It's his left arm out, kind of out here, to act as a defensive barrier to the ball if there was a, this defender here. And he does a really good job of lifting the ball. Probably would love to see the guide hand stay on here a little longer. And, you know, he's got this shooting hand behind the, kind of on the side of the ball. I would like it to be more behind the ball. But great job with getting his eyes and head up on the target. Again, here we go. Got a little one-foot takeoff here, pulling that left knee up. That's the correct footwork. Love that he's got his shooting hand behind the ball, and he's at a really good angle to finish it across the glass. Here's the extension. He goes up on the balls of his feet. I like how he's, you know, kind of getting up higher and hasn't released it yet. So you want to release the ball at the height of your jump, no matter how high that is. But great job with this arm bar here. I love that a lot. Again, ideally in this drill, this shooter, the ball came through the net and see how he let it drop all the way down here. Ideally you want to get it out of the net and keep it up high. So as we move to the other side, our arms and hands are up ready to get this ball off the rim or out of the net. So the timing and footwork is crucial. He's letting it drop, he's kind of sliding over to the right side here. Here, ideally, the execution of the Mike and his timing the ball out of the net and getting that rebound and then stepping through on one foot and lifting the other. He's just kind of choosing to let the ball come down and then he kind of is going to go off two feet. And it's okay, but ideally the Mike and Jarrell is that one-foot takeoff. He's doing a really good job, though, of getting his body to a place where he can use the backboard.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So here, he has left foot, left hand. So here he could kind of make it a little bit more rigid, do a back leg, and kind of just clean that up ever so slightly. Here he could kind of tighten up his, so he does a good job keeping his feet on for the most part and staying opposite post. Right now he's reaching with his left hand, so he's got his right hand on and his left foot. The only thing that can make this slightly better is this right foot that's not really doing anything. In this case, it does seem to be kind of pushing him back off the wall, so it could be used to kind of smear into the wall and propel himself upwards. But instead, when he kind of moves, it kind of flies out. It could just be that the terrain is so much easier than what his skill level's actually at, so he's kind of able to climb a little bit more floppy and loose, but it's kind of a good technique to practice, keeping himself tight and engaged. So that way when he gets to harder holds or harder movements, he'll still utilize it. Again, you can kind of see this foot flying back. So yeah, while he does make it to the top of the wall, this is something that could kind of transfer more energy to the wall and kind of clean it up a little bit.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Now the climber does this by landing on the feet, having a loose body and at the same time keeping the arms in. Once the climber was going to make the impact and rolls backwards to then transfer the impact from the feet, squatting down and letting the feet fall up towards him and letting the climber roll on their spine. At this moment the climber kept their hands in and then stopped from rolling by sending the palms down onto the mat. Here the climber failed to reach up to the next hold. This one, the climber was already crunched up and has made a placement with the highest foot. Now the climber needed to step up 100% onto the right foot and failed to place all of the weight over to transfer it onto the stand as the climber needed to rock their hips to the high stance. This one, the climber would have to bring their hips in the moment that they were getting themselves pulled in and at the same time had to bring and rock their hips over to the highest foot. Once sending their weight to the right side and the climber would have to press harder on the foot to then go up for the reach and keep leverage to sustain the weight of the climber and drive the climber up on the dynamic move. Here we can see the climber is going up for the next move in which the climber will need to release the right hand. This one due to being positioned the lowest and the assumption of the right hand going up is because the climber has twisted the right side to be facing the wall. Now the climber to support this twist has brought their right foot into a high position and move up the knee to go inwards pointing out left. Now this is important that the climber keeps the right side towards the wall to support the reach as the climber will also need to bring their center of gravity close to the wall which is on the core or the hips. To support this twist that the climber has sent their left leg onto an extension and has dropped the foot. This one the foot will be supporting to by tapping the wall to keep the twist of the climber to stay right side in. Here the climber has engaged into a pull-up quickly to move to the left hold once the right foot was placed down below. The right foot in this instance is not in any foot chip and instead is pushing against the wall. This one so that the climber can bring his hips close to the left side as he steps up on the higher foot. Once the climber got to move their body of their hips close and rocked on top of the highest foot, once the climber was to gain stability, you could have let go of the right hand to make the reach above. Here the climber has dropped the left leg, leaving the foot not in position and instead is used only to keep the climber with balance as he would need to bring the right hip over the highest stance, being the right foot. This one will need to have the climber press most of the percentage on the leverage as the climber will need to engage power by leaning back and when the climber is ready, it's doing a pull up position that is dynamically and the climber will fully be standing up onto that right foot when going for the reach. Here we can see the climber has swapped his feet down below. This one by again doing a hop of the toe, of replacing the right toe with the left toe onto the foot chip and quickly has moved the right foot at a higher stance, placing the front of the toe box onto an edge. Now as we can see while the climber is doing the switch of feet into a new position, we can see how the climber is engaging the grip above. This one is taking the most pressure as he needs to release pressure down below for the switch as long as well as supported with the left hand that's keeping him close. But it's important that the climber is engaging mostly the grip and does not try to engage onto a pull-up position as it's important that the climber needs to later on save the energy when engaging for big moves. So he keeps the arm extended as much as possible during this switch swap of feet and placement. Here the climber is chalking up his hands. Doing this helps the climber have a better grip when on the wall as well as absorbing any sweat coming from his hands. Here we can see the climber had moved up to the next hold as static as possible. So in this case the climber didn't need to make an extension for a jump but instead needed to stay in position which was done by the climber engaging the forearm and also keeping the grip tight. While in that meanwhile when the climber was going for their reach he really needed to keep the right side towards the wall which was supported by pushing down on the left foot also keeping balance for the climber when transferring weight supported by the right foot. Here the climber looks down below to his feet. It's important that the climber does this carefully at the same time, engaging more the grips above. This so that the climber can take more of the weight and take off the pressure from the feet in order to make the foot swap. Now this type of foot swap that the climber is doing is the foot hops in which the left foot is being released and then the right foot is taking place where the left foot was. Here the climbers are starting at a one-hold start, meaning that both hands are going to be placed in the same hold. When both hands are in the same hold, this is called matching. And in this type of hold that the climbers are starting at, it's a pinch that is placed in a horizontal. So the climber must stay under it in order to create more pressure from the top and help with the pinch to bring the climber forward with the thumbs. Now the climber will start until both of the feet are off the ground and on the wall. Coming off from the mat completely, then the climber will start.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The second finger is on the second fret and then this finger is behind it and then this pinky is two frets higher and then that first finger is on the first fret. So, this is a chord shape that requires a bit of flexibility and the ability to stretch the fingers. He's, it also helps that he's keeping his thumb relaxed right here opposite his second finger and so, you can see his fingers are still curved and he's still getting a really clear sound. So, this is kind of a harder chord shape but he's making it work really well. Right here the guitarist is playing the harmonics on the guitar. So this is a spot on the guitar where you don't have to actually push down the string all the way. So he's just lightly touching the string while he plucks it and it creates this very kind of spacey, ethereal sound. And he's doing it, he got to that spot accurately with his finger in the right spot, the shift of the hand was very smooth and the harmonics sound really clear and really beautiful. His right hand finger pattern is changing a little bit between some of these chords and he's doing it with a consistent tempo, a consistent speed and the notes are very evenly played and each note rings out really clearly. As the music grows in intensity, they are speeding up the music just a little bit by executing their finger pattern with the right hand faster. So this is a speeding up, really adds intensity to the music, and it's done with a lot of control with his fingers, so that was very well done. The guitarist then had to shift their hand all the way down the fingerboard to this higher position and they did it with a ton of precision so they got to the right notes in the correct spot with a lot of precision and the movement was very smooth so that was very well done. The guitarist had to switch to a different finger pattern here or a different chord, and they did this very smoothly without much hiccup between one chord from the next chord because they placed their fingers down on those frets at the right time. So the timing and the changing between chords was very smooth. This finger right here, the ring finger, had just a moment where it wasn't pressed down hard enough on the fret, so there's a little bit of a dull sound right there for just a split second, but that's just because there wasn't enough weight on the fret. However, he fixed it pretty quickly and it was a very small little mistake. The guitarist had their finger in the wrong spot for just a moment, but then they fixed it really quickly. So I think that they had just a slight hiccup between chord changes with just one of the fingers. As they finished this musical phrase, they slowed down their finger picking a little bit, just to draw attention to the end of that section of the music. And so that was very musically done and very musically mature. The guitarist has a curved hand shape and all the knuckles are bent and they're using enough weight on each string to get a really nice clear sound. Just now he executed a couple of hammer-ons on guitar, which is when you pluck the note and then you have one finger down and then you put down another finger while the string is still vibrating. And he did many of those in rapid succession with a lot of clarity. This barred chord shape here, he's using his first finger to push down all of the strings on that fret right there, while also using his ring finger right here to pluck another string. I believe he's using his second finger to give the first finger just a little bit extra strength. And the barred chord sounds very clear. He has a good amount of pressure on the string to make it sound clear. The guitar player is using a little bit of vibrato with this finger and they're wiggling it back and forth to warm up the sound and this creates a more beautiful, more warm sound by wiggling the finger back and forth on this higher note, also adding emphasis to this part of the harmony change. So this is a very musical decision and it sounds really nice. The guitar player had to move their thumb along with the rest of the hand back to get to that lower chord. And so they did that really smoothly without much tension in their hand and then their thumb. So that was a really smooth change between chords. In the right hand, they are using a thumb with a long fingernail to pluck the bass note, and then the other fingers are strumming notes in a strumming pattern. The guitarist is doing this with a lot of precision because every note is really clear and sounds very resonant.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He's taken some cherry tomatoes and he's cutting those in half and adding them to the cucumbers in the bowl. And he's just adding a touch to his salad. And again, he's made a long cut on the cucumber and going at an angle with the two pieces parallel flat side down. Now he's cut his cucumber in half lengthwise and placed the one half of the cucumber down on the flat side. Now he's cut his cucumber in half horizontally so he's got two ends. He's using the cleaver to remove the tips off the ends of the cucumber. And he places the second half down just beside that so they're parallel and begins cutting at an angle through these. His fingers are tucked nicely, his hands are placed well for safety, and using an angle he'll get sort of a half circle but it'll be a little bit elongated. He makes nice light strokes. He's got a sharp implement which is always helpful. He's not tearing his cucumber apart. He holds his cucumber and turns it as he goes. This probably has a combination of spices and flavorings in addition to a vinegar and oil, which is the standard makeup of a dressing, and that'll give great mouthfeel, a little bit of a heightened quality to the flavors, and then just add another level of flavors, whatever the profile is of the dressing, to his cucumber salad. Here he's grabbing some kind of dressing, a pre-made dressing from his refrigerator. And now adding some fresh ground black pepper. Both play well together and both add a little hint of something else. The salt will draw liquid out of both the cucumbers and tomato. It'll also enhance the flavor. It sits on the tongue very specifically to bring out the flavors. And then the pepper will add a little zing. Freshly ground is the best way because the oils are released right before it hits the dish. And you'll get just like an earthy undertone. He's over the sink, which is great because it catches his extra less cleanup, especially if he has a disposal. You can tell his knife is sharp. It's going through these very easily without having any issues. When you have round objects like this, you wanna make sure that you have a sharp knife because you don't wanna have an incident where the knife rolls off of the tomato and then cuts you. So he's grabbed a cucumber from a bag. He makes great contact with his cutting board and his knife makes clean cuts through so he doesn't have any straggling hanging cuts. It looks as if he's going to repeat that process with this half as he's starting to do the peeling now. He's taking a peeler and now he's peeling his one half of the cucumber. He's grating some salt into his mixture. And he throws those away. And here he's got chopsticks he's using to stir his mixture, making sure it's evenly coated with his dressing and his salt pepper.

However, it is inside the outer right portion of the square. So from here, we place the ball in this position, we can have no side spin on the ball. Here on this attempt, he had a slight amount of side spin due to the way he released the ball. It created a slight side spin action as he released the ball. So once it hit this side of the rim, I hit this portion of the backboard, it spin and hit the left side of the rim. Because of the use of side spin and combination of the placement of the ball on the backboard, we end up missing this layup attempt. you look at the placement of the ball on the backboard, he just barely catches the tip of the top right corner of the square on the backboard. And because he was just able to hit the outermost position of where we want to hit the ball off of the square for this layup, it bounced down and hit the inside of the right side of the rim and it found its way to go inside of the basket. He uses the proper footwork for right hand reverse layup by making sure that he jumps off of his left foot. He also does a decent job of getting his right knee up high as he goes up and explodes off of the ground to try to jump as high as he can and release the layup. As you can see, his knee is slightly below his waist level. Ideally we would like this knee to be a little bit higher, but the action of him lifting that knee is what helps to propel him in that direction upward towards the basket. If we look at the placement of the ball on this attempt, you see it's just below the top portion of the square and it is inside the square. So it is inside that top right corner of the square. It's an excellent place to place the ball off of the backboard without any side spin and it will drop nicely into the basket. We place the ball here but we put too much side spin on the ball. We run the risk of the ball spinning either out to the opposite side of the basket and we miss the shot or the side spin will have it spin and it catches the inside of the left portion of the rim and from here it's a 50-50 proposition whether it's going to get that toilet bowl action and go into the basket or it gets that toilet bowl action and goes out of the basket. So layups are a very high percentage shot and 50-50 is too low of a percentage for us for layups. When we place the ball inside the square in this position, we don't want to put any side spin on the ball so we avoid that toilet bowl action as the ball bounces off the backboard and hits the rim. In this attempt, he does a good job of extending the ball high and away from his body in his right hand and allowing the ball to roll off of his fingertips and up off the backboard and into the basket at the apex of his jump. He also does a good job of having his left arm up as he's releasing the ball to protect the ball from the defense that's on his left side who may be trying to contest the shot. So by having that arm up, it slows the defense down just long enough or holds the defense off long enough for him to release the ball out of his right hand and into the basket before the defense has the opportunity to contest or block his shot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So it's really important that when we are alternating fingers on any given string they're only ever going straight up or straight down and not moving side to side because in this example when they moved side to side they hit another string and we had an extraneous plucked sound. So it was this flailing extraneous motion that caused us to hear this extraneous plucked sound. The last note played should have been played on a down bow, because that's the correct way to end a phrase. But also we heard a faltering, a wavering in the tone quality of this note. And that is because as the violinist played this note, you could see the bow moving from over the fingerboard to closer to the bridge. So that changed the tone in the middle. Ideally we always want to stay pretty much in the same track, in the same placement relative to the bridge in one bow stroke. The notes being played in this slur that are being played with the fourth finger are coming out as shorter than the other notes. The violinist needs to hold down that fourth finger note a little bit longer and use a little bit more bow on it because it is the highest note of that bow stroke. So in order for all of those notes to sound even, they need a little bit more length, a little bit more time, and even a little bit more length so that we can get the most volume on that note because that's kind of the top note of that gesture. So musically we want to bring that out. Every time the violinist changes strings, like where they just changed strings right here, we hear a gap in the sound and we also hear some extraneous string noise and scratching. This is just due to a lack of accuracy and too big of a motion. So the violinist needs to do just exactly as much motion as needed to get to that next string and they need to time it so their left hand is there a little bit before the right hand and then they only start moving horizontally when the left hand is in place and the right hand is on the right plane so that we only hear pitch. From the beginning we don't hear the motion and the scratchiness of getting to that location. On the double up bow played on the E string just now, we need there to be more length on each of those. The result of not having enough length in this situation was a very scratchy and very short pecky sound and that's not musically pleasing. So even though we want a short sound, it's so high up on the violin we have to use more bow, a little bit longer of a bow to get some resonance and some pitch. We're hearing that the notes played on the E string are much weaker. The violinist needs to use more bow to make these notes match in volume to the notes on the lower string. These last five notes played on the E string here lacked a lot of clarity and this is kind of the end of a triumphant phrase so we really need to hear them clearly. This is because the action on the left hand pressing down the strings was a little bit sluggish so it needs to be a more active, more of a snapping feel to hold these notes down and then the timing between the bow and the left hand was not quite in sync so we didn't have a very clear start to each one of these notes. Additionally they should have used a little bit more bow, a little bit lower placement so that these notes really popped out clearly. If we have quickly changing notes in the high register of the violin and we're playing too close to the fingerboard we're gonna lose a lot of clarity in between notes. You hear that these notes played on the high E string just here come out as a lot thinner sounding and a little scratchier than the low strings. This is because the bow is too close to the fingerboard and with too fast of a speed not connected to the string. So it's skating on top of the string a little bit. Ideally a little bit slower bow, a little bit closer to the bridge. These fast notes played at the tip of the bow had a lot of crunch to their articulation. This is because the bow speed was too fast for how little weight was put into the bow, so it wasn't fully catching the string. To get rid of this, we would need to pronate a little bit more, let a little bit more weight drop into the string, and use a slower bow speed so that each note has good contact with the string and we only hear pitch. The violinist is rushing. The violinist should have done a crescendo through this arpeggio section leading to the top note. Instead, they just played every note the same volume. But musically, the best thing to do would have been to play a crescendo here. The violinist needs to use a lower bow placement. We can see that on the high string, she is just right at the fingerboard. She needs to use a lower bow placement so that the volume of the high string will match the volume of the low string. Right now, the low string is really popping out right before she plays this up bow on the high string, and then the up bow sounds much quieter and weaker. So in order to get the same volume, we need to have a different and correct bow placement. The violinist is rushing, especially at the end of each trilled figure. We hear a great lack of clarity at the beginning of this up bow, and we also hear some extraneous sound because we hear the note begin, slightly hesitantly stop, and then continue. This is because the violinist was too quick in their motions to do everything, and they started moving the bow before they were actually on the string and had contact with the string. The correct way to do this, especially when starting a piece, gently put the bow on the string without moving it, put the right amount of weight in in your right hand, then begin the note. If it's too hasty like this and the bow is thrown down on the string, we get extraneous noise and extraneous pitch, and then we're not able to tell the clear start of the piece. We have now lost that good clarity because the violinist is not being deliberate enough with the rhythm. So now we're losing that pulse and we're losing the clarity in between notes because the fingers are flailing a bit more. We heard a lack of clarity in the left hand here, and this is because the fingers were not being moved quickly enough in this ornamentation turnaround trill figure here. We also heard a scratching at the beginning of this bow stroke, and that is because the violinist came down too quickly and started moving horizontally too soon. So they need to have a less aggressive movement to find the string, and then they need to not move until they have found that, and then they can move horizontally so we only hear pitch and not the motion to the string. This is a good example of having a very clear left hand articulation. We can hear a clear change between each of these notes and this is because it's a very deliberate and quick action with the left hand. In order to have a more efficient hand pattern and finger pattern in these slurs, the violinist should, when they put down their third finger, also put down their second finger because that's the next note that is going to be played. What we're hearing right here is that, and what we're seeing is that the violinist puts down the third finger and the second finger is in the air. Because the second finger is in the air, it takes more time to go from the third finger to the second finger. You can have, if you're playing with the third finger, the second finger can also be down, and then the motion is simply removing the third finger instead of removing the third finger and putting the second finger down. So especially right here, where it's a really quick, repeating fingering pattern, we want to do everything we can to be as efficient as possible. The vibrato that we are hearing is much too slow and it's creating kind of a seasick musical feeling. It's a good loose vibrato and the oscillation of pitch is appropriate. It just needs to be sped up so that it is adding energy to the note and not just slowly changing the pitch of the note. We are losing the poles here because the violinist is not deliberate enough with pressing down the notes in their left hand. So in a slurred section like this, all of the, the majority of the rhythm is coming from when the fingers are being pressed down. So there has to be a much more deliberate and measured action and use of the fingers in the left hand so that we don't lose the pulse and the rhythm. If the violinist is attempting an up-up bowing pattern, as opposed to just a slur on an up bow, there needs to be more space between these notes and a little bit more of a start on each note. The way they're playing it now just sounds like a slur that has pulses of weight being brought in and out of it, and that's a very muddy sound. So they need to be more deliberate with up-up and a clear start and space between each note so that we can tell that's the bow stroke that is happening. In the last four notes of the up bow that was just played, it rushed. So the violinist, and every time prior to this, those last four notes of each bow stroke in this repeating figure are rushed. The violinist just needs to spend a little bit more time on each note and be really deliberate about the time spent on each finger. Because if every time it rushes a little bit, like it is now, then we're losing the pulse and we're losing the musical flow of this repeating pattern. We're hearing the open string really pop out of this texture. They're not able to close this string because it is the lowest string, but they need to be a little bit more sensitive with the bow in order to not have that string pop out. This could be achieved by a little bit slower of a start to the note so that they make sure that there's a control of that string. The open strings will have a tendency to really vibrate widely because they have the least amount of tension on them, especially a low string. To control that vibration of the string, we need to have a slow start and then a very deliberate up bow so that it doesn't pop out and it can remain consistent with the musical texture. We're hearing that on the down bow that was just played, the notes decreased in volume as the violinist got closer to the tip. To counteract this and to do the correct thing, the violinist needs to pronate a little bit more to get the weight into the first finger and have the sound sustained all the way through the bow while the notes change in the left hand. We need much more deliberate action in the fingers of the left hand here to really make these note changes in the slur clear. So especially when we're playing the slur, we have to be a little bit snappier with the motion of our left hand and really be transferring the weight from finger to finger in between each note so that we get that clarity because the clarity can't come from the bow during a slur. It has to come from the left hand. We have a great loss of clarity when there is a repeating half step between the third finger and the fourth finger on the left hand, so we need that fourth finger to come down harder so it can really change that vibration of the string. If it's coming down too soft like it is now, that split second of the finger being pressed into the string after beginning to touch the string is where we get muddiness in between the notes, so it has to be has to come down harder and in a snappier motion. You can hear a lot of extraneous scratching noise into this up bow from the down bow because the violinist allowed the bow to rock over and be touching the two middle strings on their way to that top string. So the violinist, to get rid of these extraneous noises, needs to make sure that they rotate the bow in such a way that it's not being pulled across any string. The violinist is going directly to the high string so that we only hear the two notes that are intended to be played and not the movement in between. The correct way to play these double-stop chords with the string change in them would be to have a faster and more deliberate change string crossing to the higher notes. We hear a bit of a bit of a roll coming across these in a non-deliberate way, whereas in theory we would want to have a really clear bottom note and then a quick movement to the top notes so that we hear this as a very powerful gesture, not as a sort of ambiguous rolling gesture. The violinist is rhythmically rushing through the notes that are being played on the higher string. Additionally, those notes are coming out as weak when they should be. Musically coming out as very strong because they're playing too close to the fingerboard. This is a really excellent example of body position and good technique when playing at the tip. We can see that the violinist's shoulder is relaxed and not raised. It's in line with the other shoulder. We can see that the wrist has remained in line with the arm and has just been pronated in to put the weight into the first finger, not twisted or pressing down in. And this allows for the bow to stay on the correct plane across the string as well as straight perpendicular to the strings. So this is exactly what it should look like to be playing at the tip on the violin. In this descending scale, we had a great loss of clarity. This was due to just not having delivered enough rhythm and action of the left hand. So the result was a kind of muddy scale falling down instead of a very measured and clear scale staying in rhythm all the way to the bottom. On this down bow on the low string, we hear a crunch at the beginning of the note. This is because the violinist came from too high in the air down onto the string, and that slamming of the bow onto the string created that crunching sound. So to get rid of this, we want to make sure that we are just placing the bow on the string, not dropping it, so that we only hear pitch and no crunch. This section should have had, in the last about 10 seconds, much more dynamic contrast and a much more stable rhythm. The way that they just played it, every note was about the same volume and the rhythm wasn't stable enough to really pick up on a true pulse of this music.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

However, his movement overall feels a little bit stiff and staccato for the movement technique. He really would benefit from loosening up his shoulders, his spine, and his pelvis so that he has a little bit more rhythmic texture and dynamic here in this performance. He also needs to loosen up his arm movements while he's engaging the arms choreographically. They feel a little bit stiff and sharp when a more natural, flowy quality would really be welcome here. As the dancer performs this jumping motion, it shows where his weaknesses are. As he's preparing for the jump, he really needs to bend those knees more and drop that pelvis back so he's able to get up quicker and also land softer, so he's bending the knees when he lands as well. His arm is kind of slicing through the air here, however, more attention to dynamic quality would really be welcome here. As well as a bit more energy in the movement overall, this jump feels like the music is building, like it should build as well. However, the movement feels a little bit out of touch with the music and he lacks a little bit of rhythmic embodiment. As the dancer starts with a pretty basic step touch side to side in this kind of lunging motion as he's alternating Slicing his arms down through the air He is struggling a bit to connect to the rhythm and completely embody the rhythm of the music However, he has a strong understanding of the movement vocabulary. He has a nice bend in his knees He has a lot of clarity in this straightened leg and he shows that he's able to perform both arm Choreography and leg choreography at the same time As the dancer transitions between steps, he does so in a way that lacks connection from one step to another. So this is an area of improvement for the dancer which would also help his overall dynamic and rhythmic embodiment here. As he's transitioning here from a basic salsa step moving forward into another movement moving to his side, he drops the first step pretty quickly rather than finishing that basic salsa step fully in order to transition into the next step. He just needs a little bit more rehearsal here, a little bit more clarity taking one step into the next. As the dancer performs a body roll here it would really benefit him to ground more deeply into the floor so he could loosen up his range of motion through his upper body and down through his pelvis. To ground more he would bend his knees more deeply and drop his pelvis back and also get a greater range of motion coming from the top of the head moving down through the spine, through the pelvis, and back through the butt which would help this body roll not only dynamically but also appear more full. Right now it appears he's doing it kind of at a half speed it's a little bit one note so if you were to really loosen up particularly the spine and the pelvis it would take this performance to the next level. Here the dancer is demonstrating a fairly basic salsa step moving forwards and backwards in the space. Here he demonstrates again that he has a pretty strong hold over the movement vocabulary here. He also demonstrates that he's able to use his arms effectively and incorporate arm choreography along with lower body and leg choreography. He would benefit from dropping the pelvis back a little bit more and opening up his range of motion in the pelvis to add a little bit of polyrhythm and rhythmic texture or dynamic here. So overall he has clear movements and has a strong understanding of the movement technique.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So he has right foot, left foot, right foot, right hand, left foot. So he's opted to pose, but he could kind of twist in, you know, flag this foot out even further, his right foot. But it just seems like he's kind of placing his feet on the holds. He's not cutting his feet, but he's just kind of placing the feet and then pulling through his arms. So now we can see he chooses not to do the backflag. Instead he matches feet onto this and flags the left foot out. He could have just stuck the left foot there, backflag the left foot and saved himself from having to make a foot swap. He's still pretty bent in with the arms. So overall I think he's kind of climbing more with his upper body and not utilizing his feet as well. And now with this, you can do the same thing that he was doing before. So now he's done the foot swap. He could bring this knee up and over. So he's kind of pulling straight down through that foot or pushing straight down and then aggressively flag the left foot out and kind of twist his torso. Twist his torso into his arm a little bit, into his forearm and bicep. And really twist and bring that right hip into the wall and kind of sit on top of that hold. So he kind of starts the row with his arms locked off a little bit. His legs are a little bit bunched, so I think what he could have done is taken a little bit more pressure to his left foot and tried to get his left knee a little bit over top, so that way he's kind of applying his force straight through that hold. Then kind of sink his hips down, bring this right foot a little bit more to the left as well, so that way he can kind of straighten these arms out and kind of drive through the feet. It seems like he kind of just pulls a little too hard with his arms and causes his feet to rip off, cutting his feet and they hit the ground and he's off the route. But instead he kind of relies on the arms, his hips and feet really don't change position as he grabs this next right hand hold. He kind of just engages more with that left arm, so he's pretty locked off here. So he's really climbing heavily with his upper body and not really driving through his lower body. You can see even as he makes his first move, he's kind of really making it from his arms. His leg looks appears to be in the same position with his knee kind of sticking out. So if he didn't adjust the knee in the first move, he could adjust the knee and bring it to the left over more and really sink down through that foot. Maybe driving through that foot, get his weight over that foot. And that could kind of let him go into a backflip and move the right foot.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

As well as thinking of another way of placing the hands on that small hueco, so the climber has an easier time transferring the grip over to the high hold. As we can see, the type of hold the climber was reaching up to has many grooves, so the climber must think exactly at what groove he would like to apply the fingertips at. Since the fingertips once meeting the small edges, he will have to create friction in order to sustain the open hand grip. Here we can see the climber has brought the right toe to be placed at the same pinch hold that the climber was sustaining at the initial grip. The thumb has moved to the right side of the hold the moment that the climber engaged on placing the foot and now the foot is pushing down against a hold to create pressure and the hand in this instance is pulling towards the foot hold. In this case the climber in order to create this he needs to first secure the toe placement and apply sufficient pressure so once the climber gets to push away to the left side that means that the climber has applied sufficient pressure in that way the climber then can take the hand out of its placement for the next hold. Once the climber places the feet onto the wall, then the climb will start. As we can see, the right foot is placed the highest and of the two holds, it would be ideal if the climber moves the left hand out of the placement. This is because it doesn't seem a hold that the climber could sustain for a long time, comparatively from the right hand. Before the climber was able to apply pressure at the grip that he sent the left hand above for, he has lost pressure down at the right foot. The left leg was extended and coming into a flag in position so that the climber was able to tap the toe to apply extra pressure when going out for the reach. But due to the climber's right foot coming out of place, the climber announced center of gravity is coming down with it. As we can see the climbers are struggling on placing both hands on the sharp edge. This because the climbers right hand is pushing over to the left to sustain the hold. The reason why the climbers shoulders and he's trying to push away to the left side to apply pressure. This will tire the climbers arm due to the climber having to maintain a bend on the elbow to create pressure. And on the other hand we can see how it's placed at the bottom so this one is actually pulling down in order to sustain the grip. This can be compensating on the arms for the climber and the reason why he must make the move quickly out of the hold. The climber once he extends the right leg by pressing down on the foot then he will be able to release the hand to go opt for the next move. However one hand is almost above the other so thinking about his move and his position he must release the left hand which is underneath and may be complicated to release once the climber makes the move. Here we can see the climber making hand gestures is because he is visualizing what the sequence will be, meaning what to expect on the route and when to make the hand placement and how to. So it's important the climber makes this looking at it and studying it from the ground before he gets onto the wall. The climber has released the right hand to bring the hand over to a match on the same hueco edge. So in this case before the climber made that movement, he had released the left foot and is now out away from the wall. This so the climber was able to transfer over the weight and pressure to the highest foot. And also keeping the leg extended or not in any footholds will help the climber to transfer the weight at the same time keep balance. So he needed to apply sufficient pressure down at the leg once releasing the foot as well as applying sufficient friction and power at the grip above. The climber has made a move to a small hueco. The hueco means that there is a small lip that's thin so the climber places the fingers into the hold and now the climber is glancing over at the feet. It's important that he does this because he needs to be careful when making the foot switch as he will need to create extra pressure on the grips to release some of the pressure down at the feet when making the foot switch. The climbers is starting at a two hand hold start. The right hand being a pinch and the left hand being a very shallow hold Which potentially could be a crimp Where we can see the left hand has the knuckles sticking out and it tells me that the climbers engaging the fingertips against the wall and the small lip of the hold Or edge of the hold in order to sustain it. For the left grip the climber must Remain under it and keep the elbow as close as he can to the wall This to engage pressure to the hold and for the pinch hold on the right hand the climber must engage a lot of force into that thumb to create a clamping motion in order to sustain the hold and pull away from the wall to maintain pressure", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Most of her back is vertically aligned but her neck or her cervical spine is on a diagonal angle instead, leaning forward. And it should rather be continuing that vertical straight line. This is another example where the dancer extends her arms fully. Both arms are extended in completely straight lines. However, she shows a really large range of flexibility here. She is arching her back very far with her head dipping very far back at a low diagonal angle. The dancer shouldn't be leaning so far forward here.

They're not able to really include their arms in a way choreographically that's more advanced, and they're also struggling to stay consistently connected to the rhythm. Here is the dancers performing some more basic movements with their partner, going in and out of holding hands and being close, and then from moving further away while staying connected to one another. The dancer demonstrates that they're able to kind of grasp these basic movements in a way where they seem confident. They're staying connected to the rhythm, particularly through their footwork, and they're engaging their arms in choreographic ways that make sense for the movement. Overall, they're bending their knees slightly, they're dropping back through their pelvis slightly, and they maintain a slight groundedness, which is really helping them here. As a dancer begins through some basic partner steps with their partner here, they are demonstrating maybe a very beginner understanding of the movement language. However, they're really struggling to connect to the rhythm and perform the movement full out. They're taking very small steps around themselves, they're performing movements in kind of a staccato way that's not quite appropriate for the movement vocabulary, and overall are struggling to really perform this movement. As the dancer begins to perform some more higher tempo movements, they're able to move very quickly and efficiently in this increased tempo because they're really dropping the pelvis back and bending the knees, which is grounding them in their movement and showing that they're more confident the longer that they perform this movement. As the dancer continues to perform this movement, they appear to get more confident. They're finding a lot of clarity, particularly in their footwork, and they've got kind of a bouncing momentum happening, especially in their upper body, which while it's not necessarily deeply connecting to the rhythm, it is keeping them connected to the music. The dancer goes in and out of familiarity with the movement vocabulary as it appears here.

So, instead of raising his legs in order to control it, he's using his chest to be able to do that. You can see that the ball is contacting him here, higher in the chest, where he's going to provide a cushion for the ball to fall down towards his legs to be able to then continue to juggle it. How he's doing that, pretty simple. You can see that one foot is actually slightly behind the other foot and that's good from like a balance perspective. If his feet were side by side and he was leaning backwards like he is in this picture with his body to present the surface, it would make him off balance. So, this is good that one foot, the feet are staggered in this sense and the knees are bent and the torso is sort of leaning backwards here to present a surface that as the ball comes down is a little bit more flat when it hits it. The other thing that he's doing is his right arm is out, his left arm is slightly out at the angle. It's kind of hard to tell, but what he's doing is try to make a bigger surface area with his chest here by making his arms go wider. So, we would want players to do that for the right surface area. And the other thing that he's doing is as the ball hits here, he should be exhaling to then cushion the ball a little bit with his chest to get it down. But in very good body control on this moment when he's making contact with the ball. Good picture. This is with the outside of the foot that he's hitting the ball. And again, really similar to when he hits it with the inside of the ball that we previously just saw is that he's meeting the ball higher than his knee height. Again, he's meeting the ball higher as opposed to lower when he's just normally juggling with the top of his foot. So he's meeting the ball higher. He's externally rotating his hip so that now he can present the outside of his foot and a nice flat surface. You can see that his ankle is locked. That's going to create a nice hard surface. If the ankle was loose, it might not give the ball enough force as he contacts it. So here, that's a really good picture of what we would want someone to look like when he's doing that. The other thing again with his body is that he's not leaning like this direction because he's externally rotating his hip and using the outside of his foot. He's still straight up. So he shows good flexibility in his hip to be able to rotate and get to this position. His foot is allowing him to stay completely in balance on the support leg and he's tracking the ball with his eyes again, not looking anywhere else. So he's fully focused and concentrated on the action that he's trying to accomplish. Again, an extremely good picture here of what contacting the ball with the outside of your foot juggle should look like. I want to show the moment of impact when he's juggling the ball and just maintaining it at maintaining a hip height level in terms of the height of the ball. This is just the posture in terms of how he strikes it. So you can see that his foot is contacting the ball almost directly underneath the center, not to the side, which would then, if you hit it on the sides, it's going to force the ball to go in one direction or the other. He's contacting the ball just underneath the center of the ball, which is great. And he's also hitting the ball with a foot that's not completely, his toe's not completely straight like this. It's slightly bent upwards, but he's contacting it with the bone, sort of like almost like midfoot just below the toe box, which is great because it's going to pop the ball up into the air. It's a really nice hard surface for him to push the ball up this direction. If he was hitting it with the same surface, but his toe was more pointed down, the ball would go out this direction here. So he's giving the ball the intention of where he wants to go with how he's hitting it with his foot. The other thing that you can see is at the moment of contact, he is slightly bent over the ball and his eyes are looking down at the ball. So he's very clearly focused on what he's looking at here. Total control and total balance of this moment here and the execution of this is a really good level. This is another technique that he uses that he does very well here actually. And this is, he's meeting the ball higher in the air again, more hip height, by raising his foot up from the ground as opposed to contacting the ball down here. So the concept is exactly the same as any surface when he's making, when he's trying to just keep the ball up into the air here with literally probably no spin on the ball, he just has to come meet it at a higher point from the ground. And it also, you see that his foot surface that he's presenting is more like this, but he's contacting directly underneath the ball, but with the bone that's behind the toe box and away from the ankle. So sort of like almost a little bit mid foot on top of the foot here. And that's just going to force the ball to just pop straight up into the air here. So the angle of which his foot is making contact is perfect for the ball to go up into the air. And even with no spin, we would try to teach players in this moment to not spin the ball back towards them. If his toe was more pointed up like that, it could force the ball to come back to him with a lot of spin. So this is why it's really important, the positioning of his foot and where he's contacting the ball directly underneath the middle of this will allow it to go straight up. He is slightly reaching for this ball, but I think it's okay. I mean, his support leg is still bent here in this position. He's slightly leaned back. I would like to see him be a little bit more upright or even a little bit more forward with his upper body torso. But he's using his arms for good balance and he has really good touch and technique that will allow him to recover from this position. So, this is one of the few errors that he made throughout the video, but he lost control of the ball here using his thigh. Like we said in the previous example, that he was using the space just behind kneecap. So more this region here, that's more of the musculature of the thigh muscle here, and it can provide a cushion. What happened in this picture actually is that he just hit the ball off of the front of his knee, and what that's doing then is sending the ball out into this direction here away from his body, where he'll either have to chase it to keep it up in the air, or it's going to hit the ground. So, the contact surface here is what was incorrect in this moment, of just, he needs to hit the ball more towards the center, just behind the kneecap to provide the cushion to be either able to push the ball back up into the air here, or drop the ball down to his feet. The subject in the activity is performing a juggling exercise where he's being required to lift the ball from the ground, off the ground with his feet, get it up into the air, then keep the ball in the air for as long as possible using any surface of his body in order to do so. What you're looking at here in this picture is what we would teach is the correct starting position as he gets into the exercise. So his foot that he is going to pull the ball back with is placed on top of the foot, as you can see here, in the center of the ball as well. And it's out in front of his body, so he extends his leg to get out there and then he's supporting, so using his support foot underneath just to maintain balance. He's in good posture, he's not leaning backwards or to the side, he's in a good balance here. So total control from a starting position and from here he can pull the ball back and lift it up into the air and go from there. Here, what we see the subject doing is using his thigh to be able to control the ball. This is a good resource to help get the ball back down to your feet if the ball is above head height and then falling because it's at the halfway point. So what he's doing a nice job of is bringing his knee up, upward, just raising his knee, like almost like he's marching. And he's just creating a flat enough surface. You can see his knee is, his leg or his thigh is almost slightly still tilted a little bit downward at an angle. It's not the other way, which would be that if he brought his knee way up high like this, at this angle, then it would force the ball back towards him in that direction. So because he's not bringing his knee all the way up and there's still that angle, he doesn't really need to provide a lot of force on the ball. It's more of a cushion and the cushion will allow it to just drop then down to his feet to get it back down to here. And if he's not comfortable, then he can begin juggling sequence over again between right and left foot, et cetera. So this is a really good resource to be able to use. As far as the technique is concerned, he's executing this at a really good level where he's presenting the right contact surface of the ball just behind the kneecap. That's the soft part of the thigh, the muscly part of the thigh, as opposed to the bony part of the thigh and your knee, which would force the ball to go in multiple directions. So this is quite good, what he's presenting here. And then obviously his balance is really good again, slightly bent over in the upper torso, tracking the ball with his eyes. Hands are slightly out to the side to provide support and balance to him. Support knee, slightly bent. So he's very stable as he makes contact with the ball in this picture. So, he's pretty playful in terms of the surfaces that he can use to control the ball and he can strike the ball with to keep it in the air while he's juggling. Here he's using the inside of his foot to be able to lift the ball about chest height and then it should fall back down to the next one here on the other side. So how he does that again is he's contacting the ball a little bit higher. When he's just juggling hip height, the ball is a little bit lower where he's contacting it here because he's using the inside of his foot. He has to open up his hip and bring his foot up this direction to sort of meet the ball at a good place. That way the surface that he's hitting with his foot is flat because it's the inside of his foot. So the moment that he contacts it below the ball will help the ball go straight up and straight down. So that's why he has to come meet the ball much higher here. Again, showing a really good balance with his upper body and his torso, like total control, eyes are focused in terms of what he's trying to do, plant foot slightly underneath him, which means he's in good balance. So again, great contact point here, which should allow the ball to go straight up in the air. Really good picture here of this technique. So at the beginning of the exercise here, what you're seeing is his ability to keep control of the ball below waist height or at or below waist height here. So he's not putting a lot of power on the ball and putting it high up in the air. He's only putting enough force into the ball to keep it at this height. So what you just saw was that he was able to contact the ball underneath it with the correct surface to get it to where he wants to get to. But in addition to that, the ball is traveling between his right and his left foot. So it's going up. He's given a direction going in this direction here. It's getting about halfway up his height here. And now it's going to fall down onto his opposite leg here on his right leg here so that he can then just alternate feet right and left and right and left. And so this is a really good, we would recommend that you try to do this as much as you can, as opposed to just staying on one foot, unless that was the instruction of the activity for him. He's alternating feet, showing proficiency with both and hitting the ball with the right amount of force to keep it completely under control. And his body is totally in control. You can see that his knees are slightly bent. He's a little bit leaning over, so he's not leaning backwards to the side. He's in very good balance. His eyes are focused completely on the ball. This is a very good posture for him to be able to juggle the ball effectively and keep it in the air.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So as she's doing this we can kind of see that she's allowing herself to be in a straight arm position initially right here. And this is kind of a good thing by allowing herself to hang over to the right. This is able to allow her to transfer her body weight over to the left and then kind of push herself up in the direction that she needs to go. However what I'm noticing is that as she's kind of swinging herself from left to right in this starting position here, she's hanging in a straight arm position on the far right and then as she starts going to the left she naturally just starts pulling her body in with her upper body. So this is kind of a reverse way that she wants to think. And instead I would actually encourage the clamber to really focus on keeping her arms straight from left to right and focusing on how much her body is transitioning over that left foot because that left foot is going to be the biggest thing that can help her to get up to this yellow hold that she's aiming for. And so here we can see that as the climber is reaching out for that left hand hold that she's aiming for we can see That what her left leg is doing is that her knee is pointed straight in into the wall And so as that happens that actually helps to push her hip away from the wall And so when her hip is getting pulled away from the wall It actually makes the distance that her left hand has to travel a little bit further And it also doesn't allow her to really transfer her body weight over that left foot Which forces her to have to rely on how much she's pulling with her right arm So this does make the movement a little bit harder for her to complete", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He lacks the proper control of the ball and wanting the ball to go in a direction that we want it, which is straight. So now he's trying to overcompensate for this elbow being out and now he's trying to push the ball with his wrist and his hands and he's overcompensating for the fact that his elbow is in the wrong, is at the wrong degrees and is pointing outwards. So it's really important that we get this elbow in straight and aligned to the basket on our shot. Otherwise, when the elbow is pointed out like that, it's really hard for us to control our shot and be consistent in making the ball go straight. When our elbow is out like that, it's hard to control the shot and make it go straight. Now we're more susceptible for the ball to go flying off to the right or off to the left depending on how the ball comes off our fingertips. We're not really in control of that. So we really need to make sure that that elbow is in and not flaring out. If we take a look at the shooter's knees, as he's bending down his knees are coming way over his toes. So this is very bad balance. When we're bending down our knees should not be coming over our toes. It puts a lot of stress on your knees. Also shooting this way can cause knee problems. So we definitely don't want to do that. In order to correct this, he needs a wider base. So by him putting his left foot in front of his right foot and instead of his feet being so this close together we separate his feet a little more to make them a little bit more spread. The placement of your feet as far as like how close or far apart they are is all dependent on the shooter's body mechanics. There are people who have their feet a little bit closer together and they're able to bend down and go up without their knees going over the front of their toes because their body mechanics allow it and it's comfortable for them. There's other people who need to have their feet further apart. It's about finding what's most comfortable for you as a shooter that works with your own body mechanics in order to create the best shot for you. you take a look at his feet you can see that his feet are nice and even and it doesn't have one foot in front of the other and as he's a left-handed shooter because his feet are even together he will need to have the shoulder flexibility to make sure that his elbow is not in I mean excuse me, it's not pointing out but it's actually pointing in if you can see from this view you see the angle of his arm is going this way so his elbow is flaring out so he naturally doesn't have that shoulder mobility to keep that elbow in when his feet are lined up perfectly like that the vast majority of people who shoot a basketball do not have that shoulder mobility so in order to not to overcompensate but in order to make up for that to where it's more of a natural feel to keep that elbow in straight you want that left foot to be slightly in front so you have the left foot since he's shooting with the left hand you want his left foot slightly in front and his right foot slightly behind just that little adjustment in that alignment will take the angle of our elbow going this way and it will change it to being more at this angle obviously we would like to be perfectly straight like this but if it's has a little bit of a bend like this that's fine that's good that's all we're aiming for but this angle right here that means the elbow is out way too much and so our release is not going to be as effective as we need it to be to be a consistent shooter On this shot attempt we take a look at the follow through of his left hand. You can see his fingers are pointing in this direction. We need for those fingers to be pointing in the direction of the basket. Where it's due to follow through and our fingers on the follow through are pointing away from the basket it typically means that as the ball is rolling out of our fingertips we don't have full control of the ball or it may have just slipped out of his hand in that particular shot attempt. But now if the follow through is consistently like this we have to make that adjustment. If it's not a one-time thing we have to make an adjustment and make sure that after the follow through his fingers are pointing in the direction of the basket or pointing down to the ground on the follow through but still the back of his wrist is pointing towards the basket and all of his fingers, the back of his fingers are pointing towards the basket and not away from the basket in this direction or away from the basket in that direction. We take a look at his guy hand. It's a really good guy hand. There's no interference. There's no pushing of the ball with his thumb or any of the fingers. He perfectly just let the ball slide out of his hand. So for his shot, his guy hand is really good. The issue is that follow through and the fingers pointing away and to the left. When we take a look at his hand placement, you can see his right hand is nice on the side of the ball. You can see his index finger on his left hand, his shooting hand, is right there in the middle of the ball. If you take a look at his thumbs from his right hand on the guy hand, and you take this right here, it has this nice good, what we call, this is the L and then the T right here. We can get this formation with our hands, where we have on our shooting hand, our index finger and extend it out to the thumb, creates an L. Then from our guy hand, from our thumb down to the base, to the middle portion of our wrist, and then we extend it out here from our thumb on our shooting hand, that creates a T. So we did a good job of creating that L-T with the placement of our hands, so he has really good hand placement for the jump shot.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Good sitting position from what I can tell. The chair's not high enough for the stand itself is too tall. You can see that the arms need to come up to the fingerboard. Collapsed finger here as well.

And so to have those fingers so far away creates a long lever arm, which makes it really difficult to push down those keys with efficiency without getting tired. And so her whole hand is just not playing the instrument with the best leverage that she could possibly have. And pulling those fingers in and that palm rounded would be really, really helpful for her to loosen up this hand and play with a clear, more weighted sound. That takes less energy. Yeah, just place the song too fast. Like, put on a metronome, play slower. Really time those hands together. Having to change the tempo all the time in order to make it feel like you're actually playing a tune, just ill-advised, slow down the tempo here so that you can really get a good sync and coordination between each hand.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Would love maybe to see his feet a little further apart. He's a little under the basket, but he's ready. He's a big guy that he could probably get this rebound, but let's be more balanced, maybe stagger those feet on the landing. Same thing here. Great lift, footwork, pushing off that left foot, right knee up. Here you can see he's so high up on the backboard. He's a tall guy, but soft touch, the balls coming off the pads of the fingers, high on that square. Nice job. Again, beautiful step here with the left foot, followed by the right. He brings that guide hand on the side, being really strong with it here. He doesn't have to look at it. Eyes and head are up, looking at where he wants to go in the target. Again, beautiful look here of the extension. Look at that right knee and hip lift, arm bar, eyes and head are up. Beautiful extension of the ball here. Again, great lift, arm bars up, eyes and head are up, beautiful extension, the ball leaves the fingertips. High on the glass. Love how he begins this drill with a stepping of the right foot. He steps on that right foot and he doesn't even dribble it. He's got a right foot plant, balls in two hands, eyes and head are up. Again, great lift, push off here. He's got some space and air under there as he lifts. Arm bar, eyes and head up, beautiful extension of the right shooting arm. Again, nice step, nice, covers a lot of space here with no dribble. You don't need a dribble, but going to push off that left foot, great distance covered here. He's, I mean, he's got long legs. He's going to bring that right leg behind. He's got two hands on the ball. You know, it is a little low, but he, but because he's got two hands on the ball, he's being very strong with it. You know, it'd be hard for maybe a defender to get it if he's got two hands on it. But look how he's looking to where he's going. He's not looking down. He's not looking elsewhere. He's looking at the basket. Again, look how when he finishes, both shoulders are square to the backboard. He's not turned one way or the other, but his body is in line facing the basket. And both his feet are elevating. Great lift here. The ball's touching the top of that square, has a really good chance of going in. Again, great lift, arm bar comes off as he releases it. But again, look at how his fingers are spread. That's really good. The ball comes off those pads of those fingers. Nice, soft touch. Beautiful execution here of the reverse layup. Steps on that left foot, raises that right leg and knee high. He had two hands on the ball, but you could see that guide hand come off as he lifts the ball or gets ready to shoot the ball with his right hand. Eyes and head are up. Beautiful spacing here in relation to the backboard. Textbook here, beautiful extension, push off, lift of that right knee, arm bar up to protect the ball from a defender. Beautiful lift here of the shooting arm and head. Again, beautiful footwork, push-off, extension, arm bar, eyes and head up on the target, great hand placement. The ball, I mean he's got his hand kind of on the side, but he's got such great elevation height that's okay. Again, really great pulling of the right leg and knee up. Push off of that left foot, extended, all coming off the balls of your feet. Raising those hips. Love that his arm bar is here. You want that there, in case there's a defender, you've got your body between the defender and the ball. So that defender would have to come across your body to try to block it. Therefore, you may draw a foul, or the defender doesn't get to the ball at all. Here is a great look of how he's got both hands on the ball. No dribble, but going off the left, pulling the right, he raises the ball for the shot with both hands, with his right hand behind the ball, that guide hand is there on the left, just to help get it up there, to help keep it supported, to protect it. That's a strong, aggressive move. The next step would be on his left foot. So right foot, left foot, pull the right leg up, two hands on the ball, that guide hand, non left hand shooting hand is on the side. It helps to lift it. His eyes and head are up. Very strong athletic example of a reverse layup. Again, great lift and elevation off the ground. Good extension of the body. We, you know, would love to see this arm bar maybe up a little higher, but great extension of the shooting arm. Eyes and head are up on the right side.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Now when she's turning in the opposite direction, she's turning counterclockwise and once again she remains with her eyes focused where they should be. Again, the dancer's arms are used well up and down here, alternating. What you could also do to improve this step is engaging her shoulders so that they too move up and down with her arms moving up and down. The dancer is using her hips in opposition of her feet, so when she steps with her left foot, her hips are moving to her right. That's very good, she's using them well and it's very fluid. What she can improve on is moving her hips even more, so her hips can be pushed over to this right side to even a greater extent, so that it's even more visible, but she is doing a good job of engaging her hips here. The dancer doesn't finish distinctly. She goes into some salsa steps in place, but then turns her body to the side to show that she is finished. It would be better for her to finish completely, either having her feet together and her hands down while looking forward so that she just makes it clear and distinct that she is finished and doesn't fade into being finished instead. Just having a harsh stopping point where it's clear. The dancer's focus and her eyes are very good. She's remained with her eyes at eye level the entire time, staring straight ahead. And this is true also as she turns, she spots straight forward so she doesn't get dizzy and that her eyes pan horizontally across in the ego view as well. So we know that she has her focus straight forward, which allows her spine to be vertically aligned. Again, the dancer is using her hips here, moving them horizontally as she taps her feet forward. She could be moving her hips even more, and while she's doing so, she also can be doing the same with her shoulders, either sideways or up and down, just so that there is more movement in her entire body here. The dancer catches the rhythm very well, stepping with her foot down on count one exactly. She does not miss a musical cue and she starts right on time. The dancer could shift her weight further onto her toes, especially as she does the dance steps across, open, and then crossing over, and again, open and crossing over. Her weight can be further shifted onto her toes so that her footwork is more articulate and distinct. The dancer is using her arms correctly, alternating one higher and lower, dependent upon the foot that she's stepping or using on. She's alternating them up and down fluidly. The dancer stepping in rhythm, stepping on counts one, two, three, holding count four, stepping on counts five, six, seven, holding count eight. These pauses on counts four and eight is very common in salsa dancing and she is completely in rhythm here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This helps the player's hips stay open when they want to shoot the ball to the right hand side. A challenge though is that this can give the goalkeeper an idea of which way they are going to go. The player has begun their final step into the ball. The distance is large, as they are pushing off their right foot. They are generating enough power so that their left foot can land by the side of the ball. This final step into the ball will allow them to generate more power when they swing through and strike the ball. The player's final step, their right hip is rotating through already. This is to help them strike the ball on the side and place the ball in the window of the net. Players arms should be further out for balance. Players able to make this action because they're not travelling at that great of a speed. If they were going faster, we would need their arms to be out further. body shape leaning back slightly eyes are focused on the ball contact with the inside of the foot in the direction which you want the ball to go The contact on the ball is with the inside of the foot, right on the midline of the ball. Contact is good and the direction and accuracy into the goal is good. The player has begun the execution of the shot. Non-kicking foot placement pointing in the direction that they want the ball to go. Left foot also planted by the side of the ball. Eyes are still focused on the ball. The player has struck the ball low and into the bottom corner of the goal. This is positive because it is very difficult for the goalkeeper to get into that area without guessing. Outcome of the strike is the ball hitting the window of the net, a good finish, making it difficult for the goalkeeper to reach. Non-kicking foot placement good. Hips, toes, all pointing towards the target. contact on the ball, on the inside of the foot. If the player uses their laces, they could generate more power. The player's body shape helps them maintain balance as the right leg crosses over with their follow through. Left arm counterbalances that. Right arm is out at the back. That helps them stay balanced as they lean away from the strike. Player's non-kicking foot is facing the center of the goal. This still allows the player's hips to rotate. Contact on the ball to put it in the left side. The player is striking the ball into the left side of the goal. Their run-up is slightly closer to a central line, only slightly off. This will help the player's hips turn and rotate in order to strike the ball in the left side. The player is leaning back away from the ball and then also a little bit right to left. This body shape will help the player get underneath the ball and strike the ball in the air. The outcome of the shot is slightly off the window of the net, which is where we would like the ball to be. Player's arms are further out for balance. This helps with the large step that they've taken into the ball as their final step. The player's body shape has remained open, their contact has come under the ball. This action will allow the ball to go higher and up into the top corner areas, which are very preferable. The players approach to the ball is at 45 degrees off centre. This helps their hips face the direction they want to have the ball travel. The player has followed through with the ball and their striking leg has begun to come across their body. This is normal. The player uses their arms to help counteract the right to left motion of their leg by having a left to right motion of their arm. This helps them stay balanced. Players executed their final step into the ball. Their non-kicking foot is planted by the side of the ball, pointing in the direction that it wants to go. This time they have a bigger step and a bigger swing with their right leg to come through the ball. This will generate more power upon contact. Outcome of the strike, the ball doesn't quite hit the window of the net. We would like the ball to hit the window of the net to make it difficult for the goalkeeper to save. The player's follow-through is straight and leading towards the target. This is possible when swinging through at a slow speed. If the player was swinging through at a faster speed, this wouldn't be possible. and outcome ball is close to the window of the net. This is okay, but we would like the ball to hit the window, making it more difficult for the goalkeeper to reach. The player would be better to have a bigger step into the ball. That final big step will help to open up their hips, bringing their striking leg further back, allowing it a larger swing range in order to generate more power as it goes through the ball. The player struck through the ball with their right foot. They followed through and across their body. This means that they've actually struck all the way through the ball, which is what we want. Left arm has swung in the opposite direction to the leg. This helps the player remain balanced. The player's right arm is turned backwards, also helping maintain balance as they finish off the action sequence.

As the dancer transitions from one step to the next, swinging her arm in a pendulum motion in front of her, she struggles through this transition to keep connected to the rhythm as well as to find clarity in her movement. Overall, she would just benefit from some additional rehearsal, finding a little bit more clarity and precision in both her arm and her leg movement. As the dancer begins with some basic salsa movement, she demonstrates an understanding of the movement vocabulary, even if at a more beginner level. She's able to incorporate her arms choreographically in a way that's clear and appropriate for the movement technique, and is finding a lot of nice clarity in her footwork as well. She would benefit from bending her knees more, dropping her pelvis back, and being more grounded in her movement overall, as well as activating a greater range of motion in her pelvis and through her upper body. As the dancer performs this turning sequence around herself, she would really benefit from spotting her head more, especially more consistency and with more consistency and clarity, which would help her to move more quickly and efficiently through this turning sequence and help her to stay more deeply connected to the rhythm. She's including her arms in a way that's clear and has a fair amount of precision, however she would benefit from extending them more deeply above her head. She would also benefit from bending her knees more so she's able to move more quickly and efficiently and finding clarity in her footwork. As the dancer performs the circular undulation or isolation of her shoulder, she has a lot of nice movement here in her shoulders, her chest, and her torso in general.

Right now the climber is overcompensating the grips as he is engaging the core to sustain the swing. Here the climber is glancing over to the grip and as he's doing this he's going by feel bringing the left toe into place. This one he makes a match where the limbs on that same initial hold on the undercling has been and in order to release the right foot he must apply pressure on the left toe coming into place. Now that the climber is positioned, we can see how the climber needs to continually apply pressure onto both of the grips. In the top grip, the climber is leaning on the hold in order to apply pressure. For the undercling, the climber will need to pull the hold towards him. In this case, the climber is making the foot placement at the wall. The left foot is on the foot chip and the climb will start until the climber's right foot is off the ground. If the climber was going to attempt this climb again, he needs to make sure that he minimizes the amount of transitions or moves in the wall. In this case, for him it was a waste of time when he decided to do the original foot placement when he had already spent time doing a foot switch. This took away from the climber having energy on the upper body as he was engaging on a close pull up when making the foot switch. Once he was on the purple grip, we can see how the climber's left toe has slipped out of the hold. It's important that the climber once had made the reach that he applies that pressure that he had before coming off from the wall, but also maintains pressure at the toe placement so that the climber doesn't swing out of the wall. Here the climber makes the reach up to the block and in this one he has to keep an open-handed and brings the grip to come into closure at the corner of the block. Now it's important that the climber brings the outer side of the hand to come and meet with the wall so that the climber is able to get more surface onto the grip. In this case the climber needs to also once applying pressure he needs to apply pressure that is accurate to sustain the grip by leaning on the hold. In this case when the climber was going for the next move being the purple block he needed to keep his right side towards the wall. He does this by keeping the right leg extended going on a flag and this helps the climber to have balance and a civility when going for the reach. Having the leg extended helps the climber keep his right side towards the wall as he would need to keep his center of gravity close to the wall to make it easy when the climber brings the upper grip onto a placement. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet to make sure that he does an accurate foot placement. In this case, the climber brings the right foot to come into place before the left foot is being released. This one, the climber has to tip toe on the hold in order to smear out and make the placement of the toe having friction against the hold before he releases the foot. That way he avoids from peeling off the wall. And at this moment to make the foot transition, he must pull tighter on the grips to release some of the pressure down at the feet. Here we can see the climber shaking his hands. This he does because it will help release any tension that may be build up in the hands as well as warming up the hands before going to climb. The climber was able to make the reach out with the left hand to a pinch, meaning that the climber places the thumb on the other side while the fingers are placed on the opposite side so that the climber is able to pinch onto the hold to clamp the grip. The climber now lays pressure on the hold while securing the grip by leaning back and as we can see the climber has sent his right leg to a higher stance in order to make the reach when transitioning the left hand from the undercling to the pinch hold. The climber is bringing his right toe to come into place at the same hold. When both of the limbs are in the same hold, this is called matching and the climber will have to engage pressure on the toe once being placed on top of the hold by pushing down while the climber continuously pulls on the undercling hold. Now when the climber releases the left foot, he will need to bring it into a high placement in order to release the left hand from the hold. The climber is approaching the wall and there is a two hand hold start. Both of the holds are different. The right hand has a bigger hold and seems to be a jug as the climber is able to place the hand at the edge of the lip and wraps the fingers behind the edge. In the left hand, we can see how the climber is placing the hand, copped onto the edge of the hold. This is a jug that is upside down and the type of grip that the climber is applying is by sliding the fingers behind the lips of the hold. In order to activate the gripping power, the climber will need to pull the grip towards him.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Yeah, and so as he kind of does this he's you can see him kind of moving left to right So his goal is to kind of move Get his weight to the right foot and over the right foot so that we can kind of spring up Go for this a green hold And it looks like he's doing everything correct to me.

I think this is where he just needs To get a little bit more vertical on it or just get there a little faster.

And they're got their left foot down here. I guess trying to get a little higher on the wall. And here you have the climber attempting to get their foot into the other start hold. The issue with this is they're actually further away from this green hole than they were. This is a well-forced dyno. The climber is trying to do something. Either way, they're gonna have to jump. And this is objectively a more difficult position to jump out of than just simply firing out of the start position, but the climber is trying it. And I commend them for trying something different, although this is not going to be more effective than just doing what the route setters intend, which is ripping it to that jug.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The dancers lost their articulation of their feet when they were doing the turning sequence. So their footwork just got a bit misconstrued there. The dancers are in good rhythm and timing here, dancing 1, 2, 3, and 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. 1, 2, 3, and 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Or rock, step, triple step, rock, step, triple step. The dancer is using the space while traveling from the front of the room on a diagonal to the back of the room and then forward again, so using all the space in the studio at their disposal. The dancer's arms should be at level with their shoulders when they're pulling apart from each other. Right now his arms are low on a low diagonal but they should be in a straight horizontal line. The dancer is leading his steps forward here on his heel with his toe lifted off the ground, but he should never be stepping with his heel first, even though that is how we step pedestrianally when we walk. He should not be stepping like that when he is dancing. The dancer is looking down here. Instead of looking down at the floor, he should be looking straight ahead or at his partner. Whether the dancers are traveling to the right or to the left in and of itself or whether this is happening while they're turning, they still need to articulate all their footsteps. So each triple step should include three distinct steps. One, two, three, where on the second step the feet are coming together. The dancers are mirroring each other well, so when the dancer in the black is using his left foot, the dancer in the tan pants is using his right foot. So they are mirroring each other using opposite feet well here. Also the dancer's spine is misaligned here because his head is tilted on an angle. His head is tilted forward so his spine is on the vertical plane but then his upper spine is tilted so it's not in line because of him moving his head downward.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The way that the climber has placed both hands matching the hold are the left hand when it went up at first had the fingers slide into a pocket and because this is a triangle or shape hold there was a hole in there where the fingers slid in and there is an edge so the climber must be pulling himself in to the wall by bending the elbow and creating resistance for the grip as well as supported by the thumb that is on the top edge of the hold. Quickly the climber once has fully stepped on the left foot and keeps the leg extended for the stance. The climber then moves quickly to send the right hand up on the hold. This one being held from the top and the thumb over to where the entry of that pocket is on the hold. The climber has reached the top and must hold it for about 3 seconds before letting go and this is when the climber has achieved the problem. the climber was able to grab on to the top hold. This is a jug, so it's a very positive and promising hold to hold on to. But in order to get there, the climber first tried sending the right leg to a higher stance. Knowing to do that was compromising the grips that the climber was holding on tight before, which was right hand on the pinch and the left hand on what seems to be like a nub, where the hold is shallow and the climber brings the nub at the top ball of the palm and presses into the hold by placing the fingertips right between the wall and where the hold ends towards the wall. So there's a small indent down into the wall and that's where the climber digs in the fingertips to sustain the hold. Now, in order to sustain the hold, the climber has to pull forcefully on it. To create pressure on the grip. Same stance with the pinch and it's much more comfortable if the climber was leaning down on it. Same thing with the nub. Reason why the climber then chose to bring the right foot down and keeping the leg extended, that is called flagging in. So the climber, instead of flagging out to like control balance, this is a different type of balance, but it drives the center of gravity down. By doing this, the climber also applies more force to the left toe, which is already being in place and keeps his hips square for the climber tend to gain leverage by stepping up on the left foot, keeping the knee out. This helps also the climber to keep the right hip into the wall when dropping the right foot, which helps support the climbers staying close right side against the wall to help the reach. Here in order for the climber to achieve the highest grip on the pinch, the pinch is when the climber sends the fingers onto one side and the thumb onto the other to create a clamping motion to secure the grip. Since the pinch is vertical, the climber must apply pressure and friction by leaning on the hold. Now, the climber in order to also gain that height needed to step up on the highest foot and that foot was the left foot. In order to the climber gain leverage, couldn't go necessarily straight up from having the foot placement out left. So the climber needed to rock his hips over to the left side to create a stance that would be secured by applying that pressure on the toe. And then has, in order to bring himself over to the left side, the climber is also engaging the grip by making a pull down motion and keeping the elbow close to the body. At that instance, since the climber is transferring the weight from the lower foot to the highest foot, the right foot has already lost contact with the wall and instead is keeping the leg straight down to help the climber let drive his center of gravity out left and also to keep the right side of the hip towards the wall, which will help the climber when engaging at the reach on the right hand. One thing to note, not miss, is that the climber here was standing on the feet both but keeping a low stance kind of like in a squat even though having this position but tries to bring the left shoulder towards the wall. This to help the climber have a closer reach when letting go of the left hand so he can move that hand quickly while still looking at it to make a precise throw of his hand right onto the grid. Here, the climber has made it to the top hold. How the climber got there was first, the climber has moved the left hand through a series of moves, meaning at first was down in the placement by the hip, then was fully standing on his right foot. Quickly, after he got himself pulled in and shifted the weight over to the left foot, the climber then was holding on to the small edge and quickly had bumped up to the left to the top hold. This one, at that time, the right foot has come off from the hold down below and instead, the foot is helping with the leverage of the climber by pressing against the wall and also pushing the toe downwards, this to create some friction to assist the climber with the reach, even if the left foot is the one where the climber has shifted his weight in order to gain reach. Once the climber has reached the top and places the hands matching the hold for about 3 seconds, then the climber has finished the problem. Here the climber had to step up on the right foot while holding on to the left hand in order to establish the first position on the wall. This one to locate the right hand onto the sloper. Slopers are known to be held with the palm open and fingers spread out or cupped in. This the climber then for the right hand specifically needs to then create pressure on the hand due to needing to create friction since it's an open palm. And he does this by keeping the weight of the body on the grip above. Now the left hand that is being placed is a two hand hold start and the left hand we can see how he's comfortably leaning on it and has the grip with the fingers sliding behind the hold. This is called a jug. So far up to this point the climber has been going up a sequence on the pattern of alternative movement of hands and feet. Now in this case the climber in this moment is feeling is stuck meaning that now the handhold is too low and is close past his waist. This makes it difficult for the climber to hold on to especially because he has the left foot on a high placement and the leg is on the way. The climber in this time needs to forcefully be pushing down on the right foot and find a way to stabilize by edging his inner toe area into the wall like digging into it and tries to keep himself close by keeping the arm bended on the right hand. The type of hold of the climber when out left hand is a small chip. This is shaped with a small edge and almost gripped as a crimp but the thumb is slid onto the side to support the pinch. Now the climber is holding to it tightly but before this the climber was struggling down below with placing the foot the right position. This is potentially because the climber wasn't necessarily stepping on the toe but somewhere along the toe box on the inner area of the sole. In this case it's important that the climber can keep a right position for the foot as it's the one sustaining most of the weight of the climber when transferring on any of the points of contact on the wall. Here the climber has brought their left leg up. This one so that the climber can make a placement with the toe on the foot chip. The left leg was before extended out and it was used to for the climber to create balance when applying all of the pressure onto the highest foot which was before the right toe. As the climber needed to create pressure for the right hand grip.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He's testing the edges with his spatula by pushing it up under the edges and pulling it back out to see if they're loosened. And now he's using the handle to move the pan from side to side so that the oil can evenly distribute on the base of the pan. When the pan is hot or warm and the oil hits it, it instantly thins out enough. So it's very easy to do this without the need of any utensil. He's using his hands to remove the papery skin on the outside of the onion. Because he cut the stem end off, he has edges that he can pull from that makes that much easier. and he's turning down his heat. It is a pretty vigorous sounding heat level he has. He knows what he's doing but in more novice situations you may want to go a little less hot but he is working quickly which is good when when your pan is hot. Always a good idea if you're cutting a whole fruit or vegetable to go ahead and rinse it off right before you're cooking with it, especially if you're cutting with it because you want to make sure that any outside debris, dust, whatever may be stuck to it can come off before you start making your dish. If he were to kind of extend his culinary ability out to a more professional level, he would probably be using a chef's knife for this task. It's a lot easier to get through things with a chef's knife, but he is using sort of a multi-purpose utility knife that is specifically used often for vegetable cutting. At this point his omelet is complete, but he's going to flip it again. Now he's added his egg mixture to his pan and his pan is hot. You can hear it sizzles instantly. Those two ends will be discarded, not used in his food because they are tough and strange and don't have good texture or flavor. He's cutting the onion in half. He's taking his cutting board. He's gotten a small red onion. Now he's grabbing an egg. and removing the stem end of the onion. Now he's taking his onion placing it on the cutting board I do feel like he should secure this cutting board at the countertop because as he's moved about it's already shifted a little It's always safer to put something between the cutting board and the top of the countertop To keep that from happening. You can do a damp paper towel a damp towel That's thin just something that can anchor it down. So there's no cutting of yourself when it slides out from under you and now he's beginning to press his omelet. So that's not something you wanna do because when you press on it, you're actually deflating any air that it was able to get in the whisking process, which will make it more dense and less fluffy. He's using his knife to slide the cut onion into a bowl. And here he's placed his skillet over the heat on the stove. and now he's used his spatula to flip the omelet. When the omelet was on its single side, had he left it there and then folded or rolled it, it would become a French omelet. Once it's flipped in this way, it becomes more of something called a masala omelet, which is as this is made with uncooked vegetables whisked into your egg mixture or spices or both and then cooked on both sides. Now he's making small cross cuts on the green chili pepper. That's going to create a piece that pieces that are the same size as the onion pieces Which is always a good thing if you're cooking vegetables together a lot of times you do want those Sizes to be uniform so they can cook at the same rate He tilts his pan slightly to move some of the raw egg mixture from pooling on top to fill out the edge but his pan is a larger diameter than the size of his egg mixture so it's not gonna get that nice really nice round shape. It'll be a round shape but it just won't be kind of the perfect circle that hitting the edges would create. Again making long cuts, but this time because the other pieces were already cut it's going to create a dice on the pieces and he's tapping the shell with the knife to break the shell so that he can crack the egg. He's also gotten a bowl. Now he's making long cuts on his onion. So he's just cutting half moon shapes down the onion from end to end. He's gotten a spoon and he's using it to whisk his egg mixture. It's a great way to incorporate the egg yolk and white with each other, get the salt evenly distributed in the mixture, and get the onion and pepper to also evenly distribute in the mixture. He's lit his stove. and now he's using the spatula to scrape more of that uncooked egg mixture from the top where it's pulled into areas that may allow it to cook more quickly. He looks to have a nonstick skillet between 10 and 12 inches in diameter. and he's cut the stem end off of his chili pepper as well. Then he put those in the discard pile. He's cut the other end off, maybe the root end. and then continues to press on it. He's spooning some salt into his bowl with the cut vegetables. and he's gotten his small utility kitchen knife. And then he's turned them 45 degrees. And he's... He's moving very quickly in a vigorous circular motion. That's the best technique to do this. And he has a small green chili pepper he's removing from the refrigerator. And now he's using the same technique to add the green chili pepper. And now his omelette is finished, he's moving it to a plate. It is folded, so that's not necessarily how a masala omelette would be presented. And he has a wooden spatula. He's drizzling oil in his pan?", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

But just, you know, for better ball control, support so you don't turn it over so that you can complete this motion by moving the ball from the floor up to your shot, you need two hands. But great footwork that helps, great lifting of that right knee as you lift it up for the shot. Again, great push off of the left foot, raising of the right knee, arm bars there to act as a protective piece, if you will, between a defender and the ball.

Looking at the player going into his attempted jump shot on the right frame, some improvements the player can make to become more efficient on his attempt is by starting out using the proper footwork, stepping with his left foot first, and having his right foot come down second, going into his release, or the player can jump on two feet at the same time, allowing himself to be more on balance going into his release. Looking at the player going into his shooting pocket on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player does a good job of getting his ball placement position above his shoulder to allow the ball to create a higher arc on its release.

Some improvement the player can make is to keep his follow-through extended above his shoulder after his release, allowing his jump to take him straight up and down, allowing him more balance, and providing more arc for the ball to get above the rim, developing, again, the proper angle and knees of dropping inside the rim.

Looking at the player going into his mid-range attempted jump shot on the right frame, we can notice that a slight improvement the player can make to become more efficient. His attempt is to have his body placement position lower in an athletic stance, allowing the player to become quicker going into his release, more unbalanced. And more powerful going into his jump, allowing the ball to gain the proper rotation, arc, and accuracy it needs to have the opportunity of getting above the rim. Looking at the player going into his attempted jump shot on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player does well at incorporating some footwork into his attempt by stepping initially with his right foot first and having his left foot come down. Going into his release, this allows the player to become more aligned towards the rim, creating a much easier attempt. Looking at the result of the attempted jump shot from the offensive player, we can notice that the ball does hit the back of the rim, but was in the correct alignment it needed.

However, some improvement to help the player is having his shoulders squared more towards the back of the rim on the release, allowing a better angle for the ball to travel directly towards our target area, helping it drop softly in the rim.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I would encourage the dancer to immediately start more grounded, so plie their knees, or bend their knees and send those hips back so they're working from a grounded motion. Here I would encourage the dancer to have more strength and power through the arms and more follow through from the shoulder all the way to the tips of the fingers. I would encourage the dancer to have more attack in these steps and really be on top of the music. So having more attack means not only being physically present in the body, but also moving a half a second quicker so they're right on top of the rhythm.

As we can see there's a hole entry on the hold where the climber should be able to slide at least one or two fingers into the hold and in order to sustain that hold the climber has to bring his left hand to cross over the right hand grip. Here the climber manages to move his right foot to a higher stance. This will help the climber to squat down, bringing his center of gravity low, so when the climber is ready to pull himself in from the grips, the climber can then push forcefully on the feet. And that way the climber will be able to distribute his weight evenly at the stance when freeing up the hand for the next hold. As the climber was able to transfer the weight for the hand placement being on the big jog above We can see how the climbers feet has Come off from the wall This motion of the feet swinging out completely This is called cutting feet and now the climber needs to apply extra pressure on the grips So he doesn't completely peel off the wall Now the climber when he swings back to the wall, he will have to engage the core This so that the climbers able to bring the feet back into place on the wall and stop himself Himself from swinging and also as he is swinging back. He can visualize where the next foot placement will be to make him Ready to be placed for the next move Well, the climber is in this position where he sends his right foot over to join the same area where his left foot was placed. This is called matching. And in order to do this, the climber needs to make a careful stance, does not compromise from bringing himself completely out of the wall since his most reliable grip is the right hand. In the other hand, being a monohulled, the climber needs to constantly be pulling on the hold, but in this instance, he's transferring the weight to be down at the feet and at the hand to release some of the pressure in that monohulled as it can be very strenuous on the arm. It's important that when the climber is going up for the reach that he engages on a forceful pull up. The pull up being on the left hand. Once he has reached the closeness on that pull up, he needs to sustain this pull and this is called a lock off. Also another way where the climber got to pull was on the heel hook. The climber had to engage the heel to be pulled towards him and once the climber had pulled it enough where he was able to then shift his weight over to the right side to then stand up on the heel hook. Once gaining height to make the reach. To sustain this move of both the heel hook and the grip, the climber had sent the left leg extended. This is called flagging. The climber has tapped the foot, the toe against the wall so that he's able to sustain this position while engaging on the reach. The climber must continue to engage the grips. As we can see, he's maintaining a pull-up position to create pressure and release pressure down at the foot switch. The climber is unnecessary that he glances down to make sure that he makes the accurate placement during the foot switch. In this case, the climber needs to bring the right foot into placement where the left foot is. This, he will need to continually apply pressure on the hold before releasing the left foot out of place. Here the climber has started because the climber is no longer touching the mat. As we can see the climber is creating a pulling motion and applying friction onto the hands placed in the hold. This one being a flat edge the climber must keep the elbows pointing down in order to apply friction and bringing himself in to keep his center of gravity distributed at the feet placed on the wall. The left foot is placed on the hold and the right leg is extended where the foot is pressed against the wall. This position is so that the climber can engage into a pull-up motion sending the left grip out to the next hold, left hand out to the next hold. The climber will have to gain direction by pressing down on the right foot that's against the wall in order to go out on the direction that the climber needs to do and needs to shift the weight over to the highest foot to maintain the position. As the climber is making the reach, we can see how the right leg has gone out into a flag. And the climber is forcing the toe to tap against the wall to force the climber to keep his hips engaged to be close to the wall when performing the move up to the next hold. As we can see the climber is glancing over at the feet. It's important the climber knows how to release the heel hook as it can be tricky because the heel hooks usually apply a lot of force. So the climber must bring his left foot on top of the hold to create pressure to transfer the weight over to the left foot. That way the climber can, in control, release the heel hook from its place. As the climber released the right foot out of the foot chip, the climber has brought the right foot to a higher stance. This one, placing it in a big ledge, the climber is able to send the heel into the wall. This, so that the climber is able to perform a heel hook. This type of position of foot placement will help the climber to bring the heel in a forceful push or sustaining a series of moves after the heel is being placed. Heel hooks are known to be strong because the climber will need to pull himself towards the hold in order to keep engaged. And also later on, he could rotate the foot onto the hold in order to create a stance from it. The climber here is going on a swing back again. This is because the climber lacked from applying sufficient pressure onto the right toe which was the one that was placed on the wall before he went back again on a ride. This can tire the arms since they are continuing to be engaged. Once the climber had switched his feet, he presses quickly on that left foot to then disengage the mono hold for the climber to make the reach up to the next hold. As we can see the hold that he just went for, this is a jug. However, the jug is placed sideways. So the climber must have a side pull when making the placement. But the climber brings the hand placement all the way at the top. So the climber is slightly not applying a full layback when having to sustain the hold and sends the elbow to be pointing outwards to create pressure while wrapping the hand behind the hold. As we can see, in order for the climber to make that reach, and he made that foot swap down below, he had sent the right leg to be extended, this one to act as a flag, which will help the climber to keep balance when sending the reach on the opposite direct with the opposite limb. The leg being extended on a flag also helps the climber to apply mostly pressure, shifting the weight over to the foot that is being in place. As the climber sustained himself from peeling off the wall, he had engaged on a forceful pull into the wall. This engaged mostly at his upper body and pressing down on the right foot. Now the climber is not looking at the feet down below supposedly because the right foot is placed on a bigger hold and not in a foot chip. The climber then brings their left foot into place and is matching the same hold that the right foot is matching. So this one he's creating a foot switch which he needs to keep a tight grip onto the holds above in order to release some of the pressure while the climber makes the switch of the feet down below. As the climber was forcing the pull in, the climber was able to bring his hips close to the wall. However, his right arm, being a wide pull up, wasn't able to pull any more forcefully. And the right arm has given out before the climber was able to make any placement of the grip onto the edge. The climber after making a few adjustments at the matching grip, he has glanced over at the feet and it's important that again he keeps the grip tight as he will need to release some pressure down at the feet but still continue to have pressure at the feet while making the foot swap. He brings the left toe to come on top of the right foot. The moment that the right foot will leave the place and the climber will be able to immediately place the toe above the foot chip. Due to the mono placing the hand as an underhand cling, the climber is able to pull a distance at the hold and this one by creating a forceful press of the elbow towards the ribs and forcing the pull away from the wall. Now as the climber will bring him closer to the wall when making the reach, the stance was important for the climber to make the reach. As we can see, the left foot was placed the lowest compared to the right foot. This one because the climber continues to step up on the right foot once reaching the height up for the grip. In this case, what helped the climber to continue to have direction out slightly to the right when at the reach was due to the left foot pushing against the foothold which sends him over and the stance to go up in the direction of reach. It seems as the climber when making the reach to the edge, the left hand has tapped too hard above the hold. This compromising the climber from applying the right pressure as the fingers right now were pushed away due to the bounce off the wall and at this time the climber's grip is slipping off from the hold. And the climber also had gone up for a commitment move. The reason why the climber has dropped limb due to thinking that their left hand has to stick the move. If the climber was going to do this, maybe he needs to make a forceful pull in but at the same time be more thoughtful when making the throw so he can land the grip at the fingertips at the edge instead of tapping them against the wall. Here we can see the climber bringing himself onto a pole with the palms pressing against the hold that is flat. The climber must remain to keep the elbows underneath the hold to sustain the grip. As the climber will need to now shift the hips pressure. Once the climber was able to secure the monohold, making the forceful pull and a pull in position, the climber then sends the left foot into a placement, being the toe against the hold. Now the climber is glancing over for the next move. Potentially, this one, the climber will need to think about gaining height to make the reach up to the next hold. In this case the climber has chosen to place the strongest finger being the middle finger into the hold This is a small pocket. So it only allows one finger to Be into the pocket. This is called a mono hold so in order for the climber to sustain the grip, he must close the grip and Pull the hand away from the wall in order to create force at the grip The climber again glances at the feet while hanging on to the hold above. The hold above right now is forcing the climber to take a slight lean to the left side. So the climber needs to be careful when making the foot switch as he's bringing the left foot to be replaced where the right foot is. As the climber glances over, he sends the right hand to come into a match where the left hand is positioned. While being on the jog, this is called matching. And before bringing his right hand over to a match, he has extended the left leg to have the toe pressed against the wall. This will help the climber to keep balance and sustain pressure on transferring the weight over to the foot being in place, the right foot. As we can see, the climber is able to sustain the grip and able to rest in this position as he is relaxing his shoulders and the arms are extended. This is a good moment for the climber to glance over for what the next move is and get himself into position. Since the climber needed to apply a committed dynamic move up to the reach, we can see how the climber was able to wrap the hand around the hold, this one being a jug. So the climber is able to pinch the hold from underneath and create pressure by not only pulling away on the hold but also pinching the hold which secures the grip. As we can see the climber was able to make it and extends the arm mostly forcefully because his left foot has come out of place and he's trying to pull himself in to avoid the body completely swinging out. At the same time his right foot is being engaged, being pressed down so that the climber is able to sustain the grip and the move. Here we can see the climber being crunched up once making the left hand placement on the jug. The jug, because the climber has a positive grip, meaning that there is a lip and the climber is able to wrap the hand to place the fingers inside the hold, this will allow the climber to then later on pull away from the hold in order to sustain the grip. It's important that the climber still remain on the pressure of the left foot placement as the climber is very close to the ground and letting the foot slip could end the climb. So the climber right now is making a pull in position and keeping the left foot placed, applying pressure by pushing down on the toe. The climber was able to bring his right foot into placement and pressing down so that the climber is able to transfer the weight to the foot placement. This is important because the climber will need to continue to keep his center of gravity close to the wall. He quickly has sent the right hand up to match the right foot. Here the climber is starting at a sit-down start, meaning that the climber will have to place the weight onto the hands and feet that are placed on the wall. Since the climber is starting with no weight at the limbs being positioned onto the wall, the climber, once he raises the hips, he will have to distribute the weight onto the grips and foot placements. So sit-down starts are known to be difficult as they will add a grade to the climb.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

They should try to have their thumb be more consistent when they're playing. The clarity in the notes are lost towards the end of this section. The guitarist should just practice very slowly. To be the most ergonomically efficient, it would be good for the guitarist to have both of their feet flat on the floor instead of having their foot on their side. The guitarists could experiment with the thumb being more aligned with their hand, perhaps more along their first and second finger. They play a bunch of chords in succession. Their right hand is very efficient. Sometimes they're using very minimal movement. Sometimes they just maximize a little bit more and they can get a little bit more of a healthy, strong amount of the string. This section is also not very clear. It would be good for them to coordinate with their right hand a little bit better, making sure that each note is being strummed. When placing the higher finger, the guitarist can be even more efficient by putting the lower finger also down. And while going up, the thumb is now behind the neck. If this section that the guitarist is playing isn't coming across very clearly, I'd recommend for them to practice very slowly and make sure that they're playing each note evenly with the right hand. Their right hand is also very efficient, they're keeping their hand very close to the strings. The guitarist's left hand is very efficient as they're playing.

Instead, her feet should be parallel and they should both be facing aligned with the rest of her legs. So continue, the dancer is traveling around a wall vertically using the whole floor. However, she should make sure that she is dancing on her toes with her heels lifted off the ground so that she is lighter on her feet. The dancer does a good job of bending backwards here well, with lots of flexibility. Her eyes are looking at the ceiling, the top of her head is pointing straight to the left side of the room, which is really great. It might be hard for her to balance because her partner continues to move and walk to his left while she's in this position. However, her positioning here is good. The dancer does a really good job here of extending her leg completely in a straight line. The dancer is looking downward here at her feet, and instead she should be making eye contact with her partner. Nancy did a good job of traveling far in these opening steps using a lot of the floor at her disposal. The dancers look as if she's tripping here. The two dancers are colliding feet. The dancer in the black's right foot, the dancer in the pink's right foot as well are colliding here, so they need to be better coordinated with each other. The dancers are too close here.

Taking his time and you know not trying to do the same thing over and over again without much change definitely hindered his performance but he definitely had a really nice energy and used the space really well with spinning and changing directions. And so here he's doing a kick and then he's actually working on his balance a bit because he right now he's kicking his right foot out and this foot does not hit the floor until he switches feet. So a really nice way of holding his balance but again if it was on the music with the right timing it would have been even better. So I'm not sure if he's mimicking dancing with a partner, but if he is, again, making sure as the leader of a partnering dance, he wants to make sure he's on the beat of the music and not really fumbling over his steps because it's just not as clear as it would be if he just did the simple rock step, triple step. He's starting to add in more steps that aren't necessary. So here's one moment where his level actually changed a little bit. He's a little hunched over. His knees are bent more and he does a clap. And I think that's something that actually could have been continued, something repeated just to kind of give a little different feeling instead of the same rock step. Triple step. So really nice here, but I wish it could have kept going. So for a while he's doing the same rock step triple step and then taking kind of a pivot to turn around when he comes up in this direction and then he goes back around here and does the rock step triple step. I think again the music is really throwing it off a little bit because he's not on the music and then his feet kind of start to shuffle and not really make as much sense as it did before. So just kind of clearing up those steps not adding any extra steps but just doing enough steps to fill the counts would definitely help this part a lot. So the dancer starts just doing a little twist as you see his feet are first the toes are facing his right and then they twist and face the left. It's a nice twist because he's still keeping the upper body almost straight to the front so that way the full body is twisting around. So a nice way to just get started in the music with this style of dance. So here he jumps out after the kicks and I think this could have been a really nice transition into the next movement if you would have held this a little longer and then got back on the right rhythm of the music because even the sound of the song gave a good reason for him to jump out and just kind of freeze. So he could have held that for a little bit longer and just froze his body a little bit and maybe just moved his upper body for a change without moving his lower body and I think it would have flowed and transitioned better to the next steps. So here he's doing just some step kicks and kicking out to the front and then he did a little ball change back behind him. This could be nice again if it was right on the music and on the correct timing and especially because the song changed a little bit you start to hear the soloist singing and I think also his arms could have done something a little different maybe pushing them up or just out to the side but less like in the L shape by his his waist. So just doing something a little different with the arms since now this is a different kick step that he's doing. And so here he's doing a series of cross, stepping back, cross step, triple step, a rock step, triple step, and he's doing it facing both directions. So facing this way and then coming back around facing this way. He does get right in the beginning but then he gets off the music because he's doing cross step, triple step, triple step, and it's not quite staying on the rhythm of the music. So he either needs to cut out the second triple step or make sure he moves a little faster to be on the right beat of the music.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

As you can see here at the shot right here in this frame all you can see is his hand is because he extended his arm, his right arm, so far away from his body that is out of the frame and out of the view of the camera you can't even see his arm. So that's how wide that he's extended his right arm. By doing so it really keeps the ball away from the defense and it's really difficult and for the most part really impossible for a defender to actually get to that ball because it's so far away from his frame. The player did a really good job of doing a wide high hook here and the placement of the shot was perfect. He hit the top corner of the backboard and went in. This is a textbook way to execute this drill. After making the layup and catching the ball out of the net, he grabs the ball again. He does a good job of catching the ball cleanly. That's a really important detail with this micing drill, is that you don't want the ball to hit the ground. Like every layup, you want to catch it out of the net and continue it from side to side to make it nice and fluid. On this attempt here, as you see, he catches it out of the net. He steps with his left foot first, which is going to get him over to the right side of the basket when he swings this right foot around and place it here. That'll get him over the right side of the basket. And then he can get, now he's put himself in the proper position for the right-hand layup. Okay, the player shows really good technique and fundamentals with this right hand layup. As you can see, the ball is nice and high in his right hand. And he also has his left hand here to protect the ball just in case anybody tries to come in and block the shot. Like if a defender is on this side and they try to attack him this way and try to block the shot, he's using that left hand to keep the defense away. So it gives him just the time he needs to release the shot. A shooter does a great job on this left-hand layup by placing the ball and hitting the top corner of the box. If we get into our layups and if we're able to hit that spot on the top corner of the box or that layup, it's going to go in almost every single time. After a player makes the layup, he catches the ball out of the net and then does steps with his right foot first to make sure that he gets to the left side of the basket, and then he's going to swing this left foot over around here to square himself up to the basket.

So that's why she's whisking it, or beating the egg with the spoon as rapidly as she's doing it, because she wants to incorporate all those flavors. And the onion also. Need to be careful with that sharp utility knife. She's got to tuck her fingers more so she doesn't miss the chance of cutting the tips of her fingers. She's having a little difficulty adjusting our fire. So I'm glad she was able to move it to the next eye over to continue the cooking process. She's throwing more oil in the pot to prevent it from sticking. That's why I was stating earlier, she could have put that oil in there earlier. It's really sticking because the oil ain't really up to temp. The pot is hot, but it's not properly lubricated because she didn't move the pot in a circular motion, making sure the oil covers the bottom of the pan. That's why she has to add more oil now. She should be moving the pot in a circular motion instead of spreading the egg out with the spoon. If she moves the pot in a circular motion, the uncooked part of the egg will expand to the bottom of the pan, which will create a stronger base. See all this space she has back here? She would just move that pot in a circular motion. She could fill that void, fill that space up, and that would create a stronger base for her.

Holds, extends that arm out there, flex that wrist till it hits rim. Nice job there. And then he takes a dribble, and that's fine if it's a free throw, but I don't think this is a free throw. And you don't have time to take this dribble. He's looking at it, so his eyes came off his target. So let's take away that dribble. Again, he catches it. Again, if this is a free throw, this is fine, but you've got to be quicker. You know, if you don't have time to pause and shoot it, or you're gonna be defended and guarded and not be able to get your shot off. As a right-hand shooter, I love to have this right foot a little bit out in front. I love his knee bends. He's starting to sit here a little bit, which is good. But see, you can barely see it here, but see how both hands are on the each side of the ball? We need this right hand to get behind the basketball. This is good here. And he's looking up, which is good. We want to keep our eye on the target. Does again a great job of that follow-through, little knee bend here, nice feet are apart. This guide hand, I would keep it up. He drops it back. Maybe just keep it up here in front of you a little bit. Here's the shot. Again, see very little elevation here. That guide hand is in the shot way too much. We want to get that guide hand out, but he's got the right idea with the right shooting arm. But he's basically shooting it with two hands. We want to shoot with one hand. Good extension here of the body. Just need more explosiveness, more lift. Here's the shot. In fact, this is really nice. Maybe get the elbow in a tad, but look how his fingers are nice and spread. And the guide hand comes off, but I think what it's done, it's kind of touched the ball to cause it maybe to spin out. In fact, you know, this is much better here, because I can tell the guide hand is not on the ball. I just want it to stay still. Again, I think he would get more power and explosiveness if he would utilize his legs. Here the shooter is shooting a fifteen footer. In this egocentric view you can see he's right handed and you know the guide hand, the left hand is in the shot way too much. He's kind of followed through or snaps the wrist of both hands. You know ideally you want to shoot with one hand which I think he's right handed so let's use that hand let's get the guide hand out of the shot and the palm of that guide hand should just be kind of facing inward just really soft not really doing anything and also on his shot he's really not getting off the ground he's not really utilizing his lower body if you will to get the shot up. So we'd love to see more lift, elevation, use of the legs here and let's get that guide hand out of the shot. The shooting arm looks pretty good my suggestion is maybe bring that right elbow in a little bit. Again, this is the release. He's got pretty good arc on the ball here. This is really nice. Good follow-through. But look at our guide hand. So important. This arm, it just wants to help guide it up there. It really does nothing beyond that. Again, let's explode. Let's lift. He does a good job of extending his hips here. Here's the shot. Again, too much of the non-shooting hand in the basketball. I mean, I can tell he's right-handed. We got to get this non-shooting hand out of the shot. Let's move the right elbow in under the ball. Good extension here of the hips. Again, we need more lift and elevation. Again, he's waiting on this pass. Ideally, for my expert opinion, let's drop our hips, bend our knees, let's get our feet moving and step in and meet this pass. Go get it. It's so that it helps you use your legs and explode up. Again, here's the hands. Again, let's backstop it with our shooting hand. Let's really bend our hips here and get low. Again, you know, I like how he's going on his toes, but I'd like to see him get up off the ground here, good extension. Let's get this shooting elbow in more in line with the basketball, but he does a good job with, you know, breaking that wrist and snapping the fingers. We need to get this guide hand in here, and it basically does nothing. Here, again, on the shot, very little elevation and lift because he's not really using his body. You can see that guide hand, how it's in the shot. And what happens with that is just it takes away the backspin that you want, the rotation you want, the spin you want as the ball makes its way to the basket. He does break the wrist of his right shooting hand, which is what you want to see, but let's get that shooting elbow in under the basketball. Again, here comes the pass. Ideally in this particular drill, I'd love to see him maybe step and meet this pass. Maybe step with his left foot, follow by the right and catch and shoot. Here he's just waiting on the pass and the reason you want to meet this pass is two-folded. One, you want to meet your pass so a defender doesn't step in and steal it. And then secondly, it helps you utilize your lower body and the legs to help or what give you power to get the ball to the basket. And then this is a really good look. He is doing a good job here. You can see he's reaching out for the basketball. I'd love to see him move his whole body, but he does have his arms out which is really good. He's a right-hand shooter. See how both his hands are kind of the same? You want to bring this right hand and backstop that pass. So that's kind of how you want to shoot it. And then use this hand here, the left hand, the non-shooting hand, to help guide that ball into the backstop. So that's kind of how you, you know, I would love to see that the hands, maybe this hand especially, moved around here just a little bit.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So now she's kind of sitting down on it. So now that she's in this position, she can kind of think about stepping up and driving up instead of just pulling her way up. So when she's making this move, she does a good job. One is staying opposite pose, so she's holding off her right hand, toying with her left, but instead of just pulling in or standing up with this left leg, she also utilizes this right foot, smearing into the wall to kind of start the motion and drive her up the wall, so that way she can push her weight to the left, over that left foot, and then stand up with the left while she pulls with the right and kind of twists into the wall. So all this kind of coordinated effort together is what kind of gives her the range and the height and the stability to hit this high hold. It's a good job. You know, she's right hand, right foot, so she does a little foot swap. So she can stick her right foot out and flag and stay opposite pose, right hand, left foot. Then she kind of sits this high foot and so it's kind of important to see the starting position so as she moves up on it she's gonna take this right knee and eventually kind of shift it all the way over on top so that way she can toe straight down through this hold and take full advantage of the position and kind of set her weight on top of that hold.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So trying to judge this as a whole piece just was not very simple. So they definitely have to think about the leader and follower movements and then also being clear in their steps so they're in sync a bit more. I think here they could have let go hands because I think it's kind of restricting them from this improv moment of being a little more fluid and free. Definitely let go hands at this point would help a lot. So here I feel like their movements are really just heavy. I don't know if it's just the choreography or what but they definitely need to be lighter on their feet and he can I think just lead a little bit better because they're just still not quite in sync with what they're doing. I think he was trying to add more power and energy at this moment of swinging her out, and she wasn't really allowing him to do that. So that kind of stopped the energy and the flow of movement. So definitely as a leader and a partner, you want to have this level of trust, because that is the only way your movements are going to come together as in sync and flow a lot better for the steps. That was a nice swing out as she twisted forward. He twirled her around and brought her back to this side. But that was a nice transition swing out to coming together. So the beginning starts, I'm not quite sure what step they're doing. It looks like they're trying to do a rock step triple step but it's a bit unclear so definitely want to clarify the very beginning of the steps. So here again they're doing very different steps so it's not really aligning. She either she's not following him or he's not doing the steps correctly so when he steps back she should be almost identical to what he's doing unless he's swinging her around which he's not doing at this time. So definitely need to work on being a bit more in sync so that way the steps make more sense. I also think their hands held here, there just seems to be a lack of intensity in their holding. So definitely want to make sure that he has a good grip on her so that way she feels more trusting of him and then their movements will then be a bit more in sync. So that was a good transition into the turn and then swinging her out. It was pretty fluid in their movement.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It was a really great show of his skills as a pianist and really well done. His posture was good, his hand position, his technique was good. He had good time. His rhythm was really well done throughout. So again, there we have that glissando. We want to make sure we turn our hand over and it will give us a much more even glissando down the keyboard. All right, so kind of I think it would be helpful to pull out the music that he has learned, and he may have learned it by ear, but kind of pulling that out, at least the chord structure, and making sure that those are all right in there so that we don't hear that dissonance within the piece that he's playing. All right, and that low note is kind of popping out there and so we want to be really gentle and careful So that we can so the melody is always kind of floating over the top All right, so through this section we have really flat long stretch out fingers And so it just I mean and with cords, I mean sometimes we do have to kind of stretch But we want to feel that curve to those fingers because it allows us our fingers to Have to be all the same length when touching the keys where when we extend them it it it's like Kind of like knife-handy it and so you're doing more of the work from your wrist instead of the wrist from your from the The work from your fingers which gives you more control and dexterity yeah through this whole section here so it is a little crazy and so we want to really solidify and make sure we have correct pitches. Alright, so right here our rhythm is a little irregular again working on Slowing this down is not actually going to help it because sometimes finding that groove you have to really find it at a certain tempo but Maybe working hands independently would be helpful All right, so throughout this section his tempo is good. His rhythm is good. He's not hesitating there um But it gets a little mechanical just the overall sound and phrasing it gets a little mechanical And so I that is kind of attributed to those long straight fingers And so I would just you know Work on releasing the tension from his shoulders and then you know, let that kind of flow out through his fingers That is a lot of just kind of gooping up the piano, and so we want to be really careful that we're not just faking it. That we are playing what is intended by the composer there. Alright, I really like the drive of this, you know it it flows a little bit better and so just it being that more delicate and he's kind of taking the pressure off and There's not that tension kind of relaxes as we work through that softer temp or that softer dynamic So again, they're just really ensuring that we have all those clean notes. I would say we were like 90% right, but we got to have all the correct pitches. Yeah, so throughout this section the left hand is a little heavy and so I would just kind of lighten that up I wouldn't be digging in quite so hard with the left hand Because it just buries the melody and the melody is what is recognizable and so we just have those chords with the left hand and we want to really kind of leave those as a secondary item where the melody should be brought out Alright, and now we kind of have that boogie-woogie section and he's doing a nice job kind of pushing that tempo through All right, so throughout this section Hand position is actually a lot better with curved hand position curve fingers and contact with the keys and Overall, it is going very well Alright, so that was a really effective modulation as we're going into a new piece and yeah, here we go. Alright, and that was a really nice contrasting section where we're having the phrasing was really good and it's a it did slow down slightly and it got softer throughout the Dynamic was softer throughout Alright, so that passage right there as we're jumping down really recommend kind of breaking that apart and Slowing the tempo down to really line that up So that we have correct pitches because that was kind of just a clump skip down the keyboard So I kind of like this lightened up tempo here. It kind of allows us to feel more of the emotion conveyed through that piece. Great, and if you look at his hand position here, it is fantastic. So those fingers are nice and curved, and this section would be very difficult to play without that hand position curve. Nice, lovely technique. All right, he does a really nice job of transitioning from piece to piece and I find in those Transition, yeah transition chords to move into the next piece Okay, the pianist starts. This is a different style piece It's not in the classical literature. And so you can see he kind of has a unique hand position here to really so it just to get those Those rhythms and sounds that he would like to get. Oh, it's actually a little clearer over here. And so He is doing a nice job of executing that Alright, so it is memorized, but in right there we had we did have an incorrect chord And kind of looking for that resolution All right, so overall pretty solid that it was a memorized piece and so you know you can tell that there was a lot of effort put into learning that and overall really well done just kind of taking a look at some of those taking a look at the glissandos and kind of reworking that and then the middle section where there were a lot of faster notes and slowing that down reworking and making sure we have all the correct pitches. All right, and I'm really careful with those glissand, not arpeggios going up, that they're well articulated and we can hear each of those pitches. And so working those out slowly would be really helpful at this point. All right, and with that glissando we never want to pull from we do want to pull but we want to flip our hand over and use the backs of our fingernails and that creates a much more even glissando without the kind of click from key to key All right, and we have kind of a shift in tonality here. I am anxious to see if we are shifting the key or if we're modulating to a new piece. Alright, so throughout this boogie woogie section, it's just in a blues form and he's doing a nice job just keeping that moving forward. So, and I think his left hand is fine. His right hand is just, is really kind of slapping up and down. And so, we want to really kind of work on getting and tweaking that right hand position. All right, and then we kind of see that you know awkward hand position with the length and fingers We want to see that nice round curved hand position All right, um, although this isn't a different style his fingers are slightly extended It may be helpful to work on that rounded position we'll see how it goes Alright, throughout this section he's doing a nice job keeping that tempo steady and even and that driving pulse throughout the left hand.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This was actually her best attempt. As you can see, the placement of the ball is right here. It's outside this line. Well, we'll say it's on the line. Just slightly outside that line. It's close enough to the line where even though she's using backspin, instead of doing more backspin, because the placement is close to that line and the angle that she actually released it from is going to drop down into this basket. The angle that she used to shoot the ball and the angle from where she released it and actually hit the backboard is perfect for the use of backspin if you're not able to use sidespin because you actually need to practice it a little bit with the sidespin. If you don't know how to use the sidespin and you have the typical backspin on your release, this is really, really good. The issue that she had while she missed this shot is because, once again, she put too much power on the shot and so the ball came flying over the front of the rim. She ended up missing the shot. She had a little bit of a softer touch. The angle where this ball would have dropped right into the basket. As you can see, it's also above this top box. The higher the ball is above this box, the softer the touch is needed for it to drop into the basket here. The placement of where she hit it on the backboard was excellent. Just have to soften the touch up so the ball would drop into the basket. As we talked about previously, she stepped in with this outside foot first. And then she's going to put this left foot back down here for a two foot jump for her layup. Just coming from the direction that she came from is not the proper footwork. And is putting herself at a disadvantage to actually finish the shot. As you can see, once again, she did a two-foot reverse layup. Did a good job of placing it. The ball hit this corner of the box. Did a good job of hitting the correct spot on the backboard that we want to hit. But again, since it was too strong and she put too much force on it, as you can see, the ball ended up coming off strong from this backboard here and coming up and over and coming up over the front of the rim, resulting in the missed shot. So it was very important that we not also hit the correct spot off the backboard for our reverse layups, but we also have the proper amount of touch so that it doesn't come off too strong and we missed the shot entirely. Okay, so you can see on this shot here, she's actually hitting. So we have this box right here, the outside box. We have that line of the box right there. As you can see, the ball is on the outside of this box. But the shot that she uses, she doesn't put any side spin so the ball isn't rotating this way. Let me see if I make this a little bit clearer. So basically the ball isn't rotating at this angle. Like if we have a side spin, it will rotate that way. The way she's shooting, the ball is rotating this way. So since we have that spin on the ball, and she hit it here, the ball is coming straight back to us this way. Where the ball hits here, the ball pops back out this way. If she put spin on the ball, it would spin into the basket on the release. Now in order, if we're going to shoot the ball where there's no spin, the angle that she's at, we will have to hit somewhere in this area where the ball will hit the back board here and then hit the back board in this area and then drop right back into the basket. And also too, we need a little bit of touch, a softer touch on the shot because she's putting so much power into the shot. The ball is coming here and coming off the backboard really, really hard and over the rim to the point where even if she was to hit the correct spot with no rotation somewhere in this area, the ball, she still would not make the shot because she's throwing the ball too hard off of the backboard. So she would need a little softer touch off the backboard and hitting the correct area since she didn't put any side spin on the ball. It's more of the traditional front spin, excuse me, the traditional back spin on the ball. You see on this shot the ball, she put the back spin on the shot. She put the back spin on the ball when she shot the ball and the ball hit here on the backboard which is outside this line of the box on the backboard. So anytime the ball hits the outside that line on the backboard of the box, it have to, that ball must have this side spin in order for it to hit here and it can spin and the trajectory of the ball will go in towards the basket. But since she has that back spin and the ball is spinning in this direction, the ball is going to hit the backboard here and this come right back. So for this one I had to go a few frames past where I wanted to just because the player's hand was in the way and you couldn't see clearly. But on this one, that placement, she actually hit the ball here off the backboard, which is below this line or on this line. Even if it's on that line, that's not enough. We need it to be above this line at the bare minimum. Bare minimum, no matter what level that you're on, whether you're playing a really low level or at a higher level. At a lower level against less athletic people, we can get away with hitting the ball and get on our layups and hit it on this line because we're not worried about someone coming in and blocking our shot. But if somebody is really, really athletic and we have to get the ball up high over their hand, we want to try to hit it up higher on the top of the box. But even still, anything on this line or below that line is going to be really difficult and really lessen the chances of us getting the ball into the basket just because the angle will not work. Also, as she put so much force and power into this shot, the ball is going to come off long and over the rim and missing the rim completely. Since she didn't put any side spin on the ball, the placement where she hit it, if we had the ball rotating with side spin, and the ball is rotating this way, the ball is spinning that way, the ball will hit the backboard and spin in into the basket. But since she has the spin with the backspin and the ball is actually spinning this way, since the ball is spinning that way, once the ball hits the backboard, the ball is going to come back at that angle following the trajectory of the backspin. So, that's why with this shot right here, it hit the backboard and she put so much power on it that it just came back this way from where she originally shot the ball. on this shot right here. Again, she hit the ball outside of that line on the square of the backboard. Since the ball is on the outside of that line, we will need side spin in order for it to come off. But since she didn't put any side spin on this shot with the ball hitting that spot on the backboard, it's not going to spin into the basket the way we want it to. It's just going to come back out short of the rim. Also, she put too much power into this shot. So if she was to make this placement instead of the ball hitting here, if she shot it and the ball hit the backboard in this area, it would drop in. But since it was too much power, no matter if she hits the correct spot or not, this ball is going to come off over the front rim because she's put way too much force and too much power into the actual shot. So she would need a softer touch for the ball to hit off this backboard and go nice and easy into the basket. Unfortunately, this player didn't take any dribbles while she was doing the demonstration, so every repetition was a travel. Because she didn't take any dribbles, but it would assume that she took a dribble. And she finished with, she's going for a two foot reverse layup, every shot layup reverse layup she did on this one on the right side of the basket was off two feet. So that was the premise that she was purposely attempting to do a two foot reverse layup. This right here, you can see this part was really good as far as stepping with the inside foot. She steps with that left foot, and then she's going to take this right foot here, and she will place it down over in this area here to square herself up to the basket for the shot. Like her footwork to end the shot was decent. On this layup, she switches up her footwork and she steps with her outside foot first, this one being her right foot, and then she's going to bring this left foot on her second step and then jump off two feet for the layup. Now for a beginner, like as you can tell, like watching, like just watching this clip, you can see that she is relatively new to the game. So like this footwork here is good, useful for a situation where you get an offensive rebound or a pass and you're directly underneath the basket and you have to do a hard power dribble and you will step with your outside foot first and then bring your left foot first to get from underneath the basket and get yourself into an area where you can make the shot. So if she was starting directly underneath the basket and she did this footwork, that would be the correct footwork. But coming off the dribble from the opposite side of the floor for this reverse layup, that would be incorrect footwork in this situation. So it is really, really important that you also have the proper footwork and with the moves that you do in order to give yourself the best chance to actually make the shot. As you see, on this one, she did a good job of getting further over to the right side of the basket, giving her a better angle. As you can see from here, she has a straight angle because she got further over to where she can hit it right off the ball, can go right off the top corner of the box, and go straight in. So, for this one, even though she didn't put any side spin on it, it was more of the traditional back spin for the layup. The angle she got to, the placement on the floor that she got to, is a perfect spot for this layup. But unfortunately, she even did a good job of hitting it in the correct spot, the top corner of this box. As you can see, she hit the top corner of this box. So, whether you put a little bit of side spin or the traditional back spin on it, it's going to go, because of the angle where she released it from, at this angle here, you see where the ball is coming from? The angle went right there. It's going to bounce back in and go into the basket. That's what would happen if she put the correct amount of touch. I had a softer touch. And since she put too much force into it, so even though she had the right angle, the ball went over the rim and out over the front of the rim. And she ended up missing the shot because she put too much power into the shot. So even though the placement of the layup and the ball off the backboard was correct, the fact that she put too much force into the shot itself led for the ball to come off long and too strong over the front of the rim. As you can see here, she has herself two of two feet. The body is both feet square to the basket. This is a, it's a good job of being square to the basket on the layup. However, she's running into difficulty because she's too far underneath the basket. As you can tell from this view here, like she's more so in this area. If she was to jump off one foot, she can jump from where she is right now, currently, and her momentum will guide her over more to here, jumping off one foot, which will give her a better angle to put spin off the ball and the air off the backboard this way. And she would have, but since she went off of two feet, she would need to get over more, more or so in this area, as far as, so she'd have a better angle to shoot it up off the backboard. Or, she would have to do a better job of extending this ball out in her right hand more and putting spin because the positioning that she's in right now, she's too far underneath the basket. So the position that she's in right now, instead of shooting it off the backboard, off the side here, her best opportunity to make this shot would be over the front of the rim here, whether it be straight in or high up over the rim and then off the backboard here and then back in.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This is a hold that the climber can also extend the arms to take a rest if he needs to as well. This is a known to be a beginner hold so the climber can make the move if he wants to whenever he feels prepared to do so. Here we can see how the climber brought the left foot to place the toe above the undercling hold. The climber must continue to pull the hold with his hand that's being in that placement as the climber is matching the hold and he will press down on the toe to sustain the move. In this instance the climber then will have to reposition his foot that's down below to a better stance and order for the climber to release the left hand from the hold. Here the climber failed to sustain the holds above. As we can see on the left frame, the holds are held correctly, meaning that one in the left side is a pinch and the right hand is placed above and the climber is creating pressure to create friction at the hold from above by closing the grip tight and leaning underneath the hold. However, the climber standing up on his left foot the moment that he lost position of the right foot, this automatically will bring the climber into a barn door, swinging out left and there was nothing that could stop him on that swing, not even the pull that was on the pinch. In this case, it would be ideal if the climber had swapped his feet so that the right foot was positioned instead and the left leg has gone out onto a flag. This to keep balance as well as the climber controlling to stop the swing with the left foot being in place. Here we can see how the climber made the reach up to the next hold. Being a block and the climber needs to keep an open grip and sustain pressure by creating friction at the fingertips, closing the grip and as well as maintaining himself to be underneath the hold. When going for this he made a dynamic move and failed to make a right foot placement at first then fully relying on the left foot. As he brought his center of gravity out to the left side to remain underneath the purple hold, the climber at this time has lost pressure down at the left foot which at this moment he is being brought down due to his center of gravity laying down below and the left hand soon to potentially come out of the grip due to the force of the climbers and gravity. As we can see the climber is making some hand gestures. This is to help the climber visualize the climb before getting onto the wall, as he will need to make sense of the sequence on how to move when going up the route. As the climber made the move out left, being a pinch hold, the climber had pressed the right toe against the wall with the leg being extended. This helps the climber to keep his hips square and also stay in place while still forcing to sustain the weight over the left foot that's being in place. As the climber released the right foot, we can see how the foot is not placed in any holes and he said he's using it to maintain balance as he won't need to force his center of gravity weight over to the highest foot, being the one that is placed on the wall. And quickly have moved the left hand to come and join up at the match where the right hand placement is. Here we can see the climber starting to place his hands in two separate holes. This is a two hand hold start. The top hold the climber will need to place the hand above and create pressure by leaning on the hold and with the left hand being placed underneath. This is called an undercling. So the climber is holding the hold from underneath by placing the palm and sliding the fingers behind it. To sustain the hold the climber must pull it towards him. This will create a sense of compression in order to sustain the move. At the same time the climber must bring the feet off the ground to start the climb, which he has already placed his right foot on a place and once the other foot comes off then the climber will be able to make the next move.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Again, especially if they're dancing with a person, they would want to be engaging with that person and not so much jumping all around the floor because they're engaging with another individual. The recommendation would be for the person dancing just to be more aware that even when there's not somebody there that with this style of dance that there is a partner, that there's somebody else in the space.

The dancer is not moving in rhythm or in time with the music. She is moving too slowly to keep up with the movement, or her movement is too slow to keep up with the music. She needs to be crossing her feet behind herself faster. Also, the dancer can add in some arm choreography to improve this movement. She could move her arms up and bent, bend her elbows and move her arms up, flexing her wrists in front of her every time she brings her foot forward. Or that's just one option, but it would be nice if she added in some type of arm movement here, not just a pedestrian habitual of her arm swinging by accident. When the dancer is rocking back and forth and she's stationary in place and not moving her legs She can rock her hips further horizontally Right and left or lean more so front and back in these directions before she starts doing those Horizontal movements that come following so she should have a greater range of motion when she's in these stationary positions The dancer is not snapping her fingers consistently on rhythm. She should be snapping her fingers every count or every other count or every third count. But either way, whatever patterning she wants to do, it should be very clear when she's snapping her fingers and it should be consistent. The dancer has to be careful that her heel of her foot makes Definitely makes contact with the floor each time she does this scuff or this heel strike of the floor forward It's not clear for a heel is always Hitting against the floor should be able to make an audible noise in which we hear it Her footwork is not articulate enough. So it's not very clear that it is striking The dancer has begun to swing her left arm outward away from her body. This is just a pedestrian-like movement. It's habitual that she's doing that should not be part of the dance. So she really has to make sure that she has control of her arms. She loses control of her arm there. Again, her arms and her hands are swinging out and in, away and towards her body. She really needs to gain control of her arms so that they are moving as she chooses, not just accidentally or as a result of momentum. Before the dancer crosses her left leg over here, she should be kicking it completely in front of herself, kicking her foot forward, then crossing it, and then opening her feet. But instead, she's just running horizontally in this direction. It's not really clear her footwork here. She has to articulate a kick first in front of her before she crosses her feet. The dancer is solely moving with her legs. She's only using her lower body. And even though this is a footwork step and primarily focused in the feet, her upper body still should be engaged and moving. Right now she's very stiff and it's just only moving her lower portion of her body.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Solid transition from the right hand to the left hand, starting this new melody up in the higher section. The ostinato arpeggiation that's happening in the bass hand stayed very steady, but adapted to allow melodic phrasing in the right hand. Really nice control over the tempo and letting the previous section be a relaxing point before coming into this more grandiose section here. The timing between the two hands is impeccable. Playing from the right to the left hand in unison is very clean. However, you can see that the finger movements are very precise and efficient. Not sure why the thumb is so far away from the keys at this point. Really excellent crossover with the first finger over to this key over the thumb here. Reach between the thumb and the pinky finger here looks really good. You can see fingers that are at the ready are curved and waiting. You can see that these are just on standby. Musician has good understanding of chordal structure and how to voice them appropriately in the hands. You can really clearly hear bassline, harmony, and melody on top. Student seems to have some pretty strong pinky tension here and you can see that there's now a lack of weight transfer from one part of the hand to the other. I would advise practicing using a little bit more weight into each of the fingers rather than individual finger pressing. I'm not sure how this section came out of the wishy-washiness of the huge arpeggiation thing that happened right before this section. I would just be aware of what kind of mood and character we're going for amid the wash and see if they can introduce this next theme and character differently. great use of texture between the two hands. Lots of notes happening in this left hand, but they're almost not hearable, which means they're bleeding each note together really smoothly in a legato fashion while there's a lot more going on in the other hand. This was a really nice transition from the into the development section here, slowed down nicely and continued in the new phrase with really nice measured tempo and relaxation in the hands and fingers. very fluid throughout. Left hand stays very loose and jumping around is very easy. Octaves here look loose as well in this hand with a nice straight wrist. Already really good seating posture, very tall torso sitting at the front of the chair and elbow position to the keyboard is really good. I accept control of tone and color throughout these sections. The nakedness of the unison bled very well into the arpeggiation moment afterward. Love the rubato taken here to slow down the end of the phrase. This musician has a great understanding of melodic structure. You can see the student is familiar with their small hands and has to adjust playing further away from the keys in order to achieve the octave between the thumb and the pinky in this section. A little muddy here, lost sense of meter. It could be more clear if this is a harder section that requires faster rhythms. Not discernible at the current play style. classic Brahms melody, solid tempo and dynamics. Really good hand position. You can see the wrists are really straight. Transfer of energy from one side of the hand to the other is good.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

It's just really a nice example of dancing through a transition step. It's very, it's interesting for the viewer to watch because it's asymmetrical but very intentional. There's energy out the fingertips. The feet are relatively simple and so we can focus on what's happening with the arms which is really nice. So here it appears she maybe forgot what she was supposed to do or is nervous about what she's about to do or something But she kind of just stops here. And so this is an example of poor transition this pausing That doesn't look intentional. Sometimes we can pause or stop or find a stillness, but this doesn't look intentional It looks like she's kind of unsure of herself Again, poor turn technique. You can see both hips are externally rotated by where the toes are facing, is how you can tell that the hips are externally rotated. So again, she's rotated over this hip to get her weight here. She's planted this foot and now she's about to bring this half of her body around the hip, which is poor turn technique. The arms are okay. I mean, it looks intentional for the most part. I wouldn't have chosen this shape for this turn or maybe at all. It looks a little weak to me, but it could have been an aesthetic choice. So it may just be that I don't find it aesthetically pleasing. Great job with this arm popping up here. She's really got it super high in the air. There's energy out the fingertips. Nice straight elbow. I love that she's on the more of the tips of her toes here. It just makes it look really nice while she's continuing the motion with her hips, shoulders, and she's brought her arm into this kind of behind her hand on hip shape, which is really, really nice. So this is a very clear moment. She hits this shape quickly enough with the timing of the music so she can hold it for the teensiest second so that it reads really well as a shape to the viewer. So another example of a dancer who thinks that turns are meant to happen around the hip joint. You can see that she's really turned out through the hip and really planted this foot and most likely going to turn the rest of her body around the hip as the pivot point and this is terrible turn technique. Good turn technique we're turning typically on the balls of the feet or one ball, one heel, something like that. She did a really good job with the arms coming down and arcing up into this shape. It looks really strong and clear and solid. This is better on this repetition. So when she came around this way the arm was very weak to her side but this time she's much stronger about it and she does this nice sort of internal rotation with the shoulder to bring it out to this position. There's energy out the fingertips, the elbow's straight, it's at shoulder height so it looks really good. Only thing I would add is looking over this shoulder would just add a little bit more emphasis to this line but she doesn't have to that would just be a little bit more icing on the cake. So here she's doing her fourth repetition of this step and unfortunately she does not fully follow through with her arms here because most likely she's thinking about the next step. Also the foot again is not coming close enough to the other one in order to make it consistent between the repetitions. So what this would have looked like if it were follow through is this would be closer to here and this elbow would be more bent and actually this would even be closer to her face with a little pulse at the end which is I really liked that little pulse at the end but she doesn't quite reach that here because she doesn't follow through. Again, quite a bit of vagueness through these arms, quite a bit of tension through the shoulders, not a lot of energy, or sorry, elbows, not a lot of energy out the fingertips. Sort of vague way that she's moving her neck here. So again, dancing through all those transitions. I really like the arm shape that she's doing here. She basically is just recovering from her turn and going into another basic step as a transition, but she didn't just drop her arms, she didn't just let them fall or do something too casual or loose. She's doing this really interesting pattern where she's bringing this arm up and back and this one across her body and it looks really nice and keeps her dancing through her transitions which we all pretty much always want to see. So she's already begun turning her upper body before she's even fully prepped her feet And so that tells me that she's not really thinking about the initiation of her turn here From the feet or from the pelvis Which is not a good sign that's not turning from the upper body because it's so relatively loose Compared to this part of the body and also not as strong And also up higher away from the floor It's just a weaker way to turn so I'd recommend she keep her torso straight forward her gaze straight forward here until her feet are Fully planted and ready to prep her for her turn because this is a good turn prep position for the feet But she's already started turning before prepping also She's turning her head with her upper body, which is not typically good turn technique unless she's planning to spot towards the upstage But typically at this point I would recommend that the gaze stayed down Stage where she's gonna end up and her at the end of her turn I think she probably forgot what she's supposed to do here and then remembered at the last second because there's just not a lot of dynamism through this motion. There's not a lot of exaggeration. The arm shapes are quite weak and vague. So is the leg shape actually. There's not a plie here. So I think she probably forgot what she's supposed to do. So just recommending that, you know, she keep dancing through those mistakes. At least she didn't reveal it on her face or make a sound. She just kind of kept going, which is good. But to find ways to really keep it, keep it looking interesting, even if it's not exactly what she meant to do. She's continuing this undulating movement, but has turned her gaze and her whole facing more towards the upstage right And I don't really like like that. I wish that she would have just kept it really strong and facing her audience this kind of again like it disconnects her from her viewer Unfortunately again, lacks follow-through. This is the second repetition of this jump and she never quite hits this shape like she did before or like she could. This arm is clearly the elbow is more bent because the hand is more straight above her here, whereas before it was coming out at a diagonal which was really nice. There's not a lot of energy at her fingertips here. There's also a heaviness to the way that she lands here. Maybe she needs a bit more plie, but regardless she doesn't actually find the shape and hold it long enough for it to read as a shape. It looks a little throwaway. Again, this transition is quite awkward. She finds a sort of a stillness before moving into the jump again here in this repetition of this jump. So, again, encouraging her to continue dancing through all her transitions. Here she's doing a great job of using the side of her body to bring this knee up and around in front of her and this is a really nice shape here and actually this arm forward like this is a really nice shape. I'd like to see a little bit more plie here just to protect her knees and keep a nice cushion and then I'd like to see her head and her right arm doing something more to exaggerate and emphasize this moment. This arm is really detracting from this shape because it's so casual and there's not really much energy or strength through it and also she's gazing downward a little bit which is not helping because this movement has an upward feeling to it and so by gazing downward she's detracting from the upward feeling. Actually this arm is also pulling dragging it down so I'd love to see if she could find a way maybe she just needs to match the arms to be the same or she could bring this arm up or something to just make this to emphasize the upness and emphasize the shape of this movement. She really clearly enjoys doing this shoulder movement and is very good at it. It's very elegant. She's kind of bringing one forward and one back but also they're going up and down opposite each other. It looks really strong. It looks really pretty. It looks really interesting. Part of why it looks even stronger is because the elbows are away from the body so she can really let them react to the shoulder movements. And this is an example of a dancer doing a really simple basic step with the lower half of the body but making it interesting with the upper half. What she's doing with her arms here is really nice. She's kind of windmilling them, which is setting her up for something she's about to do next. She's doing a great job with this undulation that's coming from the rib cage and shoulders. It looks really nice. It looks really smooth. Looks really clean. So here she stepped out with the right foot and brought the left ball of the foot in to meet it here. A few good things about this one is that she's using this left hip to initiate the movement which adds this nice undulation to the pelvis. She also brought the arms down and up into this position and then at the top of this position she hit a little pulse with the arms which is really nice dynamic change because it goes from smooth to a little sharp just at the last seconds really strong. Gosh, I wish she would have followed through with this arm movement because so far with this step she's doing such a good job. She loses it at the end and unfortunately sometimes that can just detract from anything good that you've just done. She's repeating a step here with the feet. The feet look really good. The follow-through looks great here. She's doing the step as she has done in every other time. And then what the arms have been doing is going forward with one, forward with the other, up with one, up with the other. And this is the last up that she's doing, but she doesn't fully reach the full potential of this shape with the arm. This is the highest that she ever gets with this arm. You can see that there's an angle here where we would really want this to be more straight up in the air. The elbow is also not fully straight and there's tension through the fingers. There's no energy coming out the fingertips. So this is an example of lack of follow-through that again detracts from anything good that she's already, that she's just done. And this is most likely because she's about to do a different step. I would guess that because she's just repeated this four times and we usually are repeating things four to eight times. Choreography repeats things four to eight times. And so she's probably not following through because she's focused on what she's about to do next, which is unfortunate. I just recommend she practice following through with all her movements. So she clearly understands the mechanics of this step with weight on one foot the ball of the foot touching forward and quick movement Side to side with the shoulders and hips. It looks really really really crisp and really nice She's creating poly rhythms between the feet the hips and the shoulders, which is really lovely This arm is really strong coming out quite graceful for the arms through the wrist and fingers This arm is really quite tense here and it's really not in much of a shape at all So I just recommend because she's doing so well with every other part of her body here Let's continue adding icing on the cake and do something more clear and intentional with this arm She did bring her hands pretty gracefully here to her head. She had an extension through the wrist and then gently placed the hands here. I don't like this moment. I don't find it aesthetically pleasing. It doesn't make sense with the rest of the choreography. Like she's never put her hands on her head before or done a shape really remotely like this. So it looks out of place. And also the way her elbows are a little forward, it's almost like, and her neck is forward. She's sort of bringing her head to her hands rather than the other way around. So it makes it look kind of awkward. And you can see that her leg shapes are quite awkward here too with the sickled foot. So she really needs to clarify with the choreographer what's the intention here with this moment and really make it strong and clear. Now that was really good follow-through. This is the follow-through moment here. So this arm had come out to her side and then across her body and she did not bend it until it came very close to her body, which makes it look like a really nice full arc. So this is an example of a good transition between different steps. So this is a pretty successful shape. One reason it's successful is because she did a nice windmill with her arms. This one, this left arm came up and around to in front of her body. And this one came, I think, around in front or out and around, probably around in front. Doesn't matter anyway. It was a really nice shape in the air, which set her up for success in this moment. She's got a nice straight elbow and a nice high arm here, which is creating the illusion of a line from that arm to this toe. She's got a little bit of a plie here. I can see this knee coming out. And she's really got a straight knee here and just on the tips of her toe with her weight on her other foot, which is really nice and adds to the line here. So this is a really good moment. She hits it quickly enough to kind of hold it for a second, which again, allows the viewer to read it as a shape, which is really good technique. So this is the arm shape that she makes next. She basically rushed the ending of the previous arm shape to get here, but this is not a very interesting shape either. So I would just recommend that she follow through with her previous movement and then be really clear and exaggerate whatever shape this is meant to be. It's a little weak here with the elbow bent and not a lot of energy out of the fingertips. This is a really nice shape here because she's exaggerating the curve of her spine here with these very sharp straight elbows and the hands on the sides of the hips with a little touch with the other foot and I like that she's looking over the shoulder. So this is a really beautiful shape. My issue is she doesn't hold it long enough for us to really enjoy the shape. So again, finding the shape, holding it for just a millisecond, find the shape quickly, attack it, staccato dynamic to get to the shape so that she can hold it for a little bit so that we can see it. So she's a little bit inconsistent here with the arms, so actually with the foot as well. So this part of her body, the hips and the standing leg are consistent between repetitions. The first time she did this to the left, however, she was able to bring the right foot all the way towards the left, which she didn't do this time. You can see it's a little behind her. Also her arms are higher and her elbows are further from her body on this repetition, very obviously so. So I really encourage her to keep those shapes consistent, especially between repetitions of the same exact step.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They do still have their right foot on this position right here And then their left foot was on the helix But we can see that it's kind of kicked all the way out and into this direction right here So this is again kind of one of those jerky movements that this clamber Is doing kind of similar to the first move in a move in the middle of the route So by doing this jerky powerful movement It does allow her to create the power that she needs in order to get this movement here. But again, it kind of Creates a lack of control in her movements Because if the clamber was unable to really grab that right hand hold that they're aiming for Their whole body would be coming off the wall just because that left flagging foot is helping to pull them away from the wall So I would always make sure that they are in good control of the two points of contact that they're making with the wall Which is again with her left hand and right foot And then the flagging foot should be placed closer against the wall in a proper flagging position So then that way she has a better control of what's going on with their body here And then here we can see the climber was able to bump their right hand into the next handhold here. So she is still using the same handholds, which is going to be this left hand as well as this right foot right here. So we can see that she's kind of rising up onto that right foot a little bit more in order to make this move. But one thing I did notice that with her left flagging foot, it's still in the same direction here, but it almost kind of seemed like it kicked in the air. And by doing this, this kind of helps to generate a little bit more power so that she is able to complete this move here. But again, by creating kind of like jerky movements, it does make it hard to complete and really control some of your movements sometimes. So I would definitely encourage this climber to really fine-tune like her flagging foot and her body overall. So that way she's focusing on pivoting and rotating around her feet and letting her legs kind of produce those powers as opposed to other body parts kind of kicking and swinging around because that can just kind of help to pull her away from all if she's not controlling it at all. And then here we can see the climber is grabbing on to the final hold with the right hand. So in that position they are still hanging on with that right hand as well as, oh sorry, the left hand as well as the right foot. So again they're using opposite points of contact right here and we do see that they are doing a good job of standing up with that right leg which shows that they are utilizing the strength in their leg to stand up taller and get this move here. But again we can kind of see that originally the left foot was flagging in this direction but now it's swinging all the way out and away from the wall. So this kind of shows that the climber is showing a lot of jerky and powerful movement again especially with the lack of control in the flagging foot. So this again can make it very difficult to complete harder movements. Being that the climber is going to a final jug hold right there, it is something that the climber might be comfortable doing. But if the hold was much smaller and had a smaller surface area to utilize, it would be very difficult to be able to control this type of movement that is occurring on this climbers body. So I would definitely encourage the climber again to really have good control of what's going on with that flagging foot because right now that flagging foot is just helping to pull the body away from the wall. And then here we can see the climber was able to move their right hand into the next handhold. So in this position they were hanging on with the left hand and we can see that they switched their feet so now the right foot is in this position here. So again, using opposite points of contact this does allow the climber to really rotate and pivot around the right foot. So they are able to rotate the right side of the body closer to the wall. And this is a really good and comfortable position to see the climber in. So it's nice to see that they're using a little bit more of their lower body for this movement here. So here we can see the Clamorant was able to make the first move of bringing the left hand into this next handhold here. And in this position we can see that the Clamorant was hanging on to a right hand undercling hold. And then they are having a right foot there as well as a left foot. So one thing that I can notice about this position here that as the Clamorant was getting ready to do the move, they were in a straight arm position. And then when they were ready to commit to the move, you can kind of see that they really jerked their body and their whole body was involved in really pulling into the wall and getting into that left handhold. Which is an okay thing to do, but by creating this jerky movement and really allowing her body to stay centered facing towards the wall because we can see that a lot of her body is just facing forward and into the wall. This forces her to have to really generate a lot of extra power so that way she can get all the distance that she needs to reach down to this left handhold. But by using so much power and having to really jerk her body around to do that, it can make it hard to really be precise and consistent with some of your moves. But being that this Clamorant was on a big hold and is moving to another big hold, it was something that the Clamorant was okay with doing. But it would be something to just keep an eye on in future moves. And then here we can see the climber was able to bring their left hand Into the next hole so they're now matched on it and the way the climber was able to do that was by hanging on With the right hand and we do see that they were to place a high left foot And then one other thing that I want to point out is that their flagging foot is now kind of in this bent position here So that just kind of shows that the climbers not really Utilizing her left foot. She's not really pushing away from it So then that way she can get better control over body weight and so what we can kind of see going on as a result as a lot of her body weight is kind of swinging from Left to right and what this does is it helps to put more strain on her hands to hang on to that handhold So this is another reason why that I would kind of Encourage the climber to really be aware of what's going on with their lower body, especially with their flagging foot So then that way they can help prevent any swinging any unnecessary swinging from taking place Because this just helps to take away from their upper body and uses up more energy you And so here we can see the climber was able to bring their left hand, so now matching on the right hand hold. And in that position they were hanging on with the right hand. And then they were able to place a high left heel hook here, and then they did also find a right foot in a higher position that's behind their body. So by bringing in their left heel hook onto the same handhold they were grabbing on with their left hand, we can see that they did a really good job to make sure they placed a lot of their body weight on that heel hook. Because we can see that their knee is kind of driving over into the heel and more importantly we can kind of see that their toes are starting to point downwards. And by pointing your toes downwards it helps to further lock your heel into that heel hook position. And then another fine good thing is that the climber was able to make sure that her body weight was directly underneath their right arm here. So then that way she doesn't have to pull or engage on that right arm as that left hand comes up. And so here we can see that the Claremont was able to quickly match their right hand and they now have their right hand out to the further handhold here. So this is kind of a good position to kind of see them in just because they are hanging on with that left hand still and they have managed to get a high right foot. So because they're using opposite points of contact kind of stacked on top of each other it's helping her to really allow her body to pivot and rotate around that right foot so that she can kind of reach where she needs to do. So one thing that we're seeing is because she is reaching over to the right a lot of her body weight is to the right so to make sure she's in a good balance we do see a proper left flagging foot kind of going out in this direction here and that's again just to kind of get a good balance going on with the climber. So this is a good position to see overall.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So really nice position in a nice correct stance. So here she's just alternating feet and tapping her foot forward and then lifting her arms up left and right and then stretching out left and right. So nice job with the arms keeping them up high. I think her eye contact should be facing forward so not sure why she's looking to the corner but definitely can turn her body to be square to the front. Here, nice job. Both of her knees appeared bent in this area and her heels are off the floor. She is rotating her arms and shoulders correctly as well. So the whole last part I could tell she just wasn't sure of what she was doing. So I don't really want to judge that part. So here in this moment, her leg can definitely go out and if it does, that means this knee could be a bit more. So bending this right knee into more of a lunge can allow the left leg to extend out more. So here, really nice job stepping out. And as you see, she's stepping out. Her arms are swinging from side to side, kind of in the side U position. Her eyes are facing forward. Her hip is kind of popped out a little bit, and she's sitting in her hip to her left side. And the right leg, the knee is bent slightly as she steps out. So here I think is where she was looking to see the correct steps. So she, her energy definitely changed in this moment cause she's unsure. So here, really nice job in both turns where her arms are lifted up really high over her head in a nice shape. Her heels are off the floor. Her knees could bend here just a little bit more if she turns, but otherwise really nice job staying on the music and getting the turns around. Here she's taking three steps and then crossing her arm over as she steps and then rotating to the other direction. I think here she could probably step a little bit bigger and wider and make the movement much larger.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She quickly recovered that by taking those eggshells out. You don't definitely want your eggshells in your mixture. And now she's adding her egg mixture, which previously she was stirring. I would like to have seen her use a fork for that or a whisk to incorporate some air, but instead she stirred this mixture together and now she's adding it to her pan. So here she's checking the edges to make sure they're not sticking. She's using a metal spatula to spread oil over the surface of her pan. And she adds a little oil to her bowl. And now she's got a portion of a thin green chili pepper that she's also cutting crosswise into a small little dice. She's making slices of this onion. It's already been peeled and cut. And it looks terrific. She's done a really good job of not over cooking it. She turned it perfectly. It just seems like she knew what she was doing. Here she uses a technique I very much like, which is using a secondary implement to break your egg instead of using your countertop or the corner of something. This kind of keeps the egg white that could be spreading on the countertop from going anywhere but directly in the bowl you're intending to break your egg into. Now she places a bit of salt in the bowl as well. And there she's made a very successful turn of this omelet. Now, a standard French omelet would not be turned like this, but this is something more referred to as a masala omelet, as indicated by the turn, but also by the chopped, fresh ingredients added at the exact same time as the egg. It is far better to oil your pan completely before adding your ingredients than trying to add it after. And here she's adding a little oil to the edges in hopes that that will be kind of sucked in and help not stick the egg to the pan. And then here she's adding either a turmeric or a curry powder, but another seasoning. So she's layering flavors in on textures, which are the crunchy onion and pepper. And as you can see, it's cooking immediately from these white areas, or not white, but bright yellow areas. Thank you. Something to be aware of is getting your pan too hot and that can happen. Eggs are fairly quick cooking so you don't want to make them too hot too fast or you're really going to have a struggle keeping them from burning or over browning. You can see here her pan is quite hot. And here she transfers her omelet straight to her plate. So here she's placed her cut vegetables in a small bowl and she's adding to it some seasoning. This could be some sort of chili powder. She's using her spoon to spread some of that uncooked egg from the top over the pan. And now she quickly turns those slices 45 degrees to cut again, and this'll give her a little bit of like a small dicer mince. Now pressing into it is never recommended because that does deflate any air that was able to bake it into the egg. So if you're making a masala omelette like this, you want to not press it down. It's typical for people to do that when they feel like the surface is not going to get fully cooked, but assuredly it will. Here she has a small amount of red onion and a small utility knife that she's using on her cutting board to cut the onion", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Here you can see that he is picking up the garlic and green onion on the flat side of his knife or his mallet. This is a culinary expert level way of transferring cut vegetables into either a mixing bowl or a pan, essentially using the knife as an extension of your hand. Here you can see that he is seasoning his tomato mixture with salt as well. This is an appropriate step to take as the tomatoes cook. You would want them to be seasoned. Here you can see that he is using again the chopsticks to scramble his eggs. I would prefer to see a flat spatula or even a wooden spoon to do this process, but he obviously looks and feels very comfortable with this tool selection as it is. The next step is preheating his pan which he does over this gas burner. I believe he set the heat to medium-high. Here you can see that he is cutting his cherry tomatoes in half and again he's working with a very sharp knife which is always best whenever you're working with a dull knife. You're more prone to having injuries or not having a very good cut since the knife is not sharp. Once he peels his garlic clove, he takes the flat side of his mallet or chef's knife and hits the garlic clove so that it essentially smashes it. While the pan is preheating, he adds his oil to the pan. He could have also used either butter or pan spray in lieu of oil. This is to ensure that when the eggs are cooking they do not stick to the bottom of the pan. Once his eggs are seasoned, he uses two chopsticks to whisk them together. I would always recommend using either a fork or a wire whisk instead of chopsticks, but maybe this is the only tool he had on hand. He adds the cooked eggs back into the tomato sauce, which at this point is still fairly watery, but clearly he knows how he wants this recipe to end up. There he appears to add about a tablespoon of tomato paste or tomato sauce before covering it and setting it aside. Also, he adds about a fourth of a cup of water from a tea kettle and I assume this is also to begin the cooking process of the tomatoes if he does in fact want them to be more of like a stewed tomato. However, tomatoes contain a lot of water anyways so adding the additional water is an unnecessary step. The next step is seasoning the eggs and he is doing this with a salt grinder. This is, I do like the idea of grinding fresh salt into this dish, however I would like to see him use a measuring spoon so that he knows exactly how much seasoning to use. You would want to use no more than a fourth of a teaspoon. He repeats this technique with the tomatoes as well. The first step to cooking tomato and eggs is prepping your ingredients. You can see here that he has a wooden cutting board here and a very sharp chef's knife. He's also got a bowl of tomatoes, some garlic, and a scallion. Once the eggs are cooked for 30 seconds to a minute, he transfers them with the chopsticks into this mixing bowl here, and we'll proceed to the next step. Once his pan is preheated, he adds his eggs directly to the oil in the pan and I like that he immediately puts his dirty bowl back into the sink so as not to clutter his workspace. Now he has gathered two eggs from the fridge, which he cracks lightly on the side of his cutting board and then opens them into this mixing bowl. Using the back side of a flat spatula he seems to be pressing into the tomatoes. I assume this is to get them to water out and break apart as they are cooking. Keeping his left hand on the top part of the blade of the knife and holding it against the cutting board and using his right hand to go in an up-and-down motion, he is able to mince the garlic very quickly. This is the expert level culinary technique way to chop garlic. The final step is transferring your cooked eggs and tomatoes into your serving dish, which he does here from the skillet with his flat spatula into this mixing bowl. He finely chops the scallion I'm assuming to use as a garnish but you can see that he has a relative ease with his knife work that is above average for a home cook.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The first time the laces are kind of used here. So we see the toe pointing down and that foot is going to come through the ball generating that little bit more power. We see short approach so the players got to do something to try help generate this power. So they've planted in, kind of jumped into this one, getting down low and getting that leg diagonally out to the side so it can remain a little bit straighter than the left leg currently is and therefore getting more of a kind of a whipping action using the laces as a connection point on the foot. This kick doesn't have a great point of entry but it is hit with a lot of power and a lot of speed. Hard to know whether it would be saved or not. If a goalie hesitates to their right this one is going to go in but if they try guess left and they could easily save this one. With this one here the stance is a lot less neutral. We can see the standing foot pretty much pointing and aiming towards where this ball here ends up going which is the bottom corner. But from the connection on the ball to the entry in the goal is a very good example of a penalty kick. Pretty much unstoppable when you get a ball that far into the inside of the post and the side netting. I don't think a goalkeeper has much of a chance in getting down and across that fast and that far when it's placed there. So looking for a good example of a PK, that one has got a massive chance of going in the goal regardless of who the goalkeeper is. Similar finish to the last one here, just opposite side again, quite close to the centre of the goal with this little amount of power. Just want to see this one a little bit further over into the bottom right and away from this point, especially with that power being low. Gives the goalie a chance to kind of predict and get down in time to make the save. In terms of the approaches of all these shots, very short, not quite giving themselves the best chance to have the best outcome in my opinion. Could be a longer run up, a little bit more patience to set themselves up and therefore they can try to add a little bit more accuracy to the shots. Probably the lowest pick, lowest quality pick of the bunch so far in this video. Very short approach and the ball enters in goalie territory just centered in net, not a lot of power because it's a short approach. Inside of the foot just lofted up there and if I'm a goalkeeper in this one that's an easy catch and an easy save. And then we see the resulting kick placed quite well. However, we see the ankle is coming through before the toe. So if any spin is going to be created on the ball, it's going to be this kind of a spin, which is going to cause the ball to go from left to right, which could end up seeing this ball drifting wide. A better technique that I would like to see would be the foot coming around more this angle and getting more purchase around this side of the ball to create this sort of a curve, giving the ball a bit of an insurance policy. So it could look like from this point to this point, it could look like the ball is headed wide, but the fact that the spin would be on it means that it kind of comes back in and kind of nestles into this side netting area here, making it harder for a goalkeeper to dive across and save. So we think about a goalie, airborne, trying to make that dive over across the goal to make that save. If we hit this, like this player's hit it from kind of a left to right because the foot is facing this way, that goalie has much more of a chance of just getting a nick on this ball. But if we come in around it this way, we create more of a curve around. It's much further away from here to here than it is from here to here. Just to touch on the approach here, just something very small but can be a big telltale sign. Before this player kicked the ball I already knew they were going to go to the right. The reason why was because we see them move slightly in this direction before now coming over here. So if a player moves in this direction they're obviously trying to open up the possibilities for kicking a shot more so in this direction. They're pivoting around the opposite direction of where they want to go. So the player kind of takes a step here, opens up and then steps in to take the shot. So this short approach makes it very obvious just in that one quick step. Again if we take a longer approach we can adjust on the run so if we maybe carve a run even this way coming around we can still then go to the right and it's not as obvious as just a short step and turn into this. So in this video we are going to be looking at penalty kicks. Some of the criteria we will use to judge the proficiency score will be the following. So we will look at the technique and connection in the shots. The power and trajectory generated from the connection. The point of entry upon entering, crossing the line into the goal. The approaching angle and run up before the connection is made. The body shape in relation to the direction of the kick. So straight ahead looking into this first one. We can see a good approach. So the standing foot pretty neutral. Facing pretty central. The player manages to lean. Slightly to their left. This leg is leaning slightly to the left. Body quite neutral. What this allows to happen is, even though the player is facing pretty much straight on on approach. It allows them to open up this right foot. And have that space for the right foot to come through. And to guide the ball into an area which is going to be hard for a goalkeeper to potentially stop. So if we see a goalie in the goal here. That one is going to be hard for them to get across. And save. But also hard for them to predict where it is going. Based on the angle that the standing foot is standing at. And the manner in which the player approached the ball. Again, just seeing a series of rushed kicks here that are going quite central into the net with no real power. I feel like the player has more quality to show and if they take the right steps to set up the penalty, we would see many more quality kicks in terms of their points of entry being closer to the sides. A similar line to the last one in terms of where it crosses the goal line. Not quite as high as the last one, quite low but a similar line. We can see the foot here opened up perpendicular, even wider than where it has went. We talk about trying to curl the ball. If this foot could be brought at more of this angle around the ball to try and guide it with that curve, this shot potentially goes in. So it's just the locking of the ankle, the angle of which the foot is twisted. The ankle is almost coming through the ball before the foot which is never going to help it come back from right to left if anything it's going to push it left to right. I like the stance in this kick here. The player comes in quite neutral, slight bend in the knee, a little bit of a lean back, arms up for balance, which is great. And then we can see the right leg ends up coming in and kind of coming across the body and guiding that ball across the goal, which is great. It's not made very obvious before the shot is taken. However, just room for improvement, and this one would be a longer approach to generate that extra power as there's not much power in this. And then the ball enters this kind of area here. Would be harder to stop should it be placed further over in a corner. So yeah, some good and some not so good in this, or some room for improvement. Overall, a decent connection, good stance. But again, would just like to see this player approach with a little bit more speed and get more whip on the shot and try to get it across into the side netting a little bit more. So the approach in this one, very short. The player consistently not giving themselves a huge chance to adjust their body for more accuracy. Just kind of constant fast decisions, quickly rushing into the shot. We can see this one, point of entry here. Can we talk about a goalkeeper? If they're guessing a side, they just have to fall over pretty fast to stop this one and make that connection with the ball to make the save. So we want to see again, instead of the ball being here, could we be closer to the inside of the post? Just a lot further away from the goalkeeper. The inaccuracy in the pretty central shots right now. I think just down to the short rushed approach. With this one here, a very rushed short approach, kind of one step into it. We see a low power, low entry, low angle on the shot. Can we kind of think about if there's a goalkeeper standing in this area? They try to get down to this pretty reachable, should they guess, to go to their right, to the penalty kick taker's left. Room for improvement on this one would be way over in this corner, trying to keep it away from that central point. Especially with this distance being 7 yards, normal PKs are going to be more around this distance or 12 yard distance.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So here you have the climber grabbing this crimp and you there in the act of this heel picking I think it's because they're locking this right hand off a little bit too much this right arm off a little bit too much It's actually pulling their hips up And that's what's making it difficult for the climber to maintain tension through this heel They also were able to get into this left crimp So a lot of energy being put into what I should do with my hands and not Keeping weight and tension through the feet", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You can see just how sharp of an angle this wrist has. This will cause some pretty serious injury in the future if they're not careful. So any way that we can mitigate this wrist, this wrist angle here is good and this neck should be just a little bit higher to fix some of that.

Extended arpeggiation technique is really good for those with large hands or those who really like playing two notes per string, sometimes even three notes per string. He does it well here.

They are continuing to demonstrate excellent right hand finger style technique as well as excellent left hand technique. You can see the fingers are curved over the fretboard and the fingers that are pressing down are aimed towards the center of the frets, which is helping the guitarist play with a beautiful clear sound quality. Here you can see the left hand second finger is a bit to the side of the string that is needed here. You can also see the third finger is pressing very close to the metal bar of the fret. Same with the second finger. It would help to watch the left hand fingers more when playing this phrase to keep them more curved and make sure they are landing and pressing directly on top of the strings that are needed for the pitches in this phrase and that the fingers are pressed more towards the center of the frets to get the clearest possible sound. Here the guitarist is performing their third piece. They are playing at a very challenging tempo. Their finger style pattern is repetitive. They're playing individual strings at a rapid pace with great accuracy so far. They are continuing to do a great job shifting to different frets on the fretboard quickly while maintaining their even playing speed. The guitarist is continuing to perform this piece with excellent left hand technique, right hand finger style technique, and pitch and rhythmic accuracy. The guitarist is performing this phrase with great finger style technique, a clear tone, and great pitch and rhythmic accuracy. The guitarist has begun performing a second piece. They are playing with great finger style technique, are getting a clear sound on each pitch, and you can see they are continuing to demonstrate great left hand technique. The left hand fingers are curved and are pressing towards the center of the frets that are needed for the pitches in this phrase. It would help to practice and review this phrase a few times at a slow tempo while watching the left hand fingers especially the aim of the pinky to make sure it is landing on and pressing the correct fret and string to play the correct pitch that is needed in this phrase. So far the guitarist has been playing with a steady consistent tempo and here you can see the fingers are more rounded again or curved and they're pressed more towards the center of the fret which is helping the guitarist get a clear sound on these pitches. Again, here the guitarist is demonstrating excellent finger style technique, left hand finger technique, and just rhythmic and pitch accuracy while maintaining a fast challenging tempo and producing a clear sound. Here the tempo slowed down a bit and there seemed to be some uncertainty with the pattern of pitches needed here It would help to practice this phrase and review it multiple times at a slow tempo To get more comfortable with the pattern of pitches and to be able to play it at an even tempo The guitarist is demonstrating great right hand finger style technique. The fingers are aiming for and playing the individual strings that are needed for each pitch with great accuracy. They are doing a great job at performing this very rhythmically challenging section of the piece with great pitch and rhythmic accuracy and a clear tone. The guitarist is shifting from string to string and to different spots on the fretboard with ease. Here the guitarist is doing a great job playing chords with their right hand thumb and continuing to play the rapid finger style pattern with their pointer, middle, and ring fingers on the right hand in between the chords very accurately while maintaining their fast tempo. Here the aim of the left hand fingers was a bit off when shifting to this new chord shape. The guitarists quickly lifted and replanted their fingers more towards the center of the frets to get a clearer sound. At first the pitches were a bit muted. Here the aim of the left-hand pinky could be improved. You can see it's pressing very close to the metal bar again. It could help to move it more towards the center of the fret and press it a little bit more firmly to get a clearer sound on this particular pitch. Here the guitarist is gradually slowing down during the last phrase of this piece to make the phrase sound more musical and the piece sound more finished. The guitarist seems to be very comfortable with shifting to different spots on the fretboard. They just move from home position or fret 1 up to the 4th fret very quickly and continue to maintain their steady fast tempo after shifting. Here the aim of the left hand fingers was a bit off when shifting. It would help to watch the fingers more when moving to this new spot on the fretboard and make sure the fingers are curved and pressing directly on top of the strings that are needed for these pitches to get a clearer sound. Here the guitarist is playing a challenging melodic line while maintaining their fast steady tempo. They are getting a clear sound as their left-hand fingers are curved and you can see here the pointer finger is pressed more towards the center of the fret which is helping them get their nice clear sound quality here. The guitarist is playing a finger style piece so far. They are playing with a clear tone You can see they are demonstrating great left hand position The left hand fingers are curved over the fretboard and the left thumb is on the back of the neck of the guitar Again, here they slowed down intentionally towards the end of this phrase to make it sound more musical and final. It sounded like an incorrect pitch was played here, but the guitarist is continuing on with their phrase and is maintaining their steady tempo. Here there is the slightest bit of a buzzy sound quality due to the aim of the left hand pointer finger. It would help to move it more towards the center of the fret away from this metal bar to get a clearer sound quality here. Here the melody is being varied. There's more variation in the pitch and the rhythm is a little bit more challenging here and the guitarist is doing a good job playing at a steady tempo and getting a clear sound while performing these phrases. They are continuing to play their finger style pattern with great accuracy and speed and they are getting a clear tone even on these highest pitches and frets on the fretboard. The guitar is quickly adjusted the positioning of their left hand fingers and is continuing on with the rest of this phrase trying to maintain their steady tempo. The aim of the left-hand pinky was a bit off at first, pressed on the third string and played an incorrect pitch on the third string third fret. The guitarist quickly moved it down a string to the second string third fret, which you can see here, to play the correct pitch in this phrase. The guitarist is continuing to demonstrate excellent right hand finger style technique throughout these phrases. Their finger aim has been great and they've been playing just the strings that are needed for each patch. And you can see the left hand fingers are curved which is helping them produce a clear sound quality. Here the guitarist is getting a slightly muted sound. You can see the positioning of left hand finger one is a bit off. It is tilted rather than curved and it is very close to the metal bar of the fret. It would help to press more in the center of the fret and keep the finger more rounded to get a clearer sound here.

It's important that once the salad has been seasoned, that the person preparing the salad tastes that salad to ensure that the flavor is balanced. In this case, it appears to be missing half of the dressing components. So with the dressing, you're going to want some sort of oil. In this case, olive oil would be nice. And then balance that with some sort of acid, such as red wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice. And once everything is combined, then you want to make sure that all the flavors are well balanced and make any adjustments at that point to the seasoning. Here the end of the cucumber was cut off and just placed at the top of the cutting board. It is a recommended practice to have a small bowl or other container readily available near your preparation area to put any scraps that are generated during the cooking process. The preparer has finished chopping the onion and is getting ready to chop the tomato. He has left the chopped onion on the cutting board and is going to begin cutting the tomatoes. It is recommended that after each ingredient is cut or prepared that it be transferred to a mixing bowl. This way you've got the entire space of the cutting board to cut with and it will make it a lot easier to finish the tasks. The cut vegetables are now being placed into a medium-sized bowl for mixing. The preparer has cut up what was beautiful cubes of cucumber for the salad, and then he is mincing the cucumber. So by mincing this cucumber, it's really going to create mush, because a good portion of that cucumber is seeds. So what you're doing is destroying the integrity of the vegetable, and for a salad, you want that crunch or that bite to the various ingredients. Here the preparer has taken some sliced onion and is proceeding to chop it up using a chef's knife and using good knife skills where he's holding down the tip of the knife and using his arm to create a rocking motion with the knife to cut the sliced onion. Now an easier way to do this would be to start with either a whole or half an onion. If you're starting with a whole onion, cut it in half, pole to pole, stem to root. Peel it and then make vertical cuts with the point of the knife towards the root but not cutting all the way through the back of the onion. Your vertical cuts are going to be spaced depending on the size of the dice you want. So once you've made your vertical cuts, you're going to turn the onion 90 degrees and cut 90 degrees to the vertical cut, spacing the size you want your dice. And that will give you diced onion very quickly. The preparer takes the cucumber and cuts lengthwise into quarters. He then cuts 90 degrees to the lengthwise cuts, creating basically a dice of the cucumber. A safer way to do this would have been to cut lengthwise, place the flat halves of the cucumber on the cutting board, make your second lengthwise cut, and then cut across into the cubes. The hazard, or the potential hazard, when trying to cut anything that is rounded is that the item you're cutting has the tendency to slip, and when that happens, the knife can slip and cause cuts. The preparer is having to use a slight sawing motion to cut through the tomatoes. This is an indication that the knife blade is not sharp. So it is recommended that any time cutting is being done that the user of the knife ensure that it is sharp at the beginning, and if not, to use a sharpening stone or a sharpening tool to sharpen the knife. Here the preparer is drawing the knife blade across the cutting board in an effort to move the onion that he has been cutting. By drawing this knife blade across the cutting board, you are dulling that knife blade each time that you draw it across the board. So a better way to do this would be to flip the knife over, use the spine of the knife to draw along the board and to move anything around.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

So here she does two turns, nice job there getting the arms extended over the head and spinning around. She definitely spotted, so whipping that head around so she can get around with a nice clean turn and she turned on the balls of her feet. So here she salsa steps forward and back. Be careful not to straighten this front leg too much. You want to bend it a little bit. But she is on the balls of her feet nicely and rotating her arms and shoulders. So this dancer has really nice long legs. She definitely showed it in this part. As she kicked her right leg up, it was like a second where it held in place in the air and then she drops it down. So nice job with the balance and really extending that leg up. So here, nice job with the salsa square step before. She stayed on the balls of her feet and kept her knees bent. And then here when she jumps out, the standing leg, the supporting leg right now, her right leg is slightly bent and the foot is flat on the floor to support. The left leg is extended out. The toe could definitely point a little bit harder there. And then her arm is extended out and across in front. And then eyes are stretched forward. So really nice line in the body here. So here the dancer starts, she's taking some steps in place, and she does that on the balls of her feet. And then as she steps out to the side, the leg is slightly bent, and the other leg is outstretched out with the toe pointed. Nice job there. The arm is also stretched out, and she's looking over to the side where her hand is. So nice job with the first steps. So here she reaches that toe, that leg out. So right now she has the right leg, sorry, the left leg extended out. The knee is slightly bent and she does a little hip shake to the side. That can definitely be bigger, but she does extend these arms out and up really well. So otherwise just, I would say, really try to get the mid range of the body moving a bit more. So a little more energy there. And as she rotates her arms and shoulders, I think that's one part where her energy could have been a little bit bigger because it's such a simple step, really get those arms and shoulders moving around as well as the hips can add some movement as well. So here is the dancer's step side to side. I like that when she gets over to the side and is ready to turn, her balls of her feet are planted to the floor and she does a pivot.

This is another position in which the dancer's shoulders are raised too high. They need to be pressed down so that we can see his neckline clearly and it's elongated.

He really should be lifting his chin up and so his chin should be parallel to the floor with his eyes looking straight ahead at the curtain.

So he wants to keep that same energy level up, as well as stepping a bit more on his toes and less on the flat foot, keeping the knees bent. And again, keep that same rotation in his arms. And then a little bit more movement in his neck and like shoulder head movement. When he turns over to his left, it's a little bit slower with his head whipping around.

His knees can be bent just a little bit more but really nice opening for this. So when he turns to his right, it's a really nice sharp snap of a turn so you see his head quickly rip around and get around back to the front.

This is called a knee drop. And for the climber to stay close to the wall, it is necessary that the climber does a knee drop pointing out left with the right leg. Now the climber needs to make sure to keep the center of gravity close to the wall, this one being on the core of the climber. And at the same time is making a pull to engage the arm on a pull up. Now to also help the climber with keeping the core center of gravity close to the wall, the climber has brought the left leg to be out and the foot to tap against the wall to help the climber gain distance and also keep the hips twisted to the right. This leg extended is called flagging out. Here we can see the climber already had started the climb. In this instance, the climber is holding on to one hold with both hands. This is called matching, where the climber at this moment with the right hand is pinching it and leaning over with the left hand as the thumb is above. Here the climber got to the pinch, however, was unable to sustain the grip. The climber lacked at this point from grip strength and potentially was because the climber was over gripping throughout the climb up to this point. At this point, the climber has dismounted due to the lack of grip and also could be for a couple reasons. The pinch is not only sloped but is also open handed which is harder to grip so the climber must give it its all to really hold on to it. Also, the hold is pointing downwards slightly so that requires the climber to have to apply more force to the grip. Another reason is that the climber kept the arms bended which means it's over gripping the holds as the climber was going up most of the time instead of keeping it extended and relying more on the footwork meaning by sending more on the feet while pulling inwards towards the wall. Here the climber has moved over the left hand to the next grip, this one being a side pull. Side pulls are meant to have the opening of the hold over in the opposite direction that the climber is leaning over to. So the opening being on to the left side where the climber slides his fingers in and on to the right the climber leans over. Now the climber is right now doing something it's called foot hop. This one is in order for the climber to switch his feet. As we can see the climber is transferring the weight from the left foot to the right foot and the climber does this in a hop motion to not lose pressure of the foot to not come off the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Also to help move the tea around, that gives it a chance to release the oils and all the flavoring. And then lastly, to get that sugar melted and incorporated into the mixture. He's continuing to stir while that heat has been raised and he's gotten it to bubble almost to the edge here, you can see. He's gotten a very small fine mesh strainer the same diameter as the top of his cup. You can hear the tea so subtly starting to bubble on the edges and when it bubbles on the edges it begins to bubble up. There's always the risk that when it bubbles up that you could have a bubble over, so watching carefully and then knowing what to do next is important. Now he's stirring his mixture and you can hear a little sizzle. Stirring is important at this point because the milk can scald, which means it burns to the base of the pan and obviously it won't make a usable tea that way. Moving it around is the most important thing and using the spoon is the right way to do it. He's adding sugar to the milk in the saucepan. He's placing his saucepan over the heat. He's adding more tea to his mixture, must be a preference thing. That's not necessarily part of the standard operating that you have to add tea twice. He's gotten a spoon. Now he places that with one hand over the cup and strains the mixture through it with his other hand. He's placed his small tassie or cup onto a small plate with a spoon on the side. Now he's turned off the heat. And there you can see the tea is blooming on top of the mixture, spreading out all the tea leaves. And while he raises the heat, he stirs vigorously to combat those rising bubbles so that it doesn't bubble over. He's taking a saucepan from the shelf. He chooses to stir it to calm down those bubbles. The other things you can do are remove the pan from the heat and reduce the heat itself underneath. The bubbles will subside very quickly. Here he's placed his spoon into the cup. He's done this before. And that I would not necessarily recommend because that loose tea might be sticking to the spoon and therefore transferring into the cup. You want that tea to not be in the final result. So this just may be a style thing for him, but in general, I would recommend using a plate or a napkin, something that you can rest your spoon on while you're making your tea. And that'll make sure that none of those small tea particulates will get into his final drink. He's adding loose tea to the milk and sugar. Loose tea is the classic tea that would be used for a milk tea mixture. You can also use bagged tea if that's what you have available. Black tea is the preferred variety, but again, it is a preference up to the person drinking the tea as to which type of tea they want to use. He's raising the heat probably to just add some punches of heat and aggravation to that tea and milk mixture to make it go quickly, make it release its flavors and tannins. He's got a small tassie of milk that he's adding to his saucepan and you can hear a little sizzle when he adds it, meaning the pan's already heating up. And as you can see here, he just has enough for one cup. So he's straining his milk mixture through that fine mesh strainer directly into the cup. He's using a lighting device to light the propane stove.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So whenever that happens, it does force the climber to have to engage their arms Because their body weight is completely 100% on their upper body at this point. So it does make it hard To control this just because they're using up so much more energy by doing that And so I'd always encourage climbers to really focus on Allowing their body to rotate and pivot correctly around their feet So then that way they can help reduce the opportunities of the feet coming off the wall like this And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing the left hand up right here. So the climber was still in the same position of hanging on with the right hand and then I'm using the high left foot. So it's really nice to see that the climber kind of preemptively put herself in a really good position by placing the high left foot. So that's always kind of something that you can think about when considering to use a low foot or placing a higher foot. It's because sometimes if you place a higher foot a little earlier on, it could help you out with future movements. But it's definitely something you want to gauge from Boulder to Boulder because each one kind of requires its own difficulties. So here we can see the climber was able to make the first move of bringing the left hand up into this handhold here. And in this position we can see that they're hanging on with the right hand here. And they do have a left foot behind their body right here, it's kind of hard to see. So because they're using opposite points of contact with the wall, which is the right hand and left foot, this does allow them to rotate and pivot around that left foot, so that the left side of their body gets closer to the wall, allowing them an easier opportunity to reach up with that left hand. So this is a good position to see. The one thing I'm noticing though is that with their flagging foot, that we can see it kind of in this bent position here. So before her movement continued, or before she committed to the move, we can see that her flagging foot was out and to the right. But as she committed to that move, that flagging foot got into that bent position, kind of similar to like a kicking position is what she did. And so this kind of helps to generate a little bit of power for this movement. But by doing that, it also helps to create a lack of control of what's going on with their movement. So with that flagging foot in the direction that it is at right now, it does help to pull her body away from the wall. And so it completely relies on the climber being able to grab that next handhold to get good control of what's going on with their body weight. So this is something I would kind of discourage for climbers, just because it does make it hard to complete harder movements, and especially if you're going to smaller handholds, because you have kind of that lack of control already going on. It can make it hard to have the hand-eye coordination of where to place your hand, just because there's so much going on with your body moving it around. And so here we can see the Clamor was able to bring their left hand over so they now matched on the same handhold. And in this position the Clamor was hanging on with the right hand here and then managed to get a really high left foot here. So I really like this high left foot just because it helps to really push her body weight over to the right. And the reason why that's important is because it allows her to place her body weight directly underneath her right arm. The only thing I wish to see in this movement here is if she allowed herself to be in a straight arm position because right now she's having to pull and engage with the arm which does use up a lot of energy very quickly. So I'd always encourage Clamors to try and keep their arms straight so then that way they can conserve their energies but as they're ready to commit to movements then they can start pulling in. But if you keep yourself in a pulled position it does use up a lot of energy very quickly. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring their left hand over into the next handhold and in that position we can see that the climber was hanging on with their right hand and they do also have a right foot on the wall right here. So as they committed to doing this move here we could also see that their left flagging foot was originally out to the left and we can see that it got kicked over to the right. So again it's kind of this kicking motion that kind of creates a lack of control in the climber just because it's relying on that kicking force to generate the power but because it can also kind of send a small shockwave through the body so it kind of creates that imbalance overall. So again it completely relies on the climber being able to hang on to that left hand in this case to really control that movement. So I would definitely encourage climbers to really make sure they flag their foot in the direction that they want it to be in so that when they're doing this movement they can be in better control and that way they're not swinging around so much. And so here we can see the clamber was able to make the next move of bringing the right hand up into this next handhold here. And in this position we can see that they are hanging on with the left hand there and they were able to get a higher right foot. So again we're using opposite points of contact with the wall right here to be able to reach up to that right hand hold. The one thing I'm noticing though is that she is getting a little bit of rotation going on so that the right side of her body gets closer to the wall, but not too much rotation going on. So we can see that the clamber is being forced to have to pull in with their left arm in order to complete this move here. So what I'm seeing here is that there's not so much focus on the lower body to complete this movement here. It's more on her upper body to be able to complete this move just because her body is more facing forward and into the wall. So this naturally kind of forces her to have to pull to complete the movement. So this does require a little bit more energy and a little bit more power, which might be something that this clamber is comfortable with doing, but it does use up a lot of energy very quickly.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And in this position we can see the climber was hanging on with the left hand here, and they are using their right foot. So they're kind of in a similar position from a previous move, where they're able to really rotate the body so that the right side of the body is able to get closer to the wall. The one main big difference that we can see here is that with the left flagging foot we can kind of see that it's in this kind of kicking motion right here. So this kind of tells me that the climber was trying to create a little bit more power from the use of that left flagging foot. But like I mentioned earlier, by kicking that flagging foot it actually helps to lose the control of what's going on with their movement. So in this case this flagging foot is now helping to pull her away from the wall, even though it did generate some power to help bring her up. It's also now pulling her away from the wall. So what I would recommend is making sure that the climber really focuses on flagging the foot kind of intentionally against the wall. And over to the left. So then that way they can focus more on standing up on their right foot and generating the power they need from that. As opposed to kicking with that left flagging foot. So here we can see the climber was able to bump their right hand up into the next handhold here. So they are in the same position of hanging on with that left hand as well as the right foot. So we still see the opportunity of being able to really rotate their body. And in this case we can see that the climber is doing a much better job right now. Because we can see that the right side of their hip is getting closer to the wall. And again it helps to really pull that movement over to the right which is exactly what she wants to do. And then we do see a really good flagging foot on the left over there. And this helps to create a counterbalance and also to initiate the movement that she wants to get to. So this is a good control to see from the climber right here. So here we can see that the climber was able to make the first move of bringing their left hand up into this handhold here. And in this position we can see that they were hanging on with their right hand here. And they do also have a left foot on the wall there and a right foot. It's kind of behind their body so it's hard to see. But one thing I definitely want to point out about this position right here is the fact that the climber is kind of facing straight into the wall. We can kind of see that they're not rotating their body in any way from left to right or right to left. So what this does is it forces the climber to have to entirely rely on their upper body to pull them into the wall to complete this move here. So what this does is it does use up a lot of energy just because it's focusing a lot on the upper body. So what I would encourage the climber is to really allow some rotation to take place so that in this case I would recommend a leftward rotation so that the left side of their body gets closer to the wall. And this helps to increase or decrease rather the reach that they have to get for that left hand and kind of make the focus on the lower body doing the work. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring their left hand so it's now matched onto this green pinch right here I mean in that position initially the climber was hanging on with a right hand and then managed to get a left heel hook on The hold right here and they do also have a right foot that's behind their body but one good thing about this bent position that the climber was able to get themselves into Is it really did a good job of making sure that the body weight was placed directly underneath the right arm in this position here And that was with the use of the left heel hook which really helps to pull her hip and body up on and away from the ground Which helps to put more body weight on that leg overall and then with the use of that right foot She was also able to transfer her body weight over onto that right foot So this is a really good position to see because we can see that a lot of the body weight was placed on her legs And then her arms were able to stay straight in a relaxed position And so here we can see the climber was able to bring their right hand over into this yellow hold here and in that position we can see that the climber was hanging on with a left hand here and they have been able to find a high right foot and then they're also kind of flagging their left foot out in this direction. So this is a good position to see because of using alternating points of contact which is the left hand and right foot, the climber is able to rotate their body so the right side of their body gets closer to the wall. The only thing I am noticing though is that their knees, especially the right knee, is kind of pointed into the wall here so this does lower the amount of rotation that the climber can do. So it would allow the climber to really focus on rotating that knee even more over to the left so then that way she can further rotate her right hip closer to the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So he is opposite of pose, so he has left hand on, right foot on, he's got this nice kind of side step, kind of flag out here. So this should be a pretty good tension spot, but again that foothold is not very positive. And then the other mistake is you can see he's got his left foot on here and he's gonna end up losing a little bit of tension. So right now it's all good because his hand is doing all the tension here. So his left hand is keeping all that tension and allowing his foot to kind of stay there. But that left hand's an undercling and the top of it's really slopy. And so the moment he takes his left hand off, actually, his foot just shoots off of it. And kind of the nice thing about this hold is that he could set a heel here. So if he set the heel there, he'd be able to just pull straight through that hold against the positive edge. He'd be as perpendicular as possible to that little side. There's a little notch on the side that's really positive. But by towing down, he's got to push all this through. And so it's not really mimicking what the hand is doing. So it's actually gonna, when he loses his tension and it's so sloped, it's actually gonna cause him to kind of cut his feet there. And then I kind of have to have him cause him to latch up to the next hold. So kind of obviously a good start. He's not pulling too much on. He's kind of on this and it's like a posing position so he's pulling you know down with this right hand and kind of inward and upward with this left hand. So he's kind of almost getting compression kind of squeezing in between these in between these two points. But it also means he's gonna have to do a lot of work to create tension to move a hand because the moment he moves one of these hands he's gonna lose some of that tension. So you can see him here he's really loading up those feet getting his feet up high so off to a good start. And we can see, yeah, he ends up cutting here, so he kind of is fully weighted on those arms, but does eventually get those feet back on, but it does cost him a decent amount of strength. You can see he's really looking at those feeds, so he's kind of doing his hand-foot match. He could have done the hand-foot match lower, and that's the only adjustment I'd make, is he's bringing his right foot up here, and he's going to have to end up matching it. He's going to be in this kind of super scrunched up ball position. So I think the move would have been his matching down low, so that he could just bring his left foot up to the high hold right away.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Or continually try to make a very forceful pull up so the climber is able to engage his hips close to the wall. That way when the climber gets to gain height, he's able to place the hand inside the hold. This one would be a closed grip once the climber gets to place the fingers behind the edge. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start, meaning that each hand is holding to its own hold and the right hand is holding on to where there seems to be a pinch as the climber sends the thumb over to the other side. Placing the thumb will help the climber generate more pressure when squeezing the hold. The left hand, we can see how the climber is holding on to a shallow hold so the climber places the entire hand above it. In order for the climber to sustain each grip, the climber will have to create pressure by pulling away on the pinch and keeping the elbow close to the wall once he gets to apply weight onto the grips. The climb will start until the climber places the feet on the wall and is no longer on the mat. The climber here is going up for the reach. As we can see, he has engaged into a forceful pull-up, then to quickly press down on the left foot, that is the one leg that is out on the flag, so that the climber is able to raise his hips towards the wall, this one being the center of gravity, so that the climber is able to transfer the weight over to the highest foot placement. When the climber is going up for the reach, he has looked up to see the hand placement, and in the moment that he's pressing on the toe, the right toe being the foot placed the highest, we can see how the climber is actually being pushed away from the wall. This because the foot is, the climber is bringing the knee into the wall, so instead of keeping it out, this is not a good position for the climber when going up for the reach, as ideally he would have to place the left foot on a higher stance and let the right foot be out on a flag instead, reason why the climber is unable to make the reach up to the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Realistically the climbers hips should be up here, equidistant between these two holds and sort of jump into the position where they can be equidistant. The climbers hips are just too low and too outside to maintain this foot cut. So here we have this brick pinch start and the climber is staring up at the target hold here. In here you have the climber on this pinch. This is what we would call a descending pinch. So basically the taper of this hold, if these vanishing points of the pinch were to continue, it would be like an upside down triangle, which makes it really difficult to grab. If this pinch were flipped upside down, 180 degrees from where it is now, it would taper in and the usable surface would be a lot easier to access. But when it's a descending pinch, you have to grab it a lot harder in order to not slip off. So that's one of the reasons why the climber might be struggling with this sequence, just because this pinch is technically facing the wrong direction, if you can say that about a hold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So whenever he does movements like this, that might be deemed a little bit more wild. He has to be aware that his partner is also on the receiving end. So whenever he moves his body surprisingly like this, it might not be something she's anticipating and would also disrupt her. The dancer can straighten his arm completely here. It would mean he would have to move further backwards with his body and or with his feet so that he can straighten his arm completely. The dancer is doing a good job of bending his knees a great deal, especially since him and his partner has a height difference It helps even out that height difference. So their center of gravity can be closer to each other He claps here with a lot of energy. We're able to hear the clap nice and clear, which is wonderful. He needs to keep that type of energy up, the energy level he has the entire day of the routine is good. It's just displayed here in a different way through that clap. The dancer is also having a lot of fun with the routine here. The way in which he's wiggling his legs here is a lot of fun and a lot of great movement, which is very creative. The dancer is lively and brings up his legs very high or his knee very high here in these crossover walks. His knee is at his hip waist or his hip on his waist level in height, which is great. It's far off the floor. The dancers have good rhythm here, opening their legs on the odd counts 1, 3, 5, and 7, and closing their feet together on the even counts 2, 4, 6, 8. The dancer does a good job here of also making up for their height difference by not extending his arm too high. The arm length that he's extending is good. His partner's arm is bent only slightly but is almost completely straight. Whereas if he was to bring his arm any higher due to their height difference it would be very uncomfortable for her. So he does a good job here of compensating. Dancer does a good job of looking at his partner's eyes here, making connection while they are spinning around in a turn.

Right now he's jumping to his left, and then he's going to jump again to the right. His arms are swinging back really nicely. His head is still up to the audience, which is great. So just a nice picture moment. His knees are bent. Feet are flat on the floor, so he has a nice stable balance. So just really nice glide from side to side. This was a really great advanced choreography. It started off pretty simple but then once you got into the footwork and the movement he was able to execute it really nicely. There were some moments especially in the beginning where he wasn't quite in the music in the pocket of the music and I think that could have elevated his performance even more but overall I think this is a really great example of advanced choreography. And in the next step, he is taking a little step back. So step, step back. I think he started with his right foot and then left. And he's reaching his arms up and around, and then also rolling his body to go back. So a lot of different things working together, but they work together really nicely. So here he does a little salsa step just out to the side with his right foot, but I really like the emphasis on his arms where he is shaking them up and down in front of his chest as well as moving his shoulders. So just for this level, I think it's just nice that he's added so much, so many different like movements and styles in this one little small chunk of choreography and he's executing it very well and each step is very clean and clear and he's able to move on and transition to the next step really nicely. So in the last move he just took a little step over with his right foot and then stepped out left right and then reached his arm across his body and then goes into a nice body roll. So really nice job. And here he's doing a really basic salsa step where he's stepping forward and back. I love that he's rowing his arms, just again adding some extra movements and elements throughout his full body. So here the dancer changes directions and changes position. So now he's facing the left wall fully. So his shoulder is square to the front and his whole body is square to the left wall. Just really nice use of the space in his body and just the transitions again, are very clean into the next step. So here he just stepped out and then did a spin around. It was a really clean turn. He just whipped his whole body around and then had really nice control of his body to step out in this position. His arm is out, the right arm is down. He's in a really nice plie second. So just really nice control out of the really quick spin to land in this plie. So here he reaches his left arm out, and I love that he has a nice blade arm. His hand could be a little bit straighter, his arm could be a little bit straighter, but I think it's okay. He does a little footwork with his right foot. I think the toe went up and out, and then also rolling that full body. So the dancer is starting with just a little step and he's stepping out with right now with his left leg and it kind of slides into the floor back to his right leg and just kind of rolling his shoulders. I love that he is twisting his body a bit. His eyes are still facing forward but his shoulder is reaching over to the right and just keeping his hips as straight as possible and using all of his body in this very simple movement. My only suggestion is to just think about the timing. He's speeding it just a little bit so he's not quite in the pocket of the music. So here he turned around once again and he kicked his right leg up and kind of swiveled it around and then it landed in this position where his arms are really nicely up over his head and a nice fist. He has a small plie and then he twists his left toe so that way his knee kind of twists in and out and it was a real quick like bop bop beat. Just a really nice another nice picture moment movement. So here he just did a little step and he reached back with his, I believe his right arm to kick his left leg behind him. So it just kicked back. And then he did a little head look front and side, which really was nice with the music and that's a little subtle movement where the rest of his body was still and only his head moved and then he moves into the next step. And in the body roll, he's rolling from the top of his head all the way down to the bottom. So if you go from the top, think about moving your spine, your hips, your knees, your feet, and letting that roll go all the way down. So in this move he did a really quick, he kind of like stepped out of the intro part of the song and then moved into I guess kind of like the meat of the choreography. So he took a step forward with his right foot and then did a nice little twist up on his heels. I love that his knees are bent so he's able to be nice and grounded to the floor. Again his eyes are straight forward, his body is slightly tilted to the corner, but all he did was just twist his legs and got his heels off the floor real quick and it was right on the beat of the music. Just a really nice opening for the meat of the choreography. I also like that he's also bobbing his head back and forth, so really getting his full body into the movement.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The climber was able to release the left hand to bring it into place as soon as he drops the right foot from the foot placement. This was so the climber was able to gain height by pressing down on the left toe being in place and the right hand pinching down on the hold. The climber brings the right hand into a match. This one, the climber must show control over his position and his stability while sustaining the hold with two hands in order to hold the climb completed. The climber after bringing the left hand for the next hold, he quickly sends the left hand for one extra move. This is called bumping, when the climber has done two moves with the same hand on the same push stance. The climber is working on a step up start, meaning that the climber, once he places the feet onto the wall after holding onto the grips, then the climb starts. In this case, the climber is holding onto two handhold starts, so each hand has its own hold and they are different. The left hand being a jug, as the climber is able to send the fingers behind the edge of the hold to pull himself and secure the grip by pushing down with the thumb. The thumb is just being in place as the climber engages the fingers on the pull behind the lip of the hold. For the right hand, the climber must apply pressure by placing his weight with the arm extended to create friction at the fingertips of the hand as it's an open hand placement, which is a sloper. The climber is holding to a sloped hold, meaning that it's rounded. Now the climber is applying the feet onto the wall. The right foot is the one that is being placed right now and the left foot will be coming into placement. In this instance, the climber needs to go for the next hold. This one, being slightly at reach, the climber places the left foot at a high stance. This will help the climber when engaging onto a push, stepping up over the hold, and bringing his center of gravity close to the wall so that the climber is able to release the left hand to go up for the reach. Quickly, the climber had sent the right foot into a high foot placement. So then the climber was able to transfer the right hand from the pinch hold and the left hand from the previous hold to now having both hands come and join at the same hold. This is called a match and both of the hands are placed right now on a jug, meaning that there is a large lip where the climber can wrap the hands around it. And now this is a reliable hold so the climber is able to only apply the grips and able to extend the arms to rest as he glances over to the wall. As the climber makes the next move, he sends the right hand onto the rail. This one, the climber immediately applies a pinch grip because he sends the thumb onto the other side of the hold and squeezes the hold to then apply pressure once half gone for the reach. The climber was able to make the reach because he stands up over both of the feet, but the right foot is the one that helps him to gain reach as the left foot is the one that the climber applies to push away so that the climber can remain underneath the hold, pushing him over to the right side. Also, the climber's right, having the right foot position low and the left foot position high helps the climber to have a twist of the body to keep his right side close to the wall, making it easy for him to go up for the reach.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here he's touched the ball out again and is hitting a moving ball. Again, a not illegal penalty kick, but for this instance we're not looking at that. What he's being forced to do as he tries to come around the ball with the kicking leg here is at the very last minute he has to pivot that left hip open and plant that left foot next to the ball. You can see how far left that thing is placed in terms of the direction. It's going this way. He's had to really do that. Then now at the same time he's having to bring his hip will come around here and the foot will come around at the same time too. It's not a very effective way to control where the ball wants to go because he has to do this whole mechanism of turning and pivoting with his hips and his feet and at the same time bring his leg around and hit it. What that's going to do is not give him a lot of consistency on where he's making contact with the ball. This could go anywhere. If he gets it too far wrapped around this side it could go off that way. If he slices down on the ball and only gets a piece of it it could go that way. If it goes forward into the goal it could lack power just because his momentum and the way his body is going is not going towards his intended target. My recommendation here to improve it would be place the ball down central, take a consistent run up into the ball, pick a spot in the goal that you would repeat every single time to try to hit from a target perspective and then use the similar technique every single time whether that's inside of the foot or laces so that he gets good repetition. So here, he's moved the ball around again. So again, I have to recommend that he just be more consistent with the setup of where he's placing the ball down. The ball is stationary, so that's positive. And the one thing I want to point out now is this non-kicking foot. And what you can see in this picture pretty clearly is the direction that it's going is out somewhere in this direction. And what we teach is that that is actually, like where that foot points to be a natural alignment or a natural aligner for your hips and where they face. And we want them to go towards the target. If it's too far this direction over here, there could be a chance that it throws off this kicking foot and number one, where it could contact the ball, but then two, how he follows through. And depending on the surface that he uses, it could cause errors. The ball could slip out and go this way if he doesn't give enough surface. If he hits too far on this side of the ball, the ball could also go wide that direction. So he has to sort of slice at the ball and then follow through that direction just because his foot's planted there. And what that will do, that is actually generate less power. Even if he gets this accurate, it'll be less powerful than what it could potentially be. So the fix here is just get that non-kicking foot pointed and facing the direction of his intended target. The other thing that he's doing now if he doesn't take a run up is that he has no transfer through the ball in the intended direction that he wants to go. What I mean by transfer is his body is standing straight up as he kicks the ball and he's not landing on this kicking foot in the direction that he wants to go. He's almost leaning straight up, if anything, a little bit back too far. What that's doing right away is as he's making contact on the ball in this instance here is that he's following through this way towards the outside of the goal and that's naturally where the ball is going. He's not giving the ball more direction of where he actually wants it to go. Two things here. One is where he contacts the point of contact on the ball and then the direction of the follow through. If you would improve those two things, pick the spot that he wants to kick on the ball every single time and pick the spot in the goal and then follow through towards that intended target every single time. That will give him more success in controlling where this ball goes. Right now it's a little bit out of control and that's why the ball is going wide of the goal from short distance, which is something that shouldn't happen. So this is again just showing the, if he's gonna take an angle of approach that's super like to the side of the ball, this is what it looks like where he has to jump and land with that left foot. And you can see so his foot is pointing this direction, but his hips, his upper body, everything is pointing that direction. And it's just contrasting forces. So there's like the only way he's gonna generate power is by bringing that leg around and having a quick leg action, which is what to be fair what this player is good at is that he does have a quick quick leg action with terms of like the back lift when he brings his leg up and then swinging through the ball. And that helps him to generate power. But he lacks a lot of control of where the ball goes and also the trajectory of the ball. And so like if he just corrected his run up with the techniques like ability that he has to kick the ball to generate power, I think he would be a lot a lot more accurate, a lot more effective in taking these kicks. So the subject is performing the penalty kick where he's placing a stationary ball, should be 12 yards away from the goal. And so this is set up correctly where he's hitting the stationary ball. And the other thing that you can see is that he's taking a short run up by backing up two steps, two, three steps away from the ball to then run up into the ball to then initiate the kicking sequence. This is something that we'll actively watch to look up for as we go through the different repetitions to see if this is consistent throughout. So what we're seeing here is that he took a proper run up to this ball on this attempt here and he's getting that plant foot next to the ball which is much better. It's not behind the ball and he's not coming from the side and he has to rotate his hips. So I think he took a slightly off center angle in terms of his run up. He got that plant foot next to the ball. That's nice. He's got his knee over the ball because he's using his instep so his toe is more pointed down. So I think from a standpoint of the technique using his instep relays that's good. His upper body is a little bit upright for me. I prefer to be a little bit more over the ball if possible in terms of his head down, head over the ball, arms out to the side for a little bit more balance. Like that left arm could be up a little bit more here in this direction. That would help him I think in that sense. But the one thing I'm looking at also right away is that the way in which he's following through is always across his body and what that's causing him to do is slice the ball. So even though he's making a good contact point, his follow through goes this direction as opposed to going towards the goal. So that would be the recommendation that I think he should do is try to every single time he strikes the ball is that he's following through towards his intended target. Just to be clear here, he just touched this ball out and then he's striking a moving ball or a rolling ball. Per the laws of the game, this would be an illegal kick that would not count as a penalty. So, pointing out right away with the second repetition that the original ball was placed in the center. This is where it should be placed every single time. He's already moved the ball over to another place. And so that's the first difference. And the second difference is that he's now taking up a much more harder angle. When I was coming this way into the ball as opposed to before where he was running a little bit more from behind but off center. The biggest difference of what that does is that it will make it much more difficult for him to hit this side of the goal because of the angle of approach. His hips will naturally sort of go like towards this way. So it's more likely that he would try to hit that side of the goal. There's not a problem with that. It's just that because of the angle of approach, a goalkeeper could read that and anticipate a shot to his left side or that side of the goal. That would be something that I would recommend. Number one, put the ball back to where it should be at the beginning every single time. Number two is that practice the repetition that a slightly off center run up and use that technique multiple times. And then that would give him opportunity to hit to the right or left of the goal. But at least the setup would be very consistent.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She kind of stayed right in the same place. So try to really push her legs and her body to jump a bit wider. And so here when she turned she didn't get all the way around front. She kind of had to adjust her body to straighten up. So I think that just meant she just needed to have a little more energy around when she spun around to turn to get her body centered back to the front. So here in her turn here she didn't get all the way around. Again she had to adjust herself so I think when you cross over and turn you have to cross over enough so that way your full body can land front to the to the main front center. So here's a moment where she had really strong arms in this one and the next when her arms come up. Just really nice stiff strong arms for a nice picture moment. So the dancer starts, is also stepping forward and back, stepping forward with her left foot and then also stepping back with her left. And she's moving her shoulders around nicely. So really good job starting in the beginning. So she had a really good body roll in the beginning. I think this one she kind of cut herself short, so try to bend those knees a bit. One leg could be further back, so that way she has a little more stability in her roll. So her legs are kind of split open a bit, but definitely bending those knees, and then she's able to roll from the bottom up. So because this is advanced, I really want her to push a little bit harder. So on this jump where she lands here, I think that jump could have been a bit bigger and really like accent of the music in this part, really throw that arm out and then kicking that leg back. So here when the dancer does the little toe heel dig, I really wanted her to make this a bit cleaner. Just really dig that heel, dig that toe, and then really step out on that leg. It just kind of came a little muffled together. So really being clear because there's a really clear beat. So trying to be as clear as she can on that beat.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The dancers arms are still bent a little bit at the elbows here as well and they should be extended fully with lots of energy He also can help this by pulling up from his head, so from the base of his spine or his coccyx bone all the way up through his head to make his spine elongated and that would also help it be further aligned. The dancer is starting here with a lot of energy before he begins the actual choreography. And that's good that he's starting with this much energy in order to set himself up well for the routine and hopefully maintain this level of energy throughout the entirety of the routine. The dancer is starting the routine with a freestyle here as a way to get into his body, get physically and mentally prepared for the routine, as well as explore and showcase his artistry and creative liberty. Instead, the dancer needs to pull his toes further towards his right so that they are in an actual line with his knee. The dancer is looking downward here at the floor. He should instead raise his gaze and also raise his chin a bit higher so that he's looking straight ahead. The dancer's foot that is being raised, so his right foot, is sickled, meaning that his ankle is not aligned with his leg. If we draw a line straight from his knee, his ankle is diverting in a different direction. It's turned inward towards his left foot. The dancer should straighten his arm here, it's bent, his elbow, and it should be extended, his left arm in diagonal up high. The dancer's spine is tilted a little bit forward while he's turning and instead it should be perfectly vertically aligned so he needs to move his spine slightly backwards so that his spine is in one straight line.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This helps to make sure that in a real game, they can change direction quickly when needed. The player is in the preparation stage to use an outside hook turn with their right foot. Their body is positioned on the left side of the ball. Left foot is planted, left leg is bent with the knee low to the ground helping them balance and getting low in their center of gravity helps them accelerate away when they change direction. The player has rolled over the ball, executing the action well, taking their foot off the ball just as they get to the top, allowing the ball's momentum now to roll, also then allowing them to place their right foot back on the floor and allowing their left foot to follow through and contact the ball for the next dribbling motion. The player is losing control of the ball because they don't seem to have an idea of what actions they're trying to do. They are just linking actions together based on where the ball is. When you don't have an idea of what it is you're trying to do or what sequence you're trying to create, it's very difficult to execute the actions that you want. Players made contact with the outside of their right foot at the same time planting their foot on the floor. This helps them bring their left leg now into balance and then push off and change direction. In second sequence, they then use the inside of their right foot to push the ball back in the opposite direction. The ball makes a little sharp outwards movement followed by a sharp inwards movement. The player has executed a difficult skill, an outside inside. They've sliced across the back of the ball with their laces, making a faint contact and making the ball move ever so slightly to the right. The player has performed a roll over action with their right foot. They've rolled over the ball and taken their foot off the ball to allow the ball's momentum to carry on rolling across them. However, they've placed their foot that they've rolled the ball with in front of the ball's path which will block it and make it bounce up. We want him to place that foot out of the ball's path so it will roll across to the left foot and they can maintain the dribbling actions. The player keeps their eye on the ball at all times. Whilst this is okay for a novice, we would want a higher level player to be looking around, scanning their environment for opponents, teammates and space. The player is taking very small touches with both their right and left foot. These small touches help the ball stay close to the body and therefore when playing in a real game be able to change direction quickly when needed. The player is in the preparation to execute a rollover action with the sole of their right foot. The ball is positioned on the right side of their body, on the outside. This allows space for the player to roll the ball across their body and into the path of their left foot. The player has executed a reverse L-turn with their right foot, but they haven't pushed the ball out of their feet far enough. We want the ball to be further out of their feet, allowing them to accelerate away when they change direction. Because they haven't pushed the ball further enough, it's now stuck under the player's feet and they'll have to use more touches to get the ball out. This just slows them down and is not what we want.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Her chin and neck is tilted a bit forward and they should be in complete alignment with her vertebrae in her spine. The dancer is pressing up here from her pelvis. Her knees are bent at 90 degree angles and she is extending her arms in a straight line, really pressing up into the air towards the ceiling with her left hand spread on the floor which is helping her as a balancing point.

So her bending her back is Making her spine vertically aligned with her head tilting backwards. She's not just tilting her head backwards But her head is aligned with her spine The dancer does not extend her right arm behind her as much as she can.

And the dancer's focus here is very good. She's looking up at the ceiling, lifting her sternum and chest. The dancer could have traveled more into the space on a diagonal. After her leg extension, she moves forward slightly, but she could have made more ground and taken bigger steps.

If we want to utilize the laces, if we're using again inside, outside five, we're gonna have to hit the ball at a higher point just to get our leg into that natural position, but if we're using our laces at this point, you can see now the player is again bending the left leg and his body is leaning back, which means we're effectively now reaching out for the ball. So the distance between ball and body is becoming greater, so it just leads to a little bit less balance for the player, a little less control, makes it a little bit more harder to maintain the control of the ball. You will see as the player's making contact that he's trying to re-correct it through also the contact point through the ball, so his heel is down, his toe is up, so he's now trying to make contact a little bit more with the underside front part of the ball just to be able to bring the ball back towards him a little bit and bring it back into the center of the area. Here a player utilising the outside of the left foot. What you'll see here different to the previous one is we hit the ball at a lower point so the leg is pointing more down on an angle, 45 degrees as opposed to getting this flat surface that we're talking about. What I do like what the player does here is as the player makes contact with this outside surface of the foot, you'll see a little pop through the ball in an upwards trajectory so even though the foot wasn't necessarily flat on contact, that follow through motion helps control the direction of the ball. So it's important that we get the player to bring that lower leg up towards the ball and then based on the surface that we're presenting continue to follow through even if just slightly to help us maintain control and accuracy. We're talking about the preparation of the player with the juggle. So, as the ball reaches his highest point and starts to drop, the player is starting to assess the trajectory of the ball, where it's going to land, what surface he's going to present. So, positive is the player is continuing to move his feet, stay light in his feet as he moves out. You can see as the ball is starting to drop, he's starting to prepare his leg by raising his knee, keeping his lower leg low and then use the lower leg to extend to the ball, as opposed to raising a full straight leg towards the ball, which is going to make it harder to maintain balance and control. Here again, player presenting inside foot to maintain the juggling sequence. The prior action, sorry, played the ball at a higher height to come back down. Positive, the player again, light on his feet, moves his feet so he can get into a position where the ball is within a good proximity to the body. And this allows him now to bring his knee up, lower leg inside and present this flat surface to the ball. So even though the lower leg is not coming up at 90 degrees, just the position of his foot, you can see the player is making contact through the middle of the ball with the inside of the foot. The ball is not really making contact with the ankle or the lower leg like the previous one commentary that we did. So this is going to help the player with both distance from the body, the contact point with the ball. You can also see that it looks like the player is in a good linear position between his body and the standing foot. Arms being utilized, down by his side and slightly out for balance. So the player is in full control during this sequence. Switch to Sight Subtlety. So because the ball is now a little closer to his body, you'll see that the contact with the ball is now at a slightly lower point. The angle of the leg when it makes contact with the ball is much shallower down towards the ground. The thing that I like about the player is obviously the player is raising his knee as the ball reaches its higher point and then utilising the lower leg to move through the ball and present the surface to it. So the footwork here you'll see the left foot pointing that way, right foot going there. So maybe it means that we need to just move our feet a little bit more to regain full control, keep our feet shoulder width apart, working on the balls of our feet so we maintain it. What I do like is that the player again is utilising his arms out away from his body a little bit so that helps us maintain balance even if our feet are a little bit closer together. So here the player utilizes the left thigh to maintain the juggle so the ball is popped up from his right foot. You'll see that the player is raising his knee lower leg down so although it's not directly straight the player helps with that motion by making contact with the ball and then following through in the direction he wants the ball to go to keep the ball going upwards on an upwards directory. The decision to use the thigh is fine the player looks like he maybe felt that his feet were a little stuck to the ground so he wanted to make contact and get the ball slightly higher to readjust his feet but that could be a conscious decision by the player. What I do like is the distance between the ball and the players body so he's not having to really rush in any adjustment he's got good distance to be able to see the pace on the ball the trajectory on the ball and to really make good solid decisions on what he would like to do next. Here again, Player just maintaining the juggling sequence in full control. You see he moves his feet every time he makes contact, bringing his feet back down to the ground and readjusting. He's well balanced with his body through this standing leg, slight knee bend in the left leg. Arms again for balance. Only thing here again, using our laces, I recommend that we bring the ball down to a lower point so we're not hitting the ball at this 90 degree angle from our body. Again, this is the player's in full control, but if we let the ball come down a little bit, our feet now have a little less time and space to travel. So it just continues to help us really stay relaxed, move our feet, stay with the ball and let the ball drop down to that lowest point to continue the juggling sequence. He'll see a slight subtlety from where he uses his left thigh to his right thigh is the placement of the body with the standing leg. So you can see more of a straight line between that. For me it means he's got a little bit more control and balance over his body rather than kind of having to bend his right knee in there to lunge for the ball and have his back going away. So we have a little bit more control over the distance. The ball is still slightly towards the knee. So we want to maybe try and make contact a little bit lower on the thigh through the middle for the underneath of the ball. But I like that the player's now got a better position with his standing leg and his body and maintaining that distance between the ball and his body. It's going to help him with the next action. Here I just want to stress the player is very calm and composed. You can see the distance between the ball and the body is good which allows the player to be very calm and concise with his decisions. You can see the ball is reaching its highest point here around the eye line. His feet are starting to move and adjust based on what he wants to do next. He's focused on the ball. The player is just readying himself as the ball reaches its highest point to then make a judgement on what surface, what he needs to do with his feet. The player is nice and calm, nice and composed in these moments. I just want to comment, so the player's decision saw him really play the ball at a high point. So his leg was coming out at his body about a 90 degree angle in contact with the ball. But you can see the player was maybe able to adjust by hitting the ball higher now in the air that allowed him to bring his left leg back down to the ground, get his feet set in a good position, regain his focus and his control over his body before he now makes the next decision and the next surface and what he needs to do to maintain the juggling sequence. So here just looking at the first time the player loses control of the ball, looking to utilise the right thigh, ends up maybe losing focus, concentration and makes contact with the knee. So because the knee is a harder surface and rounded, obviously presents more of a chance that the ball is going to pop off in different directions. You will see that part of that process is, as we've commented before, the player is kind of bending his leg to reach for the ball but his body is leaning away from the ball. So he's increasing the distance between the ball and his body and he's not fully in full control of his body so we don't have that straight line down from body through the plant leg. So we end up reaching for the ball and this potentially is what can happen. So you're just following on from the previous comment so the players moved his feet initially to get back behind the line of the ball but you can see here as the player is now presenting his chest to the ball you can see there's a distinct curve in the player so the player is not fully set in his foundation with his footwork so we want our feet to be kind of shoulder width apart bending our knees underneath the ball so when we make this touch forward our body is in a more stable position to move with the ball here the ball is going to travel forward as he pops the ball out but his body momentum and the weight transfer is still kind of going backwards through where his feet are so as we move our feet we need to try and get set underneath the downwards trajectory of the ball so we're in more of a kind of straight line underneath the ball bend our knees so then we can lean back and present the chest to the ball to control So here the player is just utilizing a different surface to maintain it. The player could have easily let the ball come down through his laces but now he's presenting the inside of the left foot. With this technique again it's important that we present a flat surface to the ball. If this knee is pointing down, so if this lower leg is pointing down and his foot is pointing down then obviously we're going to risk the ball moving away from the body. So although the lower leg is down you can see that the ankle looks pretty locked and it's a flat surface to the underside of the ball and then he pops through the line of the ball to make the ball go straight back up. So this is a good example of using that part of the foot and again you can see the right leg and the body looks well in line from this angle. Players focus on the ball, good distance between the ball and the body to give him the space to move his leg into this position. I just want to stress the juggling action so you'll see as the ball is starting to come down the player is raising his knee bringing up his lower part of his leg he's not raising his whole leg in a straight position towards the ball which will make it more difficult to control and have flexibility through making contact with the ball the player and he's preparing himself to use his lower leg to move through the ball as the ball starts to lower down so the player is prepped he's got a good knee bend he's already made the decision where the ball is going to drop so he can get himself set with his non-kicking foot again really like that the player is using his arms slightly out from his body to maintain good balance and the distance between the ball and the body is perfect just allows the player to really assess the speed trajectory of the ball So again looking at the players juggling action, so feet shoulder width apart which gives us a good firm foundation and balance on the balls of his feet, knees slightly bent, utilizing a knee bend in the juggling leg, the left foot just to utilize the lower leg to make contact with the ball. You'll see the players making contact with the ball at a very low point, generally what we recommend is to make contact at the lowest point, keeps our feet close to the ground and really helps us with maintaining balance and control. Again distance between the ball and the body is minimal, gives the player a good amount of control, arms out to the side for balance, eyes on the ball making sure he's making contact with the laces part of the foot, obviously we want to try and make contact through the middle of the ball as much as possible and then lock that ankle, keep our toe straight out which prevents a straight surface to the ball to try and make the ball go back up on its vertical. Once again here I just want to comment on the contact point with the ball. So as the player juggles the ball up, gets to around his waist, the player doesn't rush the sequence in terms of hitting the ball too early. It allows the ball to drop to its lowest point possible. So he keeps his feet closer to the ground. This will help the player maintain control of his body and in turn help make control of the ball. You see his feet are decent distance apart and he's utilising the lower part of his leg to move towards the ball, not the whole leg. So he'll raise his knee slightly to begin with, but then the majority of the work is done with the lower leg to flex and straighten out at the moment of making contact with the ball. You'll see the contact point is again through the middle of the underside of the ball. This is going to help get the ball back up in a straight vertical line up in front of the body. You can see that the player is maintaining focus where his head is placed, looking directly at the ball. Once again we'll look at the contact points with the left foot to maintain the juggling sequence. You'll see that the player has allowed the ball to drop to a low point. This allows him to keep his feet low to the ground. This helps with maintaining body balance and control. You'll see that as he makes contact with the ball, he's now extended his lower part of his leg to meet the ball. So it's not a straight leg all the way through the action. He raises his knee, there's a knee bend and he then extends his lower leg to meet the ball. You can see that he's making good contact through the underside middle part of the ball which is going to help maintain the direction of the ball to go straight up towards the air. You will see that his toe is pointing slightly up but the initial contact is through the middle centre of the ball. So that's going to maybe add a little bit of backspin as the ball goes up but the initial contact and locking the ankle and that flat surface is going to enable the ball to go straight. Again you'll see he's non-kicking foot, he's in a solid position rooted into the ground but as he moves between contact points he's nice and light in adjusting his feet. Again, make sure his focus is purely on the ball right now so he's really honing in on that contact point with the ball. So here the player has popped the ball back up with his right foot. You'll see after he makes contact with the lower leg of the right leg he brings his feet back down to the ground, gets his feet back planted into the position where he can now reassess, readjust, move his feet behind the ball. You'll see that the highest point of the ball is around the waist area so I would always recommend that the player keeps it anywhere between waist to shoulders to maintain good balance and the higher the ball goes the harder it is for them to maintain the juggling sequence and control. Again you'll see arms are out so although his feet are a little close together his arms are out to maintain balance. Comment again on the position between the ball and the body. There's a good space between the ball and the body where the player now has time to react to the ball. So the ball as it pops up, the ball goes directly straight up. It's got a little bit of backspin on it as we hit the underneath to partly front side of the ball but because he hits the underside of the ball with the laces the ball pops up and then it'll drop back straight down which is ideal for maintaining the juggling sequence. slight subtlety in the technique so you'll see again the ball from the previous action is starting to move a little bit further away from the body because the player has not necessarily moved his feet towards the ball he's now forcing himself to really reach out with the leg what the player is doing well to try and recorrect is adjusting his foot position so he wants to try and get the ball coming back towards his body a little bit not not fully but just a little bit so he can regain his balance you'll see so his toe is pointing up heel down so now he's making more contact with the underside front part of the ball and if he strikes through that ball in that trajectory hopefully the ball will now start to travel back up and back towards where his body is I just want to comment here, so as the ball is reaching its highest point, this is the best moment a player can really assess an aerial ball as to the direction and maybe potentially the speed it's going to drop down. So based on the distance and the angle of the ball. So you can already see here as the ball is now starting to reach its highest point and start to travel back down, you can already see the right leg is prepped in a slight bent position. You can see that the player is already kind of on his balls of his feet, raising that right foot. So he's already preparing for the next service and that's going to help give him the time and space to maintain the juggling sequence. Again, I like that the player is relaxed with his hands. You can see that in his fingers and his arms are not tight to his body or flailing around. He's in full relaxation mode, full control of his body, just really focused in on the ball and the contact with the ball with his feet. Once again I like here the player as he makes contact with his right foot and now he's going to rotate to his left. As soon as he makes contact with the ball he returns that foot back down to the ground and he very quickly prepares his opposite leg. You can see here where he's starting to raise his knee already. You can see his heel is slightly off the ground so that means he's working on the balls of his feet. This just keeps him agile and ready to make the next contact. So as the ball is travelling up the player is readying his feet. Again he's getting his feet in a decent position, arms out to the side so he's containing some balance but as the ball is reaching its highest point the player is already assessing and getting ready for the next action with the foot that he's going to prepare to continue the juggling sequence. Here the player is just re-correcting so we reach for the last action, hit the ball higher and it's coming back over our head. So what I do like of the player is the player is very quick to readjust his feet to move backwards and keep his body and eye-line behind the downwards trajectory of the ball, which is good. The part where he's going to present the chest to the ball, you can see here that the body as the ball is approaching, we're not fully set with our feet in a shoulder-width position and we've got this kind of curve in our body. So we want a little bit more of a solid foundation when we're receiving the ball with any part of our body so we can really be set, get good contact surface area with the ball and the part of the body that we want to control and we're not kind of leaning off balance on contact. Here you see the player opts to put a little bit more height on the previous juggle. What's positive here you see is the ball goes higher and slightly away. The player is quick to move his feet towards the ball. So we want to try and get into this position where we're making contact with the ball within a relatively good distance away from our body. So we're not reaching for the ball too far. You will see the players opted to utilise the inside of the foot to maintain the sequence. So on contact we want to try and present a flat surface to make the ball travel back upwards. You'll see that we're on a slight angle with the leg. So we'd ideally want to get that leg to meet the ball a little higher so we're in a bit of a flat position. But you can see the player is adjusting his foot position. So he's still presenting a flat surface with the foot. Maybe potentially want to move that leg up and through the ball slightly higher to meet the ball. Kind of on this flat line around his waist. Here you can see the body position with the standing leg. So there's a knee bend which is going to help cushion the control. But then his back is leaning slightly away from the ball. So this is just going to affect our control and balance as we're moving our feet and moving our body as we maintain the juggling action. As we use the inside of the foot you can see a knee out to the side to curl the lower leg back inside to present the inside of the foot with the middle of the ball. Again we just maybe want to meet the ball at a slightly higher point so our leg and inside foot is parallel and flat to the ground. But here he makes the adjustment with his foot position. player utilizing the inside of the left foot to maintain the juggle. So once again the surface we're presenting is a relatively flat surface you can see that making decent contact through the underside of the ball. As the player chooses this surface it's important he brings his leg up nice and early, turns his knee out, brings his lower leg underneath the ball, locks his ankle and makes contact through the middle of the ball to push. You see the distance between the ball and the body provides a player good distance to maintain his balance and control. See also his back is up straight and well balanced with his standing leg so the player is fully in control without the ball which will help him improve his contact points and control with the ball. So here from that ball the player is choosing to utilise the right foot to maintain the juggle. You can see here that the player has maybe misjudged the angle of the ball. You can see the left leg is bending, the right leg is leaning out and his body is leaning back so the player is reaching a little bit to regain the control of the juggle. You can also see where the ball makes contact is the ball is closer to the knee than the middle of the thigh. So we want to try and make contact through the middle of the thigh with the centre of the ball on the underside of the ball. This just helps us continue to maintain full control and accuracy on the direction that we want the ball to go next. Again, just looking at the player, the player is trying to really regain control from some touches and maybe got away from him. Here with the touch with his chest, I like that the chest control kind of popped out and away from his body, but his left foot didn't necessarily move with the ball. So now we're forced to get back into this position where the leg is now out from the body at 90 degrees. So although he's still, he's raising his knee and his leg is in a lower position and he brings his lower leg towards the ball, what we would prefer is this leg to make contact with the ball at more of a maybe 45 degree angle to the ball. So we're not hitting the ball kind of level with the waist, we're hitting the ball on a little bit of a lower point. If we don't move our feet with the ball, it makes it more difficult. Here, player utilizing the inside of the left foot. Again, important when we utilize any surface of the body to juggle that we want the ball to travel on an upwards vertical as much as we can and maintain that distance between the ball and the body. To do that, creating this flat surface is important. If we use the outside of the foot, the inside of the foot of the thigh, we're obviously gonna have to make contact with the ball at a higher point. Just natural in terms of being able to get our leg in this position to show this part of the foot to the ball. So hitting it at the higher point with this technique is perfectly fine. What you will see is through the standing leg, whether the ball got away or not, is we just want maybe the player to be a little bit more centralized over that standing leg as opposed to leaning back, which now leads to a greater distance between the ball. And the body. So here you'll see, as I say, the ball hasn't dropped very far. So now the player is now making contact with the ball with his feet in and around probably just lower than his chest above his stomach. So that is gonna really affect the speed and the time at which he can now bring his left foot back down to the ground and prep for the next one. So you just mean that you're gonna have to hit the ball a little bit higher to give you that time. You can see here that on contact with the ball, the leg is now very straight with the body. So it's like a 90 degree. Ideally, if we're gonna hit the ball with our laces, the leg is probably gonna be on more than a 45 degree angle, because that means that we are hitting the ball at a lower point. And just again, helps us maintain our balance and get the feet back down to the ground a little bit faster. You see here the player is maintaining the juggling sequence, he's utilising his laces. Normally what we recommend with the laces is that we make contact with the ball at this 45 degree angle so we allow the ball to drop a little bit lower. This reduces the fact that the player is now reaching out with a straight leg away from his body at 90 degrees. You can see how far away the ball is from the body to the ball. So the greater the distance, the more we have to reach, the more potentially we get to lose control. You'll see the player is in control of his body just through where his body position is with his standing leg, utilising his arms to maintain that balance. But obviously we want to try and move our feet, get that ball, make contact at a lower point so we maintain our balance and crawl a little easier. Again, players now utilizing the inside of the right foot to maintain. Again as we use the thigh, the outside of the foot, the inside of the foot, we're really looking to present as flattened a surface as possible on contact with the ball and then move a little bit through the line of the ball to be able to make the ball travel in the direction that we want to do. You can see that the angle of the leg, knee bend, bringing his lower leg in, locking his ankle, getting a flat surface towards the ball and driving through it is important to keep the juggle going with the surface of the foot. Again I like that the player is nice and balanced through his standing leg, his back up straight, arms out for balance, so the player looks in good control of what his decision making and technique is asking him to do. Player here controlling the ball with his thigh. You'll see here the ball is making contact through the middle part of the thigh underneath central part of the ball. It's going to help him pop up. Once again see that the player is well grounded through his standing leg with his body up straight, arms out for balance and creating a flat surface for the ball. Bringing his knee up towards the ball to meet the ball is going to allow the ball to continue to travel on that upward trajectory. and player utilizing the inside of the right foot to maintain the drill you can see as the ball begins to drop players making the choice to utilize the inside so we create this flat surface by raising the leg bringing the knee out lower leg inside presenting the inside foot as the inside surface you can see here the player is able to hit the ball at a lower point because the player has a slight knee bend in that left leg which allows him to sink a little bit lower only thing here is the player is leaning back slightly so this just changes our balance and control a little bit but this knee bend just allows us a little bit more time to get that leg into position to continue the juggle with the inside of the foot Here again you see the player just maintaining juggling action with the left foot. You can see the player is making contact with the ball on a 45 degree angle. We can probably allow the ball to drop a little bit lower to the ground so we don't have to raise our leg too far off the ground. You can see the contact with the laces is slightly off centre. This is going to affect our contact with the ball and the direction and potential for spin on the ball as we juggle continue with the left foot. It's important that we maintain our balance and we can see that through our body position in regards to our standing leg. So maybe a little bit of a knee bend in this standing leg to sink our hips a little bit. In general the player is in good control of his body which is going to help him maintain the juggling sequence. Again, just want to focus on the prep action of the player. Before he makes contact, you'll see as the ball is starting to travel downwards, player starts to raise his left knee, lower leg is prepped, foot is getting set in a position, player is centred with his body through his standing leg, so he's maintaining good balance, good control, good distance between the ball and the body. Player's focus is very much on the ball and again you can see proximity between ball and body is good that when we make contact with the ball we'll have that 45 degree angle on contact. Just a quick comment here, so you'll see the player is utilizing his right leg to juggle the ball. You can see his right leg is coming a little bit across his body to his right, so the foot is now on a slight angle as he's making contact with the ball, which is going to affect the contact point and slight follow through in the ball. So the direction of the ball after this juggle can be affected by the position of the foot, the angle of the leg is approaching the ball and the contact point on the ball. So the player maintaining balance through the standing leg, we just want to keep those feet shoulder width apart, try and move this lower leg through the line of the ball straight so we can get the ball traveling up on a vertical straight line as much as we possibly can to keep it in front of us to help us maintain balance control of the juggling action. So just looking at the decision of the player here, so the ball has only just reached this highest point and you can see that the player in this moment is maybe just rushing through his decision based on his leg already being in a, his knee being in a very high position. So now this is going to lead the player to hitting the ball at a higher point. We always recommend that the player allows the ball, if he's using his feet to drop to its lower point as possible just to keep the feet close to the ground, maintain control and balance a little bit easier. So the player is in control of his body but we might be moving a little bit quick, wait for the ball to drop a little bit before we start to get ourselves into this set position. Felly yma o'r cyfnod cynnig, mae'r ball yn ymwneud \u00e2'r trawsodd yma i mewn i'r llwybr. Byddwch yn gweld bod y chwaraewr ddim yn debygu ei fod yn ymwneud \u00e2'r llwybr i gael gynllun chwarae o leiaf neu'r rhan fawr o'i llwybr. Felly nawr byddwn yn defnyddio ei leiaf neu'i chwest.

So you see the player is controlling the ball with the upper right part of the chest close to the shoulder. And this comes obviously from the previous touch, spinning up and backwards slightly. If we're going to utilize the chest as a surface to juggle, what ideally we would do is just move our feet slightly back further, get our feet shoulder width apart and together underneath the line of the ball, get our knees bent so we can kind of sink our hips and get our chest directly underneath the ball to cushion the ball into where we go. Player here doesn't necessarily move his feet quick enough, so he adjusts, kind of lets the ball hit him and roll as opposed to him cushioning the ball and popping the ball back up away from his body to now maintain the sequence. So importance of footwork, getting our body moving with the ball and being able to really bend our knees and drop as we're controlling the ball with the chest, with the head. So instead of letting the ball roll, we can kind of pop the ball back up and away from our body to help us maintain that distance between the ball and our body position to stay balanced and in control of the sequence. I just want to comment here as the player is juggling the ball at a pretty low height, so that's giving him less time and space to adjust. Because of his footwork, he's able to maintain the sequence. Here you'll see his feet are a little close together, so we'd probably like to ask the player to space his feet out so they maintain shoulder width apart. But again, because of the height and the trajectory of the ball, he's having to adjust. But because he's got pretty light feet, he's able to move his feet quickly in between touches. You'll also see that with his feet being closer together, it's now more important that his arms help him maintain the balance, so his arms are out to the side. That just kind of rebalances what he's doing with his feet. You will notice that as he pops the ball up, the ball is spinning back towards the player in terms of its rotation. The direction of the ball is not coming back because he's made contact with the centre of the underneath part of the ball to make it go up. And the spin is coming from that contact and then kind of hitting and curling his toe up to hit the underside slight front part of the ball to generate some spin. Here you see player is making contact with his leg at this 45 degree angle. This is obviously allowing the ball to drop to a lower point. So it just keeps his feet close to the ground, helps him maintain balance and control. So by presenting the knee, rising the knee up, keeping the lower leg down and then extending the lower leg to the ball. Again he's toe pointing out, locking his ankle, pushing through the middle of the ball with the right foot. Staying well balanced with his body positioned to his standing leg. Slight knee bend in that left leg helps him control and cushion in terms of the sequence. Maintaining this consistent distance between ball and body is important. Also utilising our arms for balance and composure is also key as we carry on juggling. Here the player continuing the juggling sequence, light on his feet after each juggle, moves his feet back to the ground, reassesses. I think it's important that as we're juggling with our laces, the top part of our foot, we make contact with the ball at this 45 degree angle. This means the foot doesn't have to travel so far to the ball and then back to the ground. So that's going to help us with our footwork, moving our feet with the ball and maintain our balance. The higher this foot comes away from the ground, the further it comes, maybe we have to reach, maybe lose our balance. You see a slight knee bend in the left leg. You see the player's body position well in line with the plant foot, so the player's in good control. And again, you can see the player making contact with the laces through the middle of the ball. Toe is pointing slightly up, but as he presents the ball, presents that surface to the ball, you can see that the player is maintaining this shoulder width position, extending his lower leg out to meet the ball, making a good firm contact by potentially locking that ankle, getting that toe pointed out to the side to make the ball pop up on this vertical angle. Here I just want to stress again, so the ball is dropping from around the eye line, maybe slightly higher. As the ball is starting to come down, the player has already made his decision on what surface he wants to use. He's judged the distance from the body, the pace on the ball. You can see him starting to prepare his right foot to do it by bringing his knee up, getting his lower leg prepped, ready to move now towards the ball based on the position the ball is dropping into. He's got good balance in his left leg, his plant foot. You can see there's a slight knee bend in that left leg and you can see that the player is not out of balance. You can see that by his back position he's nice and straight, eyes focused and solely on the ball. So the player is in a very balanced and stable position to maintain the sequence. And player maintaining the juggle with the feet, utilizing the laces. You can see toes slightly pointing up because it looks like his toes are pointing out slightly up, ankle locked. We're making good clean contact through the middle of the ball and we're really utilizing the lower leg from the knee bend, the lower leg to move through the line of the ball. So that firm contact with the ball helps us maintain control and quality. See the body position with the standing leg again is important. So that maintains our balance and control, helps us move our feet and maintain this distance between the ball and the body. So we can make contact with the ball at this 45 degree angle as the ball drops to a point where it allows us to move our feet nice and efficiently and fluently, bring our feet back to the ground and continue to move and stay in full balance and control. So you see here the next action, players now being able to regain the control over distance and you can see the angle from the hips now is more of a 45 degree angle which means the player is allowed the ball to drop a little bit lower and we're not having to now raise our lower leg too much to hit the ball at a higher point from the body. And by hitting the ball at a lower point just keeps our feet closer to the ground, limits the time and distance that that left foot will now need to return down to the ground to regain balance. You can see now the player is in more control of his body, his back is straight and in kind of in line with his standing leg and refocused on the ball so the player looks like he's now regaining control by moving his feet to the ball allowing the ball to drop to a lower point. So here the player is utilizing the chest for control. I think the player is forced into using this part of the body because he didn't necessarily move his feet as the ball was traveling upwards. So when that ball reaches its highest point and starts to come down, makes it harder then for us to really readjust and move either backwards or forwards to the ball. We wanna try and move our feet as the ball is traveling up so we can assess the angle and the direction and the speed that the ball is coming back down. What I do like the player is getting his feet set as a bend in his knee, which is gonna allow him to kind of cushion the ball a little bit. You can see him leaning back to open up the chest surface to the ball. And by his arms, I can't see his left arm, but it looks like his right arm is out from his body. You gotta assume his left arm is out from his body. That opens up the surface to make good space for the ball to now hit and maximize the surface area with the ball. Again, players just using the left thigh to present to the ball. What you will see is, not too bad, but you'll see that the player is kind of a little bit off balance. So as he's making contact with it, you can see his right leg into the ground, bending, leaning forward and body leaning back. So this just now forces us to reach a little bit with our left leg and you'll see that the player is making contact closer to the knee. We want to try and make contact if we're going to use the thigh with the central part of the thigh. He is presenting a flat surface, 90 degrees, but because our body is not necessarily straight through that plant leg, it just means we're reaching a little bit and the ball now risks kind of moving off the knee part of the leg, away from the body. So again, on contact with the juggle, ideally we would say hit the ball at the lowest point possible. This keeps our feet closer to the ground, helps us really with our footwork and maintaining control and balance. The higher we make contact with the ball, closer to this 90 degree angle, the further our foot now has to return to the ground. So we just have to do a little extra work to maintain control through the ball. See the distance between the ball and the body is a little bit greater than maybe in previous actions. So this just means that the player is having to do a little bit more footwork to get close to the ball or reach for the ball. The one thing which is important to see is that the player is well balanced with his body and his standing leg, has a slight knee bend in the standing leg, which is gonna help with his balance and control and cushion of the ball as he juggles. Keeping his body in line with that standing leg means that the player is well balanced and full control. So just looking at the players juggling action, take it step by step. So I want to look at the players footwork. Player generally looks to be light on his feet, working on the balls of his feet. Feet are shoulder width apart, which provides him a good sound foundational basis to maintain his balance and control. Distance of the ball between the ball and the body is enough space where he can adjust, adapt and read the positioning of the ball. Also see that his arms are to his side, relaxed and down. This just helps maintain balance and control. Eyes are fully focused on the ball and the height of the ball is kind of in and around that waist area. So this allows us to really just maintain control and balance with the ball. You'll also see before the action, you'll see that the right leg which is going to make contact with the ball next is in a good position, ready and set, ready to move towards the ball by flicking the lower leg of the ball. So this knee bend is important so we're not bringing the whole leg towards the ball, only utilising the lower leg. So here the players utilizing the outside of the left foot to maintain position. The player pops the ball up with his right foot, went a little bit high over his left shoulder. So this is just the players adjusting based on the direction, the angle and the pace of the ball. So the player, because the ball goes a little bit higher, the ball comes around just around head height, he has a little bit more time to reassess what surface he wants to use, does he need to move his feet and has the time now to be able to utilize the outside of the foot if he hits the ball at this trajectory. What this does, it allows the player to bring his knee up, turn his leg and present a flat surface with the outside of the foot to the ball. The flat surface is important because if the angle is down then that's going to lead to the ball bouncing away and it's almost impossible to get that leg too high up to make it come back to the body unless it hits the incorrect part of the foot. What I like here though is the player is really making contact with the larger part of the outside of the foot and not the heel part which is obviously a rounded surface, a harder surface so if the ball is making contact with the heel that's going to have an impact on the direction of the ball, the quality of the touch, we don't necessarily have full control of the ball if the ball makes contact with the heel. But I like the angle of the leg when he's using this surface to the ball, presenting the flat surface through the middle of the ball, maximizing the surface of the outside of the foot to keep the juggling sequence going. So here again I just want to comment on when the ball reaches its highest point, so the moment just before it starts to travel back down towards the ground. You can see after his touch with his left leg, he brings his left leg very quickly back down to the ground. Good distance apart, shoulder width apart, which creates a solid foundation and base to work from. You can already see that the player is already prepping the opposite leg. He's starting to raise his heel off the ground, so balls of his feet, bending his knee, so he's already focused on what he's going to do next. So you can see here the knee starts to raise, bending knee, so he's providing himself options either with his feet or with his thigh with the next contact point. Again you can see the player is really fully focused on the ball and the distance between the ball and the body again is a good distance away that the player has time and space to adjust. Again, the player presenting the outside of the left foot to the ball. You see we're in a higher point because of the surface that he's looking to continue the juggle with. You will see that he's presenting a relatively flat surface towards the ball, getting his leg in this knee bend position and then this flat surface and he's hitting the ball with the outer surface of the foot, not on the heel which will reduce the control so he's able to maintain the ball travelling on an upward trajectory after this touch. I do like that the player's body again is centred through that standing leg so it looks like he's maintaining a decent control and balance of his body. So you can see here, previous few touches, the player is starting to not necessarily lose control, but the ball is starting to travel more away from his body. You can see here on the last touch now that the player didn't necessarily move his feet towards the ball. So as the ball is travelling away, you can see his left leg is kind of set, his back is leaning back rather than maybe moving both his feet towards the ball and narrowing the distance between the ball and the body to maintain full control. As the ball drops down in this trajectory, you can see the position of the striking leg now, the right leg, it's going to be reaching a little bit further away from his body. So it's not impossible to regain the balance and maintain control, just makes it a little bit more difficult. You can see the distance now is starting to increase between the ball and the body, so it's important that as we continue to juggle, we continue to move our feet in the direction of the ball, just to help us maintain that distance, maintain our control, balance and agility. So here we just see the player juggling. His previous touch came off his right shoulder. So we take a bad touch with that part of the body. What we'd like to see is regardless of whether the touch is good or bad is that we continue to move our feet with the ball to help maintain the distance between the ball and the body. So again, it helps us with control and balance. So obviously here you see the player doesn't move his feet. And when we don't move our feet, we now end up reaching for the ball. So that affects the way that we maintain control and balance, obviously seeing from the body position here, leaning back, leg trying to make contact with the ball at 90 degrees, not able to get that toe pointing out flat. So the toes now pointing out reaching. So our contact with the ball gets affected. And then even if we make a good contact with the ball, that's gonna now affect our next action because we're off balance. So it's gonna take us longer now to reestablish our footwork and reestablish our balance and control in general to maintain the juggling sequence. Here you see the ball, he just popped the ball up with his left foot and you see the ball is slightly lower than the waist so he's keeping the ball nice and close to his body. This does help in terms of maintaining the juggling sequence, the higher the ball goes obviously the more pace the ball is going to travel down to makes the control and the juggling sequence a little bit more difficult. What I do like here is as he makes contact with his left foot you'll see he brings his left foot back to the ground nice and quick and he's starting to already prepare his right foot so he's not rooted through the ground in between the previous touch, the ball in the air for it to come back down. The player is already starting to prepare the other foot ready to make contact with the ball. Here again just looking at the contact point on the ball so you can see the player is really making good clean contact with the laces through the central part of the ball underneath. This is going to allow the ball to go back straight up in front of the player. You can see as the player is making contact the leg starts from a bent position and then he moves his lower leg towards the ball. This just allows him to have a good follow through, good flexibility, good mobility as he moves through the ball. You can see that he's got a slight knee bend in his left leg. This maintains good balance and control. You can see his back is up straight so he's maintaining his distance between the ball and the body, maintaining his control and balance and his eyes are focused solely on the ball. So you can see the player utilizing the lower leg, but you can see the player is now at more of a 45 degree angle on contact with the ball. So we're allowing the ball drop a little bit lower, raising our right knee, using our lower leg to move towards the ball, centering ourselves through our standing leg, body straight, arms out of balance so the player is maintaining good control. On contact with the ball you'll see laces, somewhat flat surface through the middle of the underside of the ball, and the distance between the ball and the body has been regained. This just helps us in terms of assessing pace on the ball, position of the ball, be able to give ourselves time and space to move our feet and make the next decision. And just want to emphasize the players decision making process in the timing with the ball. So when the ball reaches his highest point and starts to drop, there's more certainty on where that ball is going to end up. So by being in a balanced position as the ball reaches his highest point, good distance, focus on the ball, allows us to get set. So as his ball now is at his highest point, you can see the player is now beginning to prep the right leg, bringing the knee up, keeping the lower leg down. So he's going to bring his right knee and that's going to allow him that flexibility in his right foot and lower leg to come towards the ball. Again, like the distance between the body and the ball. And I like that the player now rooted through his left leg has got his body back in line with his feet, which means that now we have more control, more balance. Again, I like to see the player not being too rigid with his hands. Sometimes you see players with clenched fists being very tight and uptight. So players nice and relaxed, arms out to his sides, which helps him with his balance. So you see the player is continuing the juggle, you see the player makes contact as the ball drops down at this 45 degree angle. So prepares his leg by bringing his knee up to the ball and then utilises his lower leg to move towards the ball, presenting the laces surface with the underneath of the ball. And this angle maintains a good distance between the ball and the body for the player to really assess the direction of the ball, speed of the ball, contact surface that he wishes to utilise. Also like the player you can see his arms nice and relaxed to the side of the body maintaining balance and control. And players utilizing the outside of the foot. So you see the player is well grounded through his standing leg, with his body up straight. So maintaining balance, presenting a relatively flat surface to the ball. Again, bringing his knee in, lower leg out, and making contact through the outside surface of the ball, not the heel. Because if we hit the heel, that rounded surface, harder surface is going to make the ball travel. So it's important we maintain focus on the contact point between the underneath of the ball and the foot. So the player is, although his leg is on a 45 degree angle, the surface of the foot, and then the slight follow through is going to enable the ball to continue to pop up. Good distance between the ball and the body, just allows the player to really assess what's going to happen next. We see here as the ball starts to drop from its highest point down towards the ground, the player is preparing to juggle with his left foot. So you see that he raises his left thigh, but you can see that knee bend in his left knee. So his lower leg is still remaining down. He's not got a straight leg, raising a straight leg towards the ball, which is going to make it harder to maintain balance control. So the player is preparing to use the lower leg to move towards the ball. And to do that, raises his knee slightly before the ball starts to drop in preparation. You see his feet are shoulder width apart, arms out for balance, eyes focused on the ball. And again, the distance between ball and body allows the player enough time to read the trajectory of the ball, the pace on the ball, to continue to move his feet to maintain the juggling sequence. What I like here is the player in the previous action the ball moves away from the body. So it's off the right knee ball moves forward a little bit. But what you'll notice what the player does is the player quickly adjusts and moves his feet in the same direction as the ball is going. There was a little slight hop for him to be able to recorrect his feet, stay balanced, stay in control. And there we get his body back into a position not too far from the ball. You can see the player now is back in a well prepared position where the ball is on its way down, knee bent, using his lower leg to prep for the ball, looking to maintain. So the good part of here is the player's footwork, how he moves his feet back towards the ball when the previous touch moved away from his body. Felly, rydych chi'n gweld, wrth i'r ball ddechrau mynd ychydig ychydig mwy ymlaen at ei llwybr, gallwch weld bod y pwynt cyntaf gyda'r ball, nawr, yn aros ar y pwynt, ond mae'r lleg, mae'r angl hwnnw yn ddiweddar i 45 oed, a gallwn ni ddangos, a dyna oherwydd y cyfathrebu y ball a'r bod yn fwy ffwrdd, mae'n rhoi i ni wneud cyfathrebu gyda'r lleg hwnnw yn y 45 oed, felly nawr, rydych chi'n ymladd yn ymladd yn y gyfathrebu, yn y gyfathrebu, yn y cyfathrebu, felly nawr, rydych chi'n ymladd yn y cyfathrebu, felly nawr, rydych chi'n ymladd yn y cyfathrebu, yn y cyfathrebu, felly nawr, rydych chi'n ymladd yn y cyfathrebu, felly nawr, rydych chi'n ymladd yn y cyfathrebu, felly mae'r cyfathrebu yn y cyfathrebu, felly mae'r cyfathrebu yn y cyfathrebu, felly mae'r cyfathrebu yn y cyfathrebu. Here the player is utilising the outside of the right foot, so based on the position of the ball, angle of the ball. You can see when we're presenting the outside of the foot or any surface of the foot, we want to try and present a flatter surface as possible to get the ball travelling up. You'll see here the player is not quite able to get his leg in a position when he meets the ball to present a full flat surface, so he's going to now have to adapt and maybe move his foot through the ball to generate that angle that we want to create. So obviously knee bending in, lower leg out, presenting the outside of the foot. You'll see on the contact point with the ball, as the player makes contact closer to the ankle and the lower leg part of the portion, that's going to have an impact on the quality of the contact between the foot and the ball. So we want to try and hit the ball as close to that outside part of the foot, not near the ankle or the lower leg as possible because it's going to impact the quality. So you can see the player with his non-kicking leg and his body is in a good line, so he's maintaining balance and control, but we're also making contact with the ball a little closer to the body, which is restricting the player's ability to get that leg up and at an angle that he can present the surface to the foot that he wants to really generate the highest quality possible. Here just looking at the contact points with the ball with the right foot in the juggling action so the player has allowed the ball to drop from around his waist and he's let the ball drop down towards its lowest point. You'll see as the player as the ball drops down the players lower leg bends from the knee comes out to meet the ball. He keeps his foot in a relatively flat position so toe pointing straight out heel down locking his ankle striking effectively through the middle of the underside of the ball which is going to help us pop the ball back up straight and forward. See that the player is obviously planted through his left leg but the feet are relatively shoulder width apart gives us good balance arms are out to the side again so based on the position of the ball and the player is just able to really have control of his body during this phase. You see these eyes are focused purely down on the ball which allows him to maximise the contact point between the ball and the laces of the right foot. Here, a player utilising the left thigh to maintain the juggle. So again, I like that the player is moving his feet well every time he makes contact, bringing his feet back down to the ground, readjusting. You can see when he's making the touch with the thigh, it's important that we try and get that flat surface to make contact with the ball. Or when we make contact, making sure that we have that initial follow through in the action to present that flat surface to allow the ball to go straight up. So I do like that the player is presenting that surface. You'll see that the ball, you can't see the knee here, which means the ball is hitting higher up on the thigh through the middle. The ball is well in line with the leg, so he's making good, clean contact with the ball. I also like that the player's body is well in line with his standing foot, so he's not leaning back, not leaning too far forward. That means his footwork has generally got himself in a good position, and you can see that the player is in full control of what he's trying to do.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Looking at the player going into his left-handed, Mike can lay up a temp on the right frame to improve and help the player become more efficient on his attempt. It's not having him lean towards the left side of the rim. However, stepping and jumping off his right leg, allowing his body's momentum to carry him forward closer towards the target, allowing a more accurate release, helping the ball travel, hitting our target point. Looking at the release of the player's right-handed micing layup attempt on the left frame, we can notice that the player does well flipping and snapping his follow-through towards the direction of the rim after the release, allowing the ball to create the proper spin and rotation it needs to travel towards our target area, the top right corner of the box on the backboard. Looking at the release of the player going into his left-handed Mike and layup attempt on the right frame, an improvement the player can make to become more efficient is jumping with full maximum effort off his right leg, allowing his body to momentum to carry him closer and forward towards the rim, helping the ball gain more arc accuracy and rotation to travel towards our target point, giving it the proper angle dropping inside the rim. Looking at the player going into his right-handed Mike and Leia Boutemps on the right frame, another improvement the player can make to become more efficient is getting his shoulders squared towards the back of the rim on the release, allowing the ball a better angle of traveling directly towards our target point, helping it drop inside the rim. Looking at the player's release on his right-handed, Mike can lay up attempt on the right frame, an improvement the player can make to become more efficient. His jumping with full maximum effort, allowing his body's momentum to carry him forward. Closer towards the rim, this will allow the ball to gain more momentum, arc, and accuracy to get above the rim, traveling towards a target area, and potentially dropping inside. Looking at the player going into his right-handed mic and layup attempt to help the player create a quicker release and prevent being blocked in the game-like scenario, we will want the player to step and incorporate the correct foot by stepping off and jumping off his left leg, allowing his body's momentum to carry him forward closer towards the target. Looking at the player going into his right-hand dip mic and layup attempt, again to help the player improve on preventing potential turnovers. In the game-like scenario is putting both hands on the ball before going into the release and also bringing the player's ball placement position above his shoulders closer towards his body, allowing more ball control and security going into the finish as well as creating extra protection from opposing defenders. In the game-like scenario trying to strip or take the ball. Looking at the finished result from the player's right-handed mic and layup attempt, we can notice on both frames the player provided the right amount of accuracy, arc, and rotation to get the ball hitting our target point, dropping inside the rim, resulting in the completed layup attempt.

Looking at the player going into his mid-range jump shot attempt on the right frame, some improvements the player can make to become more efficient and to develop a quicker release is to start his body placement position lower in an athletic stance.

We want the player to have his follow-through high above his shoulders, allowing the ball to gain more arc it needs to create the proper angle of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the player going into his attempted jump shot, what can help the player become more efficient on his attempts is to incorporate the correct footwork by either stepping with this left foot first and having his right foot come down second, helping him going into his shooting motion, or the player jumping on two feet, allowing himself and his shoulders to be squared towards the rim, allowing a more effective attempt. As a result from our player's jump shot attempt, we can see that the ball hits the back of the rim, not allowing it to develop the proper angle, arc, and rotation it needed to drop inside the rim, bouncing out, resulting in an incomplete attempted jump shot. Looking at the player in the right frame going into his shooting motion, the player is doing a great job having his elbow aligned towards the front of the rim to help the ball travel towards the correct alignment after the release. The player also does a good job bringing his ball placement position above his shoulders to allow a higher release, allowing the ball to have a better opportunity of gaining power, momentum, and accuracy to get above the rim, developing the proper angle it needs of dropping inside the rim.

Just wanted to be more to push and square himself up and really draw this left hip up. Here's the elevation. He loves to kind of shoot over that right shoulder and you know it's just the ball just got a really long ways to go here. I'd like to see him like use this left foot that when he lands on it to help him pivot and square that right hip and that right shoulder more up to the basket. Again, very little lift and elevation. This is his landing. It could be a little more like a softer landing with more of a cushion and bent knees. Pretty good extension here of the shooting arm there. The ball's in a really good area to go in the basket. Here you don't really see that the left hip come up hard. He kind of brings it around a little bit and you just kind of have a real soft push off here. Nothing explosive. You just want more explosive movement here. This is good. The ball's coming off those pads of those fingers and he's using the backboard, which is a great job there. Again, just move slowly from side to side. We'd love to have more aggression here in this movement. Again, kind of shooting over that right shoulder. It's a little bit better. You don't, you can see the elbow in the picture here, which is better, but I'd like to see more shooting in front of that right shoulder. Again, you can see how he kind of shoots over that left shoulder. See that? I would love for him to kind of square this left shoulder up more and then shoot the ball more out in front of that shoulder instead of kind of around. Again, very little push off in elevation. I mean, he's barely off the ground here. I really feel like ideally I would love for him to go harder and have more ups and lift when he moves to finish. Here he starts to lift a little bit here, pushing off. Here comes the left knee, that's good. Guide hand comes off the ball as he gets ready to shoot it. Here the participant is doing a right hand layup. Going off the left foot, which is the correct foot. I really would love for this gentleman to go basically a lot harder. I mean go what I call game speed and game like. He kind of just kind of pushes off not with a lot of emphasis on getting up off the ground. I mean you can see him push off the left foot here, but there's little rays of the right leg and knee. I really feel like he could really lift and get up a lot higher. I love his arm bar, how it's bent in a 90 degree angle and he's got pretty good lift here. Again I would love for him to shoot a little bit more square and straight onto the basket. Here he does a good job of seeing the ball out of the net, keeps his head up. But let's keep it up here about shoulder level. He's kind of dropping it down to his belly button area. Does a good job with two hands on the ball. Steps through with the right foot, that's correct. But again, we need more of an explosive push-off here to drive this left knee up. Again, we need a stronger push off and elevation in the lift. Let's really pull this left hip up. Let's square these shoulders up so we are not shooting like a hook shot or a cross around our body. Again, just lets the ball drop down. Ideally, as you move from side to side, you get it off the rim or out of the net, you want to keep it up high. Keep those hands and arms up as you move from side to side. Here he lets it drop a little. Again, just real small, tiny steps, like bigger, stronger, more aggressive steps. Again, we'd love to have more drive. He kind of pulls that left knee up and then drops it really fast. We'd love to see more of a follow-through. You can see him, that left shooting hand go down. Let's kind of follow it, extend our follow-through to follow the ball into the net. Again, just small little steps, not real game speed or game-like. He's just, you know, what I would use to tell my players, kind of going through the motion here a little bit. I would love to see more, you know, more like a bigger step with more aggression, pulling that right knee up. He's doing a better job of keeping the ball up higher, about shoulder level, and it looks like he's got two hands on the ball, which as you make that movement across, you want to be able to have more control by having two hands on the ball. Here he crosses over, he does use the correct foot, his right foot, and you can begin to see him pull the left knee up. That would be the correct footwork. However, I really feel like he could get more ups and more elevation if he would really, really push a lot harder off this right foot and really pull with that left hip. He crosses over, he does a really good job of getting his eyes and head up on the on the target, and right now the ball is sitting in the palm of his left hand. I really would love to see that left hand behind the ball with his right guide hand, non-shooting hand, more supportive so that he can bring the left hand, the shooting hand, more around the ball.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Because it's kind of a pinch, you can kind of see that it's... Well one, this first hole she's going to isn't very good, which makes me think that they're gonna have her bump. So I think she needs to go left hand here. So that way she can bump all the way up here to the left hand. And you can kind of see that it's angled this way, so it makes more sense for her to hit it left hand and kind of have her body down here. And her feet can kind of come through like this. And then she can make the moves going up to it. So I think they're trying to force like a bump move. So we can see that just moments before her foot pops, she looks like she's in a good position. Side side of the hand's mixed up and her foot kind of seems to lose tension. So maybe engaging more and thinking more about pushing the foot down and towing down harder, just as if you were grabbing a hold and you were slipping off or like a pinch or something you'd want to grab physically harder to try to stop that slip from happening.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The dancer should also bend her right knee more so that this is more of a lunge position. She can do that by extending her left leg further behind her to widen her stance. The dancer also, once again, needs to take bigger steps. So all of these steps in which she's stepping and touching her toes on angles, the foot that goes outward before she brings the other foot inward, which alternates from right to left, she needs to make that first step outward bigger so that she's using more space. And overall, she's widening her stance with each step she takes. She's also grabbing her left hand onto her right hand at the wrist, which restricts how high up she could bring her arms. Instead, if she locks her fingers at her fingertips instead, she'll have more room to raise them higher up. The dancer's arms here are too condensed or restricted. She needs to make her arms longer in space so that they're higher above her head. The dancer should widen her legs here so that they're further apart, giving her the stability so that she can have more mobility in her upper body. The dancer's right foot here should be further away from her body and not so close to her left knee, more so as if it's on a 90 degree angle. Widening her stance would allow her pelvis to then drop further lower in between her legs since there would be more space between her legs and that would bring her whole body closer to the floor. The dancer needs to make this position here overall bigger.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

So the way he's spinning around in place, I could actually see him leading a partner and also spinning her around as they keep the same steps in rhythm. So I will say when he changes directions from facing the back of the camera to the front, he does that really well without breaking the pose or breaking the timing. Really good job for that part. But I would definitely add some sort of variety, even moving a little bit more throughout the space, adding both arms a little bit more, and just adding the energy up a bit higher because the movements are still looking the same. So from the beginning, he starts off the beat a bit and at this point of the song he's able to catch back on because he takes another step to the to the right. With bachata, the steps are very clear as far as the timing and it's always an eight count step. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. On the four and the eight count, that is when your hip kind of pushes to the side because all you're doing is stepping side, step together, step side, and then your hip kind of does a little bump or just the accent on whatever the last movement is. So to keep the rhythm, you always want to keep that one, two, three accent, one, two, three accent on the four and the eight, you get a little oomph. So overall, I just think this was not an advanced piece of choreography, definitely more beginner because he is showing the basic of a bachata step, but there isn't really much variety to his movement. He does have the gist of the step correctly. So just stepping step 1, 2, 3, and then touch, 1, 2, 3, touch. Make sure he adds a little more hip movement, a little more variety with the arms. He did do a really good job changing directions and facing different ways and doing that seamlessly, but just keeping the beat and the timing is something he could work on. So there he made a slight mistake. He took an extra step and now he's off the music again. So just making sure you're not taking any extra steps. Bachata does not call for that. You have a very clear number of steps that you take and you want to make sure you just take those steps so you don't get off the music. So this one he's doing a good job keeping back up with the rhythm and on the steps. I would suggest maybe using both arms to to move because right now he's really just using his left arm more and then also being up on his toes and then pushing those hips side to side on the four and the eight count.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She cuts off her series of shuffle steps and rock steps to jump her feet together here, which is pretty uncharacteristic for this movement. And she appears to struggle or to do this because she's struggling with the transition and changing the facings while trying to maintain a connection to the rhythm. Overall, she would benefit from practicing the choreography more and having a deeper understanding of how the rock step or the shuffle step can be used to change facings. As the dancer performs this transitional step where she's moving from the back of the space to the front of the space, she seems to struggle with the specificity of the transition. Instead of performing a shuffle step or some sort of step that's tied to the music rhythmically, she kind of just runs forward in a fairly pedestrian manner. You can see her arms are kind of just to her sides in a pedestrian way. She doesn't have much bend in her knees, and she's fairly upright, disengaging her upper body in general. If she were to be more grounded, bend in those knees, drop that pelvis back, and engage her upper body, she'd be able to move through this transition more clearly and efficiently and also be able to embody the rhythm here. Here the dancer is continuing to struggle to connect to the rhythm and embody the rhythm deeply and also finding clarity in her movements. What appears to be an attempt to perform some additional rock steps or shuffle steps ultimately gets really muddled here as she's performing the movement. She performs a series of pedestrian steps that really throw her off the rhythm and overall really struggles to connect to the rhythm particularly through her footwork here. As the dancer transitions into trying to find a new rhythm here, something slower than what she's demonstrated so far, she has a lot of bouncing quality in her movement, which means she has a nice bend in her knees, however, she's really lacking control over her movement. And the bouncing quality that she has, particularly in her arms, in her shoulders, as well as throughout her torso, is really throwing her off rhythm and making it more difficult for her to perform the steps quickly and efficiently. As the dancer begins by performing a series of rock steps and shuffle steps, or what appears to be shuffle steps, she's able to find some clarity in her movement and stay fairly connected to the rhythm as she performs it facing the front of the space. However, once she starts to turn in the space, which you can see here, she really starts to lose both her connection to the rhythm and the clarity in her movement. The dancer performs a transitional step moving backwards and forwards in the space again, utilizing that rock step and a shuffle step. However, she really starts to significantly lose her connection to the rhythm here, as well as the clarity in her choreography. She really starts to lose it as well. It seems like her endurance might be something she needs to work on here, and also remembering the choreography. As the dancer performs this traveling step where she's moving from the back of the space to the front of the space Shuffling and leaning back and then shuffling to the front kicking this left leg forward She could use some specificity in the foot here You can see the foot is slightly sickled which means it's leaning inwards And that's from the result of this kind of popped hip where she's really leaning and twisting her pelvis in one direction Where it's leaning down this way She were to even out her pelvis and also drop her pelvis back slightly rather than twisting it up and forward She would be more grounded and be able to perform the step more efficiently As the dancer is continuing to perform this series of steps, she has her weight on the ball of her foot slightly, which elevates her heels slightly. However, she really does tend to step down on a flat foot, which keeps her from having the agility to move quickly and effortlessly through the space, particularly when she's changing facings. If she were to ensure that her weight stays at the balls of her feet, she keeps this nice bend in her knees and drops her pelvis back, while keeping those heels slightly elevated throughout the step. She would be able to perform it more quickly and efficiently.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The player also did really well at squaring his shoulders again towards the back of the rim, allowing the ball to create the proper angle it needs to be guided properly towards the target area.

Again, our player does really well at having his body placement position low in the athletic stance that allows him to be quicker and more powerful on his jump going towards the right side of the rim. The player also does a great job keeping his eyes locked in on his target to create a better finish. On his release and also create and increase his court awareness if being placed in a game-like scenario to make the right decision on his way towards his reverse layup. As we look at the jumping motion of our player's right-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice on the right side of the frame, the player did a great job of jumping with full maximum effort, guiding his body's momentum towards the right side of the hoop. Also having his shoulders squared towards the back of the rim, allowing the ball to create a better angle of being guided properly towards the target area. As we look on the left side of the frame, we can notice how close the ball is towards our target area, which will allow the player to create a much easier and accurate attempt of guiding the ball properly and having it develop the proper angle it needs dropping inside the rim, resulting in a completed layup attempt. As we look at the player go into his right-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice on the right frame the player does a good job at incorporating the correct footwork by stepping initially with his right foot first, and secondly, jumping off his left leg, guiding his body's momentum towards the right side of the hoop. The player also does a good job of locking his eyes on his target to create a much easier finish on his gather and going into his jumping motion. As we look on the right side of the frame, as the player is going into his layup attempt, a slight improvement again is to bring his ball placement position towards his shoulder area to allow more ball control and security on the finish. Also creating a closer gap to release the ball properly towards the target area and preventing opposing defenders being placed in a game-wide scenario having easy access of trying to strip, take, or steal the ball.

A slight improvement the player can make on the right side of the frame and just to bring his ball placement position a little bit higher towards his Shoulder area to create a much easier finish at the rim with more ball control also creating a smaller gap To release the ball quicker towards our target area And last but not least creating some separation Being placed in a game-like scenario from opposing defenders having access of stripping taking or stealing the ball", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This isn't necessarily part of the choreography, but something that she's adding in to the choreography to make it more of her own and to add an ounce of who she is into the choreography, which is really nice. She's able to execute the footwork here, but in addition to doing the footwork correctly, she is also adding in some arm work that is all of her own. The dancer does a really good job of reaching her long limbs all the way up. And we see that her arms meet each other here. And she doesn't hold back from extending all the way. And that's wonderful that she's able to use every inch of her verticality. We see that the dancer realized that she was off timing, so she's taking a pause here to try to get back onto the rhythm and the dance routine. And she's also looking to the side of the room. We see her eyes all going, drifting off, which is to this corner where her dance teacher might be standing or she's able to see her reflection through the mirror. It's important that the dancer tries to remember the choreography to the best of her ability and not rely on outside sources for the answers. Overall, the dancer executed the steps in which she remembered very well, but those steps were far and few between, so it's difficult to assess her here because most of the time she was forgetting what it is that she was doing. The dancer once again forgets the movement sequence here. The dancer is throwing her arms up. It's nice that they're straight and that again she's using her complete verticality, but she's just throwing them a bit instead of having her arms function as really an extension of her spine. So her limbs should be coming out of the root of the core of her spine and not being just released and flicked in the way that they are right here. That would improve the movement. It is very clear when the dancers legs are together or apart. There's no question which position she's supposed to be in and she's executing each of them. The dancer is looking towards the side when she completes this turn and really she should be looking straight flat ahead forward in completing this turn. I still think she's looking towards the side of the room for cues from perhaps the dance instructor or choreographer who she can peek through at that hole that where the mirror is coming out of the curtain. The dancer just started this basic salsa step going backwards first in space. She did that because she's off the music and behind where she's supposed to be in the dance. In this choreography, actually, this basic salsa step starts with the dancer moving forward first, but she cut that section out because she's behind, so that's why she started backwards first. She's doing a good job of finding where she was in the music and trying to get back into the sequence on where she originally was supposed to be right now. The dancer started this next section of steps a bit late, so she's already off the music in terms of where she's supposed to be for the choreography.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They should make sure that they isolate just the left hand and put it within metronome so they really feel like they're grounded in the tempo. The tempo that they're choosing to take away seems a little bit on the edge and starts to compress a bit. They should just make sure that they can practice it a little bit slowly and more accurately, and that would get the same energy that they want. All these fast nets don't seem to really link together and they're all a little bit too equal when playing. They should try to make sure that there's a longer phrase and that they play them lighter so it flows more. This run that they just played was much more efficient and they had a lot more clarity. This run that they had in their right hand was really not that articulate. They're playing chords beforehand in a perfectly fine fashion, which they're getting a lot of good clarity, but then they're keeping their hand in that same position. They should try to make sure that when they're done playing chords, then they have more playing from their fingertips and get closer to the keys for this type of faster playing. The pianist is utilizing their elbow in a more of a rocking motion to help out their hand to play these bass notes. The balance between the hands here is very rich. Both hands are playing quite fully so it starts to become a bit muddled. The left hand should probably stay a little bit longer but the right hand can be a little bit more articulate so that the balance works well. The penis is doing a trill between both their fingers here. They could try to get them a little bit closer together so that it's more efficient and that they can do it without any fatigue. Again, the coordination between the articulation here is not really working out. This is mainly because they play with their flat fingers, so if they can have a little bit more coordination and be closer to the keys, their rhythm would be much improved. Again, this is another section where it's starting to get a little bit too fast and so you're losing a lot of clarity. The pianist should make sure that they play with a metronome to make sure that as they're playing this whole piece that they're at a very steady tempo. The quicker and smaller notes here are getting lost, which is a good sign that it's a little bit too fast. If they wanted to play at this tempo, they should make sure that they're very efficient with their hands, so they get very quickly into the key and then out, so each individual note is still heard. When they're playing it seems like they're just kind of slapping around the keys, which is resulting in it sounding a bit hectic. They're also going a bit too fast to get the clarity that they want. They should try a little bit slower and try to get more accuracy and it would come across as being more accurate. I guess his hand is coming up really far off the keyboard. If they wanted to have more coordination, they would keep their hand as close to the keyboard as possible. Especially when playing fast, they'll have more control and it will come across clearer. Piazza is doing this pulsing effect in their left hand, that they're putting the weight from their palm into the keys. They could be a little bit more efficient with this if they just kept their fingers on the keys instead of it coming in and out. This descending line could use a little bit more coordination and accuracy. As you can tell, they're coming off really high with their fingers and their hands, which is not helping them. They should try to make sure that they do this very slowly and really see if they can minimize as much motion. The pianist is losing a little bit of clarity here because it's just a little bit too fast for them. They should try to slow it down a bit. Again, because of the tempo that they're taking and how their left hand feels like it's pushing a little bit, that led to some uncoordination there. They should make sure that they isolate both their hands so that they can practice very slowly. The pianist is playing with flat fingers and often just hitting the keyboard with their hands. This isn't the most coordinated way to play. It often results in them feeling like they're rushing or they lose structure out of the piece. The pianist could have paced this crescendo a little bit more gradually, starting softer, and then a little bit more, and then a little bit more, and then a little bit more, just so that it feels like it has more musical sense. The pianists use their hand to slide down the keyboard, doing a big glissando. In the right hand, the pianist has some good technique that they're using the whole hand to come in and out of it. For it to come across even brighter, they can try to get quicker into the key and out of it. Overall, the articulation is really good here. It's just that the left hand and the right hand don't feel like they're always really working together. They should try to play very slowly and with a metronome, so that they feel really, really coordinated, so that when they get to a faster speed that it holds up. They get lost a little bit here and try to find the chords that they need to play. They should try to isolate this section and just play it over and over again so they know exactly where their hand is supposed to go. In this section, the pianist is making good use of their hands, of putting a lot of weight into them. This is good for this section. Whenever they play something faster, they should try to be a little bit closer to the keyboard though. The pianist is utilizing their forearm in a very nice way that they're able to be accurate and jump from one spot on the keyboard to another. The piano has a nice touch in this section and they're getting a lot of good ring from the keyboard. They're keeping their hands into the key which is allowing it to ring. This section could have a little bit more clarity if they kept closer to the keyboard. That would help them be more accurate. The piano should try to play this section with a metronome. It's often rushing and the rhythms start to feel compressed, like there's not a lot of room between them. To get these chords to be as articulate as they are, they're keeping very close to the keyboard and they're using the whole arm and hand to put a lot of weight into it. They're getting a lot of really good sound because of this. The pianist is alternating their hands very quickly to get this fast articulation. This whole section starts to feel like it's rushing quite a bit, and the whole section doesn't feel like it makes a lot of musical sense. They should make sure that the rhythm is very stable, so that it comes across as being a little bit more organized. The pianist should check with a metronome when they get to this section to compare how they started the piece and then how they got this. Right now it feels like it's much faster than how they started it and it starts to feel a bit hectic and out of control. The left hand notes are starting to fall apart a bit. This whole time they've been playing with flat fingers, which results in more motion and more fatigue. They would be able to play consistently more even if they used their fingertips. The piast is using a lot of weight into their hands, which is resulting in a very rich sound. They could still try to play more with their fingertips so that they can still get a rich sound but also have a little bit more clarity and coordination. Again, this line that they're playing is losing a lot of clarity because of their fingers being so far off the keyboard. They should try to keep it as close as possible so when it's clear, then it'll be easier to listen to. These notes that they're playing here are not coming across clearly because they're using the flat of their fingers and their fingers are extended. They can get into the key quicker and have a more efficient movement if they play with their fingertips. Mikanas is losing a lot of clarity here because of how fast and impassioned that they're playing. They should, no matter how excited they get, feel like they have some sort of grounding and some sort of tempo for clarity. These fast runs should start a little bit softer and probably just stay really light, so that makes more musical sense with how they just played the bottom chords. Compared to the beginning when they were using their fingertips to play this bass line, now they're using just their left hand and using the flats of their fingers. It's starting to become less clear and starting to get a bit muddied. They could try to play at a slower tempo, but if they want to have more clarity, they can try to use more rotation from their wrist to help the fingers get quicker into the key. The pianist is getting a lighter touch here for a softer dynamic. The pianist is doing a good job of utilizing their arm to help assist their hand to play these chords as they're descending down the keyboard. The pianist is playing with flat fingers, which isn't the best for their coordination. They'll get more clarity if they were to bring their hand a little bit further up and play with their fingertips. This slowdown that they're doing should be a little bit more gradual so it makes more sense. Right now if you put a metronome to it, it would be very uneven. It should still feel like it slows down progressively so that it feels natural.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And also, most importantly, keep your eyes on the target to be able to finish to any type of contact. And potentially get in ones or even positive outcomes on attempting a layup. Here's a clear picture, left leg, right hand, eyes are focused, being able to elevate. It's pretty good job right here. That's a good aiming point. Being able to hit the box or right outside the box and give it a good chance or good opportunity to go in. You definitely want to dribble while doing this layup drill. This does help give you rhythm and momentum when laying the ball up. I would say standing up kind of high and I think this results in not dribbling whereas the dribble can sometimes organically cause you to get a little bit lower. So I think the center of gravity is kind of high whereas he could have a little more explosiveness if he was to dribble the ball and get down a little bit lower. The angle isn't bad at all. It will allow him to feed the backboard here. Then once you get here, be able to elevate through the net and sit on the other side. I would highly recommend starting that drill a little bit higher so you can go downhill. Very seldom in a game will you go a layup from here to there when attacking the basket and the defenders on you.

She's lost all of the arm embellishment that added nice dynamic quality and rhythmic embodiment prior to this, and is now sticking to some pretty basic salsa steps and keeping her movements very small and tight in towards the body. As the dancer performs a series of turns and basic salsa movements, she demonstrates having a proficiency in this movement language, particularly through the embellishments of the arms, which are folded in front of her and out to her side as she's performing a basic salsa step with her lower body here. She's able to embellish in the arms, adding a nice dynamic quality and creating a polyrhythm happening in her upper body as opposed to her lower body. By demonstrating this use of polyrhythm dynamics and rhythmic embodiment, she demonstrates that she has a strong hold over the movement vocabulary and is able to work at a higher level. As the dancer begins his performance with a basic salsa step and some more advanced movement through the arms, she demonstrates that she has a solid understanding of rhythmic embodiment as well as the basic salsa movements. She embodies the rhythm quite effectively with a nice bend in her knees, her pelvis dropped down towards the ground, and movement all the way from the top of her head through her torso and down to her feet. She also executes polyrhythm in her movement through her arms, where she executes a different rhythm in her upper body than in her lower body, which demonstrates that she is working at above a beginner level. Here the dancer appears to forget the choreography and this is I believe the second time in this performance. It shows that she could really pay more attention to memorization because when she does have the choreography remembered and embodied she's really able to execute it well. However, she struggles to cover up these transitional moments where you can definitely tell that she's thinking about the movement and she gets more self-conscious which is evidenced by this kind of more pedestrian stance with the arms close to the body and looking off to the side again for help or cues. Here the dancer appears to forget the choreography, perhaps looking to the side for help or for cues on the next movement. As she's working through this moment of forgetting the choreography, she really shows it in her body by looking off to the side, and her movements are limited and much stiffer than compared to before when she was dancing. She could benefit from being more seamless as she's thinking while she's dancing and not showing that thinking on her body, and paying more attention to remembering the choreography.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Good footwork, pretty comfortable both sides, although a little less comfortable with the left. He could be a little more explosive in the kind of getting up towards the rim to make it more game-like to get to a 9 or a 10. Solid extension on the left side, looks just like the right.

But instead of what he does, he kind of just casually brings his right foot back behind, creates some tension on the wall, and now it's almost like he's right and left foot switch places, and this kind of balances him out, and lets him kind of just reach up casually with his right arm, and not have his balance or weight shift around too much. Here's another example where he's really got to use his feet. He's on this really thin undercling. So if he pulls in, he's just going to pull himself closer to the wall. So this move, he's really got to drive up with the feet and really kind of pendulum around that anchoring point to make this big long span. So this move really only works with his feet in such a good position and really loading them because those feet come off. He's just coming straight down the wall and off the wall. So right off the bat, I like how much, you know, he's how much movement he's getting out of these holds. So he's pulling up a little bit on them, but I think it's because he's so close to the ground. He's just trying to prevent himself from from dabbing on the ground. You'll notice he starts way up to the right. He kind of hits this angled hold here. And immediately once he gets it, he kind of shifts all of his weight underneath it to try to make himself as straight below it as possible. Another thing too is watching him, he looks at his feet, moves them around, he doesn't do just one big foot movement, he kind of subtly moves his feet, shifts himself into a better position. So like this big reach, you know, his feet go from being way down to the left, so he walks them up and to the right. So now he's once again kind of plumb line underneath this hold, which is going to kind of minimize how much he's got to engage on that side. So now he's kind of in a pretty peaceful, but tensioned position, he's not kind of fighting it, he isn't pulling in, he's able to keep this tension through his arms and then move from it. He's just really engaging through the feet, so really getting into the right position, planting the feet, and then moving from that position, coordinating, pushing down with his feet while pulling with his hands.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Let's keep it up here chest shoulder level. So again, he just moves to the left side with little teeny baby steps. Let's be aggressive with a big old step through on the right foot, followed by that big pulling of the left hip. Here's the follow-through. Kind of short arms adhere.

You know, there's nothing wrong with what he's doing. To make it more game-like, he needs to go with a higher level of intensity and urgency. And here he moves to the left side. He does step on the right foot, which is the correct foot, follows with the left. But again, see how he's got the ball down low around his belly button? You know, you want to keep it up here. You want to make yourself as big and tall as possible. I love how he's got his eyes and head up on his target. You know, he's not looking at the ball, which is real good.

We'd love to see a big step through with that right foot where you see some distance between the feet and then pull that left leg up. Again, steps through with that left foot. You start to see a little bit of a lift here as that right leg follows behind, but I really want him to really push off this left foot and draw that right hip up. He's doing a good job with two hands on the ball as he transitions up to shoot it. His eyes and head are up as well. Let's hold that follow through, but the ball's in a good position here to go in. Again, you know, he's hardly leaving the floor on the shot. Let's lift. Let's use our legs and hips more. Here the shooter is shooting a right hand layup. I love that he's got to follow through here. He's following the ball and using the top of the square on the glass. Again, he's got his body square, which is good. He may be shooting over his left arm a little bit, his left shoulder. Let's square this left shoulder so we're shooting facing the basket. He's kind of shooting it up, kind of around his left shoulder. Again, brings the ball down low, eyes and head are up, which is really good. Let's get more legs here. Let's get more power and lift and elevation. Again, makes good transition here by going off that right foot. Here you start to see a little pulling of the left knee. I really feel like it could be more. I like that he's got his eyes and head up. He's got his guide hand on the side, his shooting hand behind the ball. Here's his actual shot on the left side. You know, I'd love to see he stepped on that right. I'd love for him to pull that left leg and knee up high and get some power here from the legs. But good extension here with the left hand. You see the ball come off those fingertips. It's hitting target here. In this drill, he just shot it on the right side. He let the rebound come down. And you can see, before he transitions to the left side, he brings the ball down really low. He just lets it drop. In this drill, ideally, the execution involves getting the ball off the rim or out of the net by keeping your arms up high. It's also a rebounding drill where you move from side to side with that ball up high at your shoulder level. Here he drops. Again, ideally, in a game situation, you bring that ball down.

And he should instead be ending strongly. The dancer has been doing a pretty good job of staying on rhythm for the entirety of the dance. However, right now in this last forward and back basic salsa step, he rushed a bit. So now when he's going to start his next step, he is maybe half of a count early. He needs to take a breath and slow down slightly. However, when the dancer is moving right and left, he can be using more of the space here. He's doing a good job of being equidistant and returning to the center, but he's not traveling as far as he could to make the dance more exciting. The dancer could also be traveling further forwards and backwards. He has a great deal of space at his disposal. So as long as he's equidistant and gets back to the center, there should be no limit to how far he's traveling forward and backwards. Or the only limit really that there should be is the extent of the room. So he should be taking bigger steps to make his dancing more exciting. The dancer needs to have more energy throughout the entirety of the routine but especially towards the end of the routine he just got lower in energy especially though some of the choreography got more exciting with the spins where it's a basic salsa step but it's a more complicated salsa step than the ones in which he was facing forward and his energy should have been brought higher to match the more complex choreography or harder choreography that he didn't bring his energy to reach that level. The dancer can also make his turn sharper by extending his spine right now. He's a bit crunched We see his spine is a bit crunched here. It's fine that his leg is bent That's not what I mean by extending his spine and being taller. It's just his upper body can be pulled upward just really Standing up completely tall as if you're standing in a chair or sitting in a chair with a Back against the Against the back of the chair right now. It's as if he's slouching forward slightly The dancer needs to articulate his feet more whenever he uses a foot and moves it here. He moves his right foot outward to his right. He should really articulate picking up his foot. I feel as if his foot barely makes it off the ground. And it's good that he is smooth. By no means is he stiff with his leg movement, but his leg movement needs to be more detailed and crisper and more accentuated. The dancer is trying to turn around to the front of the room on flat feet. His foot is flat on the ground while he's turning. It's going to make it harder to turn and also makes his turn a bit weak. It's not as sharp as it could be. He could help himself make his turn sharper by putting his weight onto his toes and picking up his heels off the ground. The dancer has great energy in his shoulders in these toe taps, but he also can be engaging his hips and using them here as well. The dancer does a good job of returning to the center on the dot in the room when he's moving right and left. He does go back to the center position.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I think that more likely this would have looked like a stronger moment if for one her feet were further apart and kind of more under her shoulders or under her hips for a stronger base and also her feet fully flat. She's got her weight kind of forward on the balls of her feet which makes it hard for her to release through her various parts of her body. I also think this would be more effective if she were isolating either her ribcage or her pelvis rather than doing this shoulder movement which looks kind of disjointed and a little bit weak. This looks really weak here as well and it's simply because one, she's not, she's really only moving her neck, she's not moving her whole upper torso, which means that her shoulders are collapsing or her elbows are collapsing inwards so she loses the clarity of shape. That could be really nice here. Another thing and even more importantly than anything I just said is that she's not in a strong position with her foundation at her feet. Her feet are pretty close together so that she's not in a really good balance and also she got a really straight knee here, slightly bent here and so there's really nothing strong or clear about this to help support what she's doing up here. So this turn is not very efficient or effective because she's turning using her hip as her pivot point, which means that in certain moments her hips are turned in towards each other and then in other moments they're turned out. And so in order to execute the turn she has to turn out, out, in, in, out, out, in, in, which makes the makes it clunky because she has to do multiple movements just to do one turn. Also the arms are being raised from the trapezius from the shoulders going up towards the ears which makes this look really amateurish. Here she does this super small movement with a bent elbow coming around her body. It looks like she forgot what she was supposed to be doing and had to throw this in at the last second. It looks super weak. There's not a lot of follow-through. Again, not enough energy through her arm. But also you see her feet are quite close together here, so she didn't really step out with this foot with a nice plie to really add any dynamics to this moment. This is the beginning of a turn that's not super effective and it's because she again didn't plie with this front leg before releasing it from the floor. So what happened was then the weight gets transferred to this foot too slowly so her weight is still actually in between her two feet instead of on her standing leg. And also she's got a totally planted foot here which means that most likely she's going to turn around her hip rather than around the ball of the foot which is an inefficient and not very nice looking way of turning. Here she's preparing for a turn and this is really not going to work very well for her because there's no plie in the front leg. There's quite a deep plie here but the weight is on the front leg. I'm not sure exactly what she's trying to do here. It's bringing her weight backwards actually, her shoulders and her pelvis and so that's going to make her turn less efficient. She's already off balance before she even really starts. Her arm movements here are really imprecise, a little bit too loose again, lacking strength, lacking energy. She's looking down at the floor which is not helping. It's again giving this vibe of low energy. Great job doing this shape here. It was really nice because she brought the arms forward and up to make a nice arc with straight elbows and energy out her fingertips here for one of the first times of this piece. So this is again I'd love for her to embrace this follow-through and this energy throughout the piece. Here again this is the end of a turn so this is a transition that is not working well for her. She's a little bit frozen in place without any interesting or clear shape to this this position. Really weak transition here. She stepped with her right foot in front and then her left or her left foot in front and then her right. It's very slow. It lacks dynamics. It lacks attack. It's kind of not even really she's not super stepping even on the beat here. So she really needs to practice dancing through all her transitions. Again really unclear what's meant to be happening here. The movements are way too small to really be effective. She needs to practice exaggerating her movements in order for it to really read as choreography rather than just somebody who's grooving by themselves. Much better windmill here, straight elbows and they're really opposite of each other, which makes it look really nice. And this is a good example of how to bring energy out the fingertips and follow through with movements. So I'd love to see her embrace that throughout. This is some better dynamics here. She's bringing this arm out and around to her knee. Again, I would love to see more energy out of this arm. I'd love to have seen it come straight out and around, but the attack was better for her. This is an interesting and unusual shape, and again, there's just not enough energy and oomph coming out with this knee. It didn't come up very quickly. She's not doing any twists or anything with her torso. She's still just looking forward, so it really lacks that performance quality. Great follow through here as well. So she's turned around and brought this arm with her and this looks really strong this is an example of how to exaggerate movement so that it looks like a consistent cohesive piece of choreography and not a bunch of transition move moments This is an example of good follow-through with the arm, so I'd love her to embrace this follow-through throughout the piece. What she did is she brought this arm up in front of her, actually her hand, in front of her face and then behind her head and completed that arc before bringing this one and doing the same thing. You can see here she's completing the arc here of this arm coming up and around. So that was a great example of good follow-through. Way too slow so she brought her arms up here really just slowly it doesn't fit with the music The music has a really kind of sharp moment to it The shape is really nice But she lacks the the texture and the dynamic of getting there on that music precisely with a really nice shape And so again, it looks super low energy almost like she's bored And if she's bored, we're bored. And so it's really important just to really she needs just Bring energy out her fingertips She needs to exaggerate and maybe that means that she's rehearsing that she doesn't do everything perfectly She lets go a little bit and maybe can't it's a little messy while she's rehearsing Because then she can draw she can prune it back rather than us having to bring more out of her This is a pretty good start to this turn where she's leapt onto this foot and is bringing the other one around her. I'd love to have seen her get a bit more plie through this foot before transferring her weight here so that in this moment she would still be in the air rather than already have landed and would also have this leg in the air. That would again be what I keep saying for her exaggerated movement so that it would look more intentional and strong. Also the arms are the elbows are slightly bent here and so that's also detracting from the shapiness that she could achieve here. So here she started the choreography and this is an example of the main critique I have of this dancer. She doesn't really move her whole body with a lot of energy coming out her core the whole time and so what happens then is she doesn't do the movement fully and doesn't follow through with the movement. So this is meant to be a kick. She did a tiny little kick but barely gets her leg out here. It doesn't really lift off the floor very much. It just barely just a little bit of a flick here. Also not well balanced with the arms. The arms are just again too weak and not exaggerated enough. Her chin is a little bit jutted forward which makes it look awkward. So it's too small to really read as a performance. It just kind of gives this sort of casual low-energy vibe which is not super interesting to watch as an audience member. Little bit jerky here as well in this little transition step. Again, not enough energy, not enough exaggeration. Again, lack of attack, lack of dynamics. She's sort of just walking in this kind of casual pedestrian way. Not a lot of energy through her, any of her limbs. And so it's just frankly a little bit boring to watch. She needs to bring more oomph, more energy, more attack to what she's doing so that it's interesting for her viewer. I think she was probably supposed to do a shimmy here. She was just moving her elbows though, not her shoulders. The elbow movements looked good, but if she was meant to be doing a shimmy, she's not really understanding how to do a shimmy. A shimmy comes from the shoulders. So good, she did turn on the ball of this foot, but because she didn't give enough plie with the front leg before transferring her weight into this foot, she doesn't really get very far around before she has to get her weight back down on this foot because she never really got her weight in this foot. So her weight has always kind of stayed in this turn here, and so that means that at some point she has to wobble back here, which makes this really look kind of clunky. Again, very weak transition. She's just standing here in this non-shaped shape. She's slowly bringing her arms down but not in a controlled way. So again, transitions, dancing through those transitions. This is a transition moment where she's a little bit frozen in time here. It's not a super interesting moment. Again, look at there's no energy coming out of her legs hardly. She needs to get more in a plie. She needs to get more on the balls of her feet. She really needs to bring energy from the core outwards. She's really missing that which makes it uninteresting to watch. Great arc here with this arm coming out and around. She's only losing it here at the last second, but it was a good arc to come around here. Good job with this arm here. She brought it up in front of her body and then straightened the elbow and is doing a nice arc back. Again, not enough energy though. The arm here is in a shape, but it's sort of like resting on the joints rather than using the strength of her muscles to make a really clear, strong shape. There's not also very much energy in the legs. What I'm missing from her is energy coming from her core out all of her limbs and out her head. She's missing that, and so it doesn't look very performance ready.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

Here you're seeing the omelet being overcooked and the result being a rather tough end product. What should be done is the omelet should be gently cooked so that there is no browning at all using a much lower heat. The egg and onion mixture is being mixed with a spoon here. A better way to do this would be to use a fork or a balloon whisk. That would give you better mixing of the egg so that the white and the yolk are mixed together adequately. When making a classic omelet, generally two to three eggs are used rather than one individual egg. Here they are using only one egg for this omelet. Here the omelet has been flipped over and you notice that there is browning of the egg from the underside. Now first of all a classic omelet should never be flipped over. Second, the heat should be much lower so that you avoid any browning of the eggs. The egg was allowed to spread out into a very thin layer in the pan. The individual is then taking a metal spatula and going under the edges of the pan with the metal spatula. What should be done here is using a rubber spatula or a wooden spoon, the egg mixture should be gently stirred until the curds of the egg start to form. Once that occurs, you just gently cook the egg until it is finished cooking. Then you can fold or roll the omelette, adding any appropriate fillings at that time. The pan chosen here appears to be a crepe pan, which is a relatively flat, large diameter pan. A better choice here would be an omelet pan or a saute pan that was between 6 and 8 inches in diameter or 15 to 20 centimeters in diameter. The individual has also lit the flame under the pan and is about to add his oil. This is all while he still has to prep the ingredients for his omelet. It would be better to wait to heat the pan up until after everything is ready to be added to the pan. Here you hear a sizzling when the egg is added to the pan. This is an indication that the temperature of the pan is too hot for making an omelette properly. The pan should be heated on a low or low-medium heat so that when the egg is added you don't hear any sizzling. The raw onion is being added to the egg prior to cooking. What should be done is that onion should be sauteed separately, removed from the pan, and then the omelette made. After the omelette was finished, the sauteed onions could be put in to the inside of the omelette if it is folded over in half, or if it's made as a classic French omelette, it is rolled or folded into thirds, a slit being cut in the top, and the sauteed onions then being added into that slit. Now here the individual has actually added the oil to the pan. Now while oil is quite acceptable for making an omelette, the classic way to make an omelette is by utilizing clarified butter as your fat.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

When preparing a classic omelet, one would use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to stir this egg mixture immediately after adding to the pan to form curds of the eggs. Once those curds form, that's when you're going to let the omelet sit and slowly continue to cook. Here you can also notice a higher heat based on the visual of the red on the burner. And for a classic omelet, you want a low heat to prevent any browning on the underside of the omelet. Here the omelet has been folded almost in half and the preparer is continuing to press down on the omelet. Again, this omelet was cooked already once it was flipped over and now it's in the process of being overcooked. Here the preparer has flipped over the omelette. When making a classic omelette, the omelette itself is never flipped over. It is allowed to cook without flipping on low heat until the eggs are set and still are moist and shiny in appearance. Here the preparer has selected a small saucepan, approximately 6 to 8 inches in diameter, which is the perfect pan to make a classic French omelette in. The preparer is using his knife to move things around the onion, specifically on the board, by taking the knife blade and drawing it across the board. This technique will dull the blade of the knife and make it more difficult to cut. So if one needs to move ingredients on a cutting board or other surface, you can take that knife and turn it upside down so that you use the spine of the knife to go along the cutting board and that way you prevent your blade from getting dull. Here the preparer has whisked the eggs well. What you're trying to accomplish is a homogeneous mixture of the yolk and the white. What you don't want to see when you cook the omelette is streaks of egg white that have not been well incorporated into the yolk. The pan is placed on the burner. The burner has been turned on. It appears that the burner is relatively hot, as can be seen by the red glow coming on and off under the pan. Also, oil has been added to the pan, a small amount of oil. Now, cooking temperature for a classic omelette would be low to medium low. This way, it helps to prevent the browning of the eggs. The use of oil is acceptable. However, the classic fat used to make a French omelette is clarified butter, which is whole butter with the milk solids and water removed. For more information, visit www.FEMA.gov Here the preparer has added salt and some other seasonings to the egg mixture. Typical seasonings for a classic French omelet would be salt and pepper. However, based on individual taste preferences, other seasonings can certainly be added. The preparer is adding the chopped onion and green chili to the beaten egg. Typically, with a classic French omelet, one would saute any filling, such as these vegetables, prior to adding them to the finished omelet. So you can use the same saute pan that you would cook the omelet in, saute the vegetables, remove them from the pan, prepare the omelet and add the vegetables to the omelet before folding in half, or if the omelet is rolled, then you're going to cut a slit in the top of the omelet and place your sauteed vegetables in that slit. The preparer is continuing to press down on the omelette, flip it over, press down on the omelette, flip it over. This is not benefiting the final dish. Again, what this is doing is overcooking the omelette and creating a tough, rubbery egg dish. The person preparing the omelet has placed a sheet of clean paper towel on the counter. On top of that sheet, he has placed a bowl in which he is going to mix his eggs. This is actually a really good practice, so that when you break your egg into the bowl and when you're mixing, it doesn't get onto the counter. It's a way of catching any egg that might get out of the bowl. Here you see the preparer pressing down on the omelet after it was flipped. Once that omelet was flipped and the top side of that egg hit the hot pan, the egg was thoroughly cooked. And at that point, the egg should be removed from the saut\u00e9 pan. Further cooking is going to overcook the egg and create a tougher end product. The preparer has selected a fish spatula to use to loosen the egg around the edges of the omelette. This tool is quite acceptable and useful for this task. You could also use either a rubber spatula or a pancake turner. The preparer is now finally cutting a bit of a green chili to include with the chopped onions. The preparer has taken some sliced onion and he is chopping that onion utilizing a chef's knife. A chef's knife is the perfect choice for chopping or cutting the onion. The preparer has cracked one egg into the bowl and is using a fork to whisk the egg. Typically an omelet is made with two to three eggs so that you have some body to the omelet and it's not just flat like a pancake. The use of the fork is a good choice. You can also use a wire whisk or even chopsticks for this.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

Quickly the climber then brings the right foot to come into a high foot placement, this time as we can see the climber is bringing the heel into the wall and behind the lip of the hold, which is a jug. This type of foot placement is called a heel hook, where the climber can use it to pull himself, his center of gravity, close to his right foot being in place. Also heel hooks are known to be really strong as the climber could be more methodical and static on performing a few moves or one big powerful move. The climber making the left hand reach to the positive hold being a jug. This one is very promising so the climber is really insisting on wrapping the fingers behind the lip of the hold to sustain the move. To do this the climber was struggling on first making the hand placement where he wasn't able to wrap the fingers around the hold so it has engaged into a very tight pull into the wall and keeping the right knee out so that he can bring his center of gravity close to the wall as he is towing hard and extending the ankle in order to gain more height for the reach. As we can see, it made sense that the climber brought his left side towards the wall and kept the left leg extended as a flag. This was so the climber was able to balance over the move when committing to the next hold at reach. This one also being a jog with the entry over to the left side, so the climber was able to easily transfer the weight since his center of gravity is between the grips but mostly onto the right side of the left handhold. Thank you for watching! At this moment the climber has transferred over the right hand to the jug, both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching and the climber, once securing the grips, he then releases the left foot from its place to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. Now the left leg being extended, this is called flagging out and helps the climber to gain a stability and have balance over the move. At this moment, once the climber has released the right foot, he's lowering his center of gravity and dropping his weight over the grips as he's keeping the arms extended. This is because the climber will be performing a dynamic move. So, right before the climber commits to the dynamic move, he will use the right toe to be pressed against the wall so that he's able to drive more power on his stance when performing the next holder reach. We can see how the climber after applying pressure onto the right toe to the foot chip, he releases the left foot from its place and extends the leg. This is called flagging out and as soon as the climber brings the left leg to be folded behind the right leg, now this is called back flagging and it helps the climber to keep balance as well as bringing his center of gravity close to his main areas of support being the right hand and the right foot. Since the climber is also bringing the left foot over to the right side, it helps him to gain more support when sending the left hand out on the reach. Having the left leg extended also helps the climber to keep his left side close to the wall when performing the reach. As we can see the climber has engaged into a pull up and brings the left hand grip close to his waist So that he's able to bring his center of gravity close to the wall as he stands up on the feet to gain height Now we can see how the climber has sent the right hand over to the next hold this one being a jug With a thick lip so the climbers able to wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold The tap of the right foot against the wall while keeping the right leg extended. This is called flagging out and the tap helped the climber to drive his hips over to the left side when making the throw of the left hand over to the hole at reach. The left foot mostly helped for the climber to gain height as he has engaged as well on the pull to bring his center of gravity close to the wall. As we can see the climber is standing up over the left foot after sending the left hand over to the next hole at reach and It's relying now on transitioning his weight to the left foot being in place as he's releasing the right foot being at distance The climber was able to transfer over the hand to the next hold that reached coming into a match. In order to do this, the climber needed to keep his center of gravity close to the wall. We assume why the climber has done a knee drop of the right knee pointing down. This is forcing the right side of the hip to come towards the wall so he's able to keep the right side into the wall when performing the move. This can be very strenuous for the knee especially because the climber had pivoted over the toe on the foot hold to press down with the inner toe area towards the hold. Usually jugs can be held out any direction due to the thick lip and because the climber can wrap the hands around the lip of the hold. However, the climber is struggling to sustain the direction as ideally the hold would like to be held by keeping the center of gravity over to the right side due to the opening being on the left. But because it's a jug, the climber is able to pinch onto the hold to not lose the grip. The climber was able to bring the right hand over to match the jug and in order to do so the climber needed to drop the weight underneath the grips. This one moving slightly to the left, the reason why the climber has dropped the left foot, this one acting as a tail for the climber to keep balance on the move. As well as focusing and transitioning over to the right foot being in place. Now we can see how the climber had brought the knee to come inwards and it was so the climber is able to move the direction of the push from the toe to the hold. Over is slightly down and to the right so the climber was able to move the right hand over to the left side. It's important the climber always glances down at the feet when performing a foot switch or a new foot placement so this one the climber is thinking methodically ahead of Pressing onto that left foot He's bringing over to a high foot placement where he presses the toe against the hold. The toe will provide a lot of accurate pressure when having to stand up over the highest foot and places the left foot in a way where the climber can later on use it to He's a stance when performing the next move The climber was able to secure the fingertips over the lip of the hold and enough the climber gives it one extra pull by dragging the fingertips into the palm to replace the fingers inside of the lip of the hold now to secure the left-hand grip. The climber then was able to bring his center of gravity underneath his grips and releases the right foot to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. The climber right now making hand gestures is so that climber is able to visualize his hand placement before starting to climb. At this moment the climber had adjusted the grips so that he's able to secure the right hand placement as he will need to perform the move at reach of the left hand over to the next hold, this one being a jug, and has brought the left foot to come into place at a high foot stance. Since the climber will eventually be transitioning over to the left he needs to transfer his center of gravity to the left foot being in place. Due to the direction of the opening of the jug, the climber chooses to not perform the heel hook and this is because it would be difficult to keep the heel hook in place when performing the next move as the heel, in order to be pressed, would only be pulling over in one direction. So he has swapped to make a toe placement instead over the lip of the hold and this is important that the climber thinks ahead of time how he will be using the foot when performing the stance to the next hold at reach. The climber once adjusting the left hand grip he has dropped the left foot this one to be under him so that he continues to apply pressure to the right foot being in place and made a transition of the right hand over to match at the jug it's a jug because the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold and once securing the grips the climber can extend the arms. Keeping the arms extended is ideal when the climber is moving throughout the holes on the route because it's not engaging the arms and this is a moment where the climber can recover the arm muscles before committing to the next move. The climber right now is bringing the right foot to perform a foot switch and it's important that the climber always glances down when performing a new foot placement on this one foot switch where the right toe would be taking place where the left toe is. And how he's doing this is that he has been rotating the ankle over to the left side for his left foot to give space on the hold for the right toe to come into place once the climber gets to apply pressure of the right toe coming into place above the lip of the hold and the climber is able to release the left toe from its place. Once the climber is securing the right hand placement, he's able to transfer over the weight to the grip by leaning back and is able to now focus on the feet to release the right foot to bring it into a high foot placement where he's placing it over a foot chip. As we can see the climber is actually matching onto the last hold and the climber must demonstrate control and stability not only over matching the hold with both hands but also on his body position. As the drop of the knee can be a strenuous is because the climber is trying to bring his center of gravity close to the wall carrying his weight and once the climber is able to demonstrate a stability or sustaining the last grip then the climb is completed. The climbers is starting at a sit start and sit starts are known to add a difficulty of grade to the climb This is because the climber will have to transfer over the weight to the placements on this one The climbers is starting at a two hand hold start and as we can see there are very small jugs where the climbers able to place the fingertips behind the lip of the hold and In placing the feet onto the wall, which he has done below once he presses it. He will be able to raise his hips to come off the mat", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So he's got his right foot back on There's really waiting this right hand. So he needs to utilize a backflip technique or do something different In this position But that left foot keeps kind of picking off which is gonna cause this whole shit weight to shift back away from the wall He's got to kind of pull himself back in and fight that swing back And for this one, he could have kept his foot on back plague to get this next right hand hold But even when he does kind of decide to swap his feet, he could do a little bit more of a twist lock So he's kind of sidestepping with this right foot holding on with his with his right foot and Holding off his left hand and so he could kind of rotate and twist into this forearm and bicep and really flag this foot out And that should help do the trick And just stabilize him a little bit more and let him really pull into his into his arm and stabilize himself So once again he's kind of starting scrunched up, his arms are pretty bent so he's really pulling himself off the ground. He seems to be climbing more with his arms than his feet so he could kind of get his weight over this foothold a little better by shifting his weight and his knee further to the left. And then kind of as he attempts to kind of launch himself up with his arm, his left foot kind of kicks back. You can see it has like the kind of the same effect on his arm. His arm kind of yanks back too. And instead of kind of moving up the wall now, all of his weight is kind of pulling him back off the wall. And then he does do another foot swap. So if he had just done that backflip originally, he would just been ready to go, could just bounce his right foot back out to the right and generate it up for this next move. And he's really not balancing out with his other foot. It seems like he's really generating all the momentum with his upper body and not really driving through the feet. He does a good job keeping his feet on the wall, but doesn't really power through them.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And also make sure your first step isn't backwards. Right here, he's blocking his V, which is a no-no. So making sure the ball is not blocking his V to be able to see any oncoming defenders or traffic, or basically just staying focused on the target. Right here, the offhand is down at his chest. His shooting hand is almost at his waist. You want to make sure you keep that shooting hand up and allow that follow-through to help the ball drop. Right here you have his follow through overlapping with his offhand. So just want to make sure that it's targeting towards the rim and it's high enough to make sure it gets enough arc on the shot attempt. Picture perfect here. Straight up and down, good balance, flexion in his knees. He's elevated, also popping his wrist, guy hand is open. This will result in consistency and may jump shots. Right here, this is pretty good. The offhand is open, which is allowing the ball to come off the fingertips, or it's just the support. And also, the main two fingers here, the pointed finger and the middle finger, are directed towards the basket, preparing for the follow-through. After releasing the shot and landing, his first steps are backwards. So you want to make sure you land in the first direction of the basketball. And that's leaning forward versus left, right, or backwards.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here I'll repeat my previous comments about frame to make sure that those arms don't fall, that they're up and lifted. Same thing with this back arm should be holding the dancer in the pink's arm up in order to create the strong frame to be able to guide and push and pull throughout the choreography no matter who is the leader. Right now it's not clear who's the leader in this and by a strong frame you'll be able to tell who should be following the pushing and pulling and guiding throughout the arms. How you guide someone in partner dances through a strong frame and through the pushing and pulling again of those arms. I would encourage the dancers to think about their hips moving in a pendulum swing, and if you notice, they kind of slightly press their hips forward when they should be pressing their hips out, so they can create this more pendulum swing with their hips to be able to guide each other through the movement. I would encourage the dancers, especially in this kind of movement here, to really think about creating an S and thinking about overextending their torso and incorporating their arm in this kind of flowing noodle movement. I think about, I like to think about when you're at a car wash, kind of that floaty that goes up and down in front of a car wash, that kind of movement. and the pendulum swing of their hips. I think I got cut off in that last one. I would encourage the dancers before they begin dancing, one, to be in a slight plie in their legs. Also, to have a really strong frame, right? So, to support the dancer, you have to have a really strong frame and grip, as well as really placed, weighted arms to be able to keep this frame while moving. Again, I would encourage dancers not to look at the ground and also to think about the pendulum swing of their arms. And the pendulum swing of their arms. I would encourage dancers to not look down, but to look at each other or to look past the other dancer in order to not bump heads into each other for safety, but to also be able to guide their partner throughout their surroundings or be guided throughout their surroundings. There's music happening in the background, but their steps are not matching the music. So there's lack of musicality and rhythm that's super important to partner dance.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

At this moment the climber is keeping the right leg extended. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. Once the climber had positioned the left foot she's actually standing up over that foothold bringing the left knee inwards so that she's able to bring her left side of the body towards the wall to support with the hand coming up for the reach. Now as we can see the climber is placing the fingers above the flat surface of the hold and because the flat surface is slanted pointing down the climber is using the edge of the pyramid to fold the knuckles to close the grip as the climber has brought the hand to be open-handed onto the hold. Due to the climber placing an open grip hand placement the climber must create friction of the palm towards the pores of the hold and in order to drop the weight the climber needs to bring the wrist close to the hold to sustain the grip. The climbers is starting at a one hand hold start where she places both of the hands into the same hold. This is called matching and the climbers hold it's a jug as a climber sustaining to a large lip which she gets to place the fingertips over the rounded area lip of the hold and engages onto the thumb from underneath. This allows a climber to squeeze onto the grips when sustaining the grip. Now the climber is starting at a sit start and sit starts are known to add a grade of difficulty to the climb as a climber will need to transfer over the weight to her placements. Now the climber is glancing down at the feet to place the right foot into the foot hold and once the climber applies pressure onto the right foot and she is no longer sitting on to the mat then the climb will start. The climber's right hand, we can see how she's arching the fingers. This is to apply extra pressure at the fingertips to sustain a closed grip over the hold. In doing so, the climber is transferring over the weight at the grips and has lost pressure of the right foot being in place. Now because this was the only foot being in place and she's so close to the ground, then the climb will end. The climber, once securing the left-handed grip, she glances down at the feet to perform a foot switch. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet when performing a new foot placement or bringing a foot switch into place. This is because the climber will need to accurately transfer the weight to the new foot coming into place. Now the right toe is coming into place where the left toe was in order to release the left foot. The climber, once lifting the hips off the mat, she quickly performs a foot switch to bring the left toe to come into place at the foot chip to release the right foot from its place.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

On these open and crossing steps, he does travel, but he doesn't travel as far of a distance as he could. So he should extend his legs out from his hips and take larger steps. I feel like the dancer is on rhythm, but he's very very close to moving too fast Just a smidge just a hair It would be best if you took a breath and slowed down just slightly He is technically on the rhythm He's doing the steps on the proper counts, but it's very close to being off the counter too fast For instance the second step he does the step that's odd to the center He does do it on the second beat of the group of four But it's it barely is on that beat So it would be in his best interest just to take a breath and slow down ever so slightly With bending his knees though, he also should still be picking up his feet. They don't have much movement here. The dancer does a good job of traveling equidistantly front and back. He uses the dot that he's standing on top of right now as his center, and he does return to the center each time after going forward or backwards. So that's a good spatial usage there. This last turn that the dancer just completed, he doesn't use his spot on his eyes as well as he should. His eye spot can be sharper when he's spinning. This time he spanned counterclockwise across the room. He's using his eyes, but he's taking in too much of the room because he's spinning with his head too slowly. If he whips his head around quickly, then he wouldn't risk getting dizzy as easily. His eyes being forward would allow his body to end exactly where he needs to be. His head is also too far forward. His head should be more back on his spine, sitting on top of his spine. Right now his neck is poked too far forward and it's not aligned. These last moments that the dancer is doing here seems a bit casual and it doesn't seem like he has that much energy and as great of execution as he had in the beginning of the dance. It's important that he finishes a dance strongly and doesn't lose energy. I think he's anticipating them shutting off the music and the dance being done but he should be concluding with just as much energy and should not stop or lower the energy level until the dance is actually done even if it's almost done. The dancer is condensing his spine here when he steps with his right foot outward. We also see that his spine is not aligned. It's leaning forward. His spine should be upright and in a vertical line. He can make more room for himself and for the rest of his spine by pressing up his neck upward. The dancer can be engaging his shoulders and his hips more in this basic salsa step, especially because it doesn't move, it's in place, which is fine. He does that while the choreography is meant to be in place, but because it isn't traveling, he needs to be using or engaging other parts of his body more, especially his hips and his shoulders here. It's good that the dancer is bending his legs here. It makes him not stiff. It's important in salsa dance that our legs aren't always pinned straight, that they do become bent at times to allow for movement. So that's what he is doing here.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Again, this dancer has really beautiful flow of the arms and carriages of the arms I would encourage them to make sure that they're moving from their back all the way past their fingertips to have more power behind the movement The last thing I would say is I would encourage this dancer to make sure that they end with a period or a very simple ending phrase and not just walk out after they did all this great, amazing work. Same thing here. This is a really great example of when you're grounded having more ability to roll those hips. I've mentioned this in a couple other videos with this dancer. I would encourage them to really articulate their hips as well as have power behind their arms. Notice how in this moment how they had great articulation a couple of steps right before this and they were able to see a little bouncy shake as they call it in Caribbean dance. We were able to see more hip articulation and a bounce of their hips, which is really important in this basic salsa step. I would encourage the dancer not to throw away these last moments of hitting the arm forward, forward, and then up, and then up, making sure that they really flick that wrist forward. They have this really nice shoulder flow and articulation happening here. I would encourage them to keep that as well as having this energy out their fingertips. But what is missing is groundedness and a moving of the hip articulation, right? So if we had this full embodiment from head to toe and this multiple polyrhythms happening in the body, this would take up the proficiency and the mastery of the basic salsa.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So he's going to have to take the egg out and let it sit, and then probably reheat the egg once he's got the, once he's done saut\u00e9ing the garlic and tomatoes. Okay, I see he has some things, some garlic and what appears, I think, to be tomatoes on the cutting board. I don't see any eggs yet. I was hoping he'd have all the stuff organized. He should have allowed the skillet to get hot. You notice when he poured the egg mixture in there, you didn't hear that sizzle. Yeah, it's pretty decent finger position. Could be better.

And I think the thing is that he's kind of, as he rocks over onto the right, his knee is facing outwards.

So ideally, once the mixture came to a boil, the temperature would be lowered so so that you had just a gentle boil of the milk and water mixture. At this point, you would let that go on a low boil for approximately three to five minutes to extract out the maximum flavor of the tea. The preparer is using the back of the fork to press onto the tea bags. This is likely in an effort to extract tea flavor from the tea bags. However, the temperature of the milk has not come up to boiling at this point. So you're not going to get good extraction of the tea flavor no matter how much you press on the tea bags. Here the preparer is using the mug that they will be serving the chai in as a measure, and he has poured cold milk into the mug and in addition has added a little bit of water. This water and milk mixture is then being placed into a small saucepan to make the chai tea. The choice of saucepan is good. It's important to note that when making chai tea, it is personal preference as to water and milk balance. So some people prefer more water than milk, others prefer more milk than water. At this point, the milk and water mixture along with the teabags and sugar has just begun to boil. The preparer goes ahead and lifts the saucepan off the heat to prevent the mixture from boiling over in the pot. Sugar and two tea bags have been added to the milk and water mixture in the saucepan. However, the mixture has not come up to boiling at this point. The preparer has also chosen to use a fork to stir this mixture.

This one, however, the kick has made the climber fall back with the force and the momentum of motion of the climber standing up on the right foot. And potentially the climber was stepping up on the foot, but was stepping up not directly to stay close to the wall, but maybe slightly out of the wall. The reason why the climber wasn't able to perform a secured grip once going to the sloper above. Here this position that the climber is engaging on to is a flagging out position where the left leg has been dropped from the hold and the foot is just being pointed out. This is called flagging out and this can also help the climber to support with balance when needing to bring the core or center of gravity towards the wall. Now because the climber needs to release the lower hand he brings his right side towards the wall as the next hold on the reach will be going up right hand and so the climber in this instance try to stay steady while holding on to the grip hold above which is a pinch and as we can see the right foot he pivots over to send the right knee over to point inwards being pointed out left side. That's so that the climber is able to keep his right side as close as he can to the wall to help the reach. In this move, the climber has pushed down on the left foot and because the climber wasn't bringing the hips over the foot, it was harder for him to make, keeping the center of gravity close to the wall. So he does this move quickly where he quickly shifts the weight over to the highest foot. And while he was standing, he was falling slightly backwards, but moves the left hand quickly to come in to join the left hand to a match. Here we can see the climber making the reach up for the next hold. This is called a sloper, where it's a shaped hold, which is smooth over the face of it and still has support. So once the climber gets to place the hand open-handed, very similar to the way that the climber is holding onto the block, the climber must then create force to engage on the grip. In this case, the climber must place the hand, expand the fingers in order to create, generate friction in order to stand the hold. Here it was good that the climber did a kick with the left foot, the one that helps the climber keep balance and uses it as a tail. The kick helps the climber to release some pressure from the grip but sends the foot down to replace weight onto the grip, making it this strong to hold onto it this time once the foot is extended. The climber must do this intentionally as the moment the climber makes the kick it would produce the climber to release pressure from the handhold. Here the climbers is starting with a two hand hold start. So that means that each hand has its own hold and both of the holds are jugs, which are easy for the climber to hold on to as they have a deep end at the other side of the edge. This is when the climber then is able to wrap the fingers behind it and also use the thumb, whether it's on the top or onto the side as a pinch, as he would do that on the lower one. Now the climber will start, be able to start the climb until both of the feet are off the mat, which he then plays down below. The climber, while staying on the foot or feet down below, the climber must stand up and bring the hips close to the wall. This to bring his center of gravity of weight over the feet. Also for the climber to sustain the hold that is sideways down below for the hand, he must pull his body up and to the right side slightly when doing the pull, which is aided by the stance. Now that the climber has reached the top hold, this one being a block that is slightly pointing downwards, the climber has an open grip. Open grips are not holds that are stable to sustain a grip for a long time, so the climber must create friction by extending the hand open and placing it spread out and then must lean back on the hold to create friction from the fingers on that open palm. The weight on this while maintaining that hold is important as the climber must stay below it. Now it's important that the climber knows how to distribute the weight on this and also keep a tight grip while holding on to the hold above. Here the climber has reached out to the top hold and was balancing over the left foot. Now the climber needs to switch his feet down below and it's important that the climber keeps the arms extended so he has a better visual of what he is working with when doing the foot swap. Now the type of foot swap the climber is doing is a hop in hop out which the left foot will be released while the right toe comes to be in place on top of the foot chip below. The climber has brought the left foot into a match. This means that the hand and the foot is on the same hold. Now the climber is going to be pulling not only from the top hold, but needs to press down on the highest foot, this one being the one by the match. And transferring the weight of his body over to the highest foot means that the left foot will have to leave the wall. As the climber presses down on the foot above, being on the match, that also will help the climber to stay on the stance if he brings the hip towards the wall in order to free up also the left hand for the next move.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

As he catches the ball out of the net after he makes the layup, he allows the ball to drop down near his waist area. Ideally, we want to keep this ball up higher in our upper chest or neck area and not allowing the ball to drop down low to this level. After he makes the first layup, he catches the ball and he didn't use the proper footwork. As he's catching the ball, he wants, as we're going to the left side of the basket to do the Mike and drill where we jump off of two feet, as we're catching the ball, we want to take a step with our right foot first and then catch the ball and then we're swinging our left foot around for step two to put ourselves in the best possible position to jump off two feet and shoot the layup. As the ball was coming through the basket, he was taking small little steps in place in the same spot on the floor with his feet, not really moving his feet. When we're doing the Mike and drill, we want to have active feet with the correct footwork and we should be moving from one side of the basket to the other constantly with the correct footwork and covering this distance as we're moving back and forth as we're doing the Mike and drill. as he's going up to the right side of the basket for the right hand layup. He's using the correct footwork by making sure that first step is with his left foot and then he's gonna swing his right foot into position for step two for the layup. However, ideally we would like, as he's catching the ball out of the net, for him to take a bigger step this way with his left foot and then swing his right foot around into position. Looking at the placement of the ball on the backboard, you see he hits the top left corner of the backboard and he does a good job of making sure that he has a slight amount of side spin so when we hit this corner of the square on the backboard, it's spent nice and easily into the basket. He had to be careful not to put too much side spin on the ball because if there's too much side spin on the ball, it will hit, even if it hits the correct spot, which is this top left corner of the square. If we put too much side spin on the ball, it will end up going and hitting the right side of the rim and bouncing off and we miss the shot. But he did a good job of avoiding this by making sure that he put a slight amount of side spin on this layup attempt.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here they are, just a little twist of the knee and a right lock off here gets into this pipe hold here with the left hand. The climber spends a considerable amount of time trying to remember what's on for the boulder and this is a super common struggle on spray walls, just kind of trying to remember what's on and what's not versus in a more commercial setting or a more typical competition setting where you have more sparse boulders where essentially everything that is available to you is on. So the spray walls have their own sort of unique tax to them in constantly having to remember what's on and what's not. The climber then kind of deliberates a little bit as to what to do with the feet, but ultimately they end up backstepping what was the start hold and pretty easily getting into this right hand, which is very similar to the previous right hand. Kind of looks like an ear, sharper, rounded in-cut hold. And here they are switching their feet from right to left, and they'll go into a square position. From the match the climber is able to go left hand to the dihedral here to a hold and I don't speak Spanish but I can imagine the climber was saying I'm tired or I don't know where my feet are supposed to be or something like this but I can imagine that climber is very tired not necessarily because this boulder is very difficult for them but because they had to spend so much time figuring out what the tracking was and tracking is basically what's on for the feet. Nevertheless they will get their left hand in on this hold and then cross up and right and match the finish hold and definitely a good fight for this send. Here we have the climber one move in on this boulder, started match on this yellow hold. They opted to start with the left foot on the start hold where most climbers start back step with the right foot on. This shows that the climber is pretty physically strong because that allows the climber to just kind of utilize a left lock off and push really hard with the left foot instead of the I guess more technically sound method of the right foot back step and getting the hip closer into the wall. But I do like this method. And again, trying to find the feet here. The climber is able to come up and match this pipe hold. Their feet actually cut. So what I was talking about earlier with the tension on the start foot, that happened here, hips swung out, but luckily the climber was able to utilize the backswing to come back and tag this foot and regain the position of the move. Climber then just sucks the hips in to the wall a little bit, locks down the right arm, and is able to easily cross left hand over into this crimp here, all while maintaining really nice core tension on the start foot. So the start, the foot here, the left foot, is pulling this direction, keeping the hips in this orientation that the arrow's pointing at, and it's fighting this swing out. So there's ever a possibility of the foot popping and the climber swinging out, but because the tension is there, the climber doesn't. Climbers then able to work their left foot onto a closer foothold and squaring up and locking down the right arm. They're able to go up and left into this hold here and it does not appear that they get it very good right off the bat, but they show a lot of stamina and discipline as well and chill in there until their body sort of swings in the right position and they're able to readjust and get it really good rather than trying to readjust right off the bat or get more or less flustered by getting it poorly originally.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

In this case, the climber needed to lean back and really trust the hold that he had with the arms extended or have found a position where he would be comfortable a little bit before that to not tire up the grip. Whenever the climber was ready, he would make the move out of it, not bringing himself into a crunch or engaging the body until he was ready to move up to the next hold. Here we can see how the climber has secured the heel hook by letting go of the right hand. This is because the climber as he was on the heel he has rolled on the heel inwards in order to lock the heel and gain more surface while the top of the foot potentially touched the wall, touched the hold above. Now since the climber now has a secured heel hook he has sent the right hand up for a match to the hold above. The climber doesn't have a space necessarily to go directly to the right side of the hold due to the left hand being already in place so instead has find a spot to the left side of that block. Now since the left hand doesn't need to be moving from that for the next move the next hand needed to be freed up is going to be the left hand as it needs to make the move out to the left side on the next hold. Here the climber has performed a technical move on the left hand. This now being placed on the block above, the climber is placing pressure with an open grip and mostly relying on the fingers above and placing the palm towards the outside of the block. Since it's an open hand, it's important that the climber can generate friction at the hold above. Now it's technical the way that the climber moved up the wall. First starting where the left foot was placed, where it was onto a match, quickly to move into the second hold which was a match and as well as moving out left to the hold and then bumping from that hold that he didn't spend a lot of time up to the block where he is now. This, the climber moved that hand onto those series of positions with making sure he was having a controlled foot placement and body movement, meaning body movement of throwing the center of gravity of the climber and to move along the base of support. The base of support, this is the points of contact that the climber has on the wall in order to free up the hand for those series of moves. Here we can see the climber how quickly moved the right foot into a match and then the reason why the right foot went up first was because the left foot was the driving force of pressure to carry the climbers weight. So does this release the pressure of the left foot and then once the climber was able to bring the leg up for a match, in this instance there is the both feet and the hand on this hold, does it by bringing over the left foot to then take over position for the match. The climber can be crunched up down at the bottom for the lower area of the body and at this time it's actually standing comfortably holding on to the grips creating more pressure from the hands while creating the foot swap at the match. The climber unable to reach the hold out left. We can see how he went for the throw and needed to apply friction as a type of hold the climber is going for. It's a bowl that's a smooth and rounded from the front. So the climber needed to create friction and keep an open hand by spreading the fingers to make the placement and keep the elbow in and drop weight onto it. The climber wasn't able to do this as he was hesitating to make it there and potentially if the climber was to do this again, he needs to stay down low and create momentum on the move forward out of taking off the left hand and standing up low then tall to make the reach to apply the right pressure to the hold next. Here we can see how the climber was able to engage the heel due to letting go of the foot down below. This means that the climber finally has transferred over the weight to the highest foot. In this instance, the climber was able to sustain the grip above by creating the right pressure and must stay as static as he can. Reason why the climber, instead of moving to a different direction, tried to bring the right foot at a high placement, going with the heel to be placed first. Since the heel is matching with the hand at this time, there isn't enough space into the hold, so the climber will have to work on moving the right hand over left side to allow room for the heel to rock into the hold. It is necessary that the heel is placed well as it would need to stay behind the edge of the hold. Since the climber is placing the heel hook, it would help the climber also having a third hand as he will be able to pull it towards himself when making the stance. Here we can see the climber starting at a two hand hold start. This the climber does by sustaining the hold on the right side and by push by pulling towards the climber and at the same time keeping the elbow slightly to the right side being pointed out to create pressure on the right hand grip. Now for the left hand down below the climber as we can see is pulling also on a jug and a jug is the same for both hands both holds where the climber is able to slide the fingers behind it and pull comfortably into it. The only difference is the direction of both holds are being pulled differently. In this case the lower hold the climber needs to pull the hold towards him or away from the wall in order to resist the grip. Now once the climber has placed the grips above then needs to work on moving the feet onto the wall. Once the climber gets to place the feet on the foot on the wall or the feet on the wall and is off the mat then the climb will start. Here we can see the climber struggling to keep on the grip, meaning friction to hang on to the block tight, and does this by generating more force of weight transfer to the hold above by leaning on the hold. Now he's trying to pull himself on the opposite direction to create that friction and also is aided by the climber moving the knee inwards as he pivots over the toe that's been placed on the wall. Here, once the climber had put pressure on the left foot that was placed on the matchdown below, was able then to create, transfer the weight over to the left foot, and the right foot went out onto a flag. This only to be balanced as he was sustaining with the right hand to hold above. Since the climber now had two points of contact, they look solid, one being the left foot on a big hold being a sideways jug, and then the jug above with the right hand, the climber was able to controllably let go of the left hand to bring the left hand into a match to the hold above. Here the climber is looking down at the feet. In this instance the left foot was the one that was being placed and the right foot was just hanging so that the climber was able to apply all of the weight onto the highest foot being the left foot at that time. Now it's good that for the climber in order to glance over to the feet is keeping the arms straight. This will help the climber to pull in when necessary needs to go up for a move but it can stay on the wall by pulling on the grips only with arms extended. That also being with the arms extended allows the climber to pull back and look down to the feet still being on a comfortable position while holding on to the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So that Rotation is still continuing. So he is still using his upper body in a Much more Energy demanding way. So this does use up a lot of energy very quick, especially on his arms And so this is probably going to get him very tired very quickly. So this is another reason why I would encourage Utilizing his legs a little bit more in an external rotation. So then that way he can kind of conserve his energy on his upper body So here we can see the climber is getting himself ready to be able to bring his left hand up into this next handhold here. So in this position the climber is allowing himself to do a hand-foot match, in where his hand is originally hanging onto a handhold and now he's placing a foot on that same foothold. So this does use a little bit of flexibility to be able to accomplish this. So what the climber is able to do is make sure that his arms are nice and straightened out. What this does is it allows his body to hang underneath his hand, his right arm in particular, and then he's able to tuck his hip out and away from the wall, which gives him a little bit more room for his left leg to move in a comfortable position to get into this hand-foot position that he has. So this is a really good example of using flexibility or using your body in certain ways to kind of become a little bit more flexible. So here we can see the Clamor is attempting to reach with his right hand onto the same handhold here, but as a result we do see that his left arm is sliding off of this handhold here. One of the main reasons why that could be the case is because his right hand is causing his left hand to have a difficult time of hanging onto this handhold because it's kind of getting pressed out and away from the hold now. So that could be the main result as to why his hand came off of this handhold. But what the Clamor ended up trying to do is that when he was hanging on with his left hand, he did place a high right heel hook onto this foothold right here. He did a really good job of making sure that he can hang on into this position because what he ended up doing is he focused on transitioning a lot of his bodyweight over onto that right heel hook because we can see a lot of his body getting pulled over into the rightward direction and at the same time he allowed his left foot to get off of the foothold he's been on and turned it into a flagging foot. This helps to further increase the amount of bodyweight he's placing on his right heel hook to complete this movement. It just seems as if the only reason why he fell off was because his right hand essentially pushed his left hand off the handhold. So here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing his left hand over into this hold here. So in this position we can see that he's hanging on with the right hand here, as well as utilizing a left foot in this position. So what we can see in the first person image is that he is allowing his left knee to be turned over to the right ever so slightly. And by doing this it helps to create a little bit of tension throughout his body, so that ultimately he can kind of engage his right arm into a lock-off position. And by hanging out in this lock-off position it helps to engage his shoulder a little bit more, so it kind of becomes a pivot point so he can rotate around his body on there. So it does use up quite a bit of upper body energy in order to use this, in order to accomplish this move. So the only other way I would encourage the climber to kind of conserve his upper body energy is by allowing his arm to be a little bit more straight. And instead of internally rotating his left knee, I would encourage him to externally rotate his left knee, so that he's able to transfer his body weight over to the left in the direction of the hand movement that he's going for.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Again, here the aim of the left hand fingers was off when crossing and multiple keys were pressed at the same time instead of one, so an incorrect pitch was heard. Although the pianist played with an incorrect finger crossing pattern in the left hand, they did play with correct pitches for this A major scale. The pianist performed the first three sets of pitches in their scales in thirds pattern. Here there is a big pause and there seems to be uncertainty with the notes and or finger crossing pattern that should be coming up next. It would definitely help to review this scale hand separately to get more pitch accuracy and to improve the accuracy with the finger crossing pattern. The pianist performed the same portion of their scales in thirds pattern again and then they stopped. They did not seem to know how to continue on and did not perform the rest of their scale pattern. Here the pianist crossed and played their fourth pitch with their left hand thumb. Usually you would perform the G major scale with the pattern 5 4 3 2 1 cross 3 2 1 with the left hand fingers. Here another error in pitch was made. The pianist should be playing an F sharp and is playing an F natural, which is a half step too low. Again here the pianist crossed too soon with their left hand fingers. They stopped again here and seemed to be confused as to what to play next in this scale pattern. The pianist quickly slid their thumb from playing an E to the white key next to it to play the correct pitch, an F, and continued to finish the remaining pitches in the scale. They did perform their right hand part correctly and used the correct finger crossing pattern when playing the ascending portion of the scale using their right hand fingers. Because they crossed the left hand fingers too early, they ran out of fingers when playing their last two pitches in the scale. They had to reuse their thumb. They used the thumb to play their B and their C, or the final two pitches in the ascending portion of the scale. Here an incorrect pitch was played in the right hand part. The pianist played a C natural and then quickly slid their third finger to the black key next to it to correct this mistake and play a C sharp. The pianist performed their C major scale again, hands together. They played with the correct pitches, but the finger crossing pattern in both hands was incorrect. It would definitely help to review the pattern while reading the sheet music, practicing each hand's part separately multiple times at a slow tempo, then gradually working on playing hands together again while maintaining the accurate finger crossing pattern. Here, after crossing the left hand thumb played an E, when it should have landed on and played an F, which is a half step higher. The aim of the fingers is still an issue when crossing during this scale. After it being attempted multiple times in a row, there are still extra or incorrect pitches being played consistently. Here, multiple mistakes in pitch and mistakes in the finger crossing pattern were made. It would definitely help to review this scale, the G major scale, hands separately to review and practice the proper finger crossing pattern. The pianist did play with the correct pitches, but their finger crossing pattern was incorrect. The pianist attempted the same scale again just now. They had more accuracy with pitches, but their finger crossing pattern in the left hand is still incorrect. Again, here an extra incorrect pitch was played by the pinky due to improper finger aim. Again, here the pianist played their fourth pitch with the fourth finger in the right hand. Traditionally you would play this scale or the G major scale with the finger pattern 1 2 3 cross 1 2 3 4 5. At first left hand finger 3 played a C natural and then the pianist quickly moved their third finger to the black key next to this key to Raise the pitch a half a step and correct this mistake Again, here an incorrect pitch was played in both the left and right hand. They quickly moved their thumb one key to the left to correct this mistaken pitch. There was an incorrect pitch played in the right hand part for this scale and also multiple mistakes with the finger crossing pattern after that first mistake was made. It would definitely help to practice this scale hand separately multiple times slowly to work on crossing at the correct times and also playing with better pitch accuracy. Here you can see the aim of the left hand finger 3 was off, it was pressing in the middle of two way keys when incorrect pitch was heard. It would help to watch the fingers more when practicing and performing this scale, and make sure they are more curved and firmly pressed on one key at a time. Again, after crossing, the left hand thumb played an incorrect pitch. It played an E when it should have played an F, which is a half step higher. It would help to practice this scale hands separately multiple times at a slow tempo to review the pattern of pitches and the finger crossing pattern. Here the pianist is playing the fourth pitch in their C major scale using their fourth finger when they should have crossed and should be playing this pitch with their right hand thumb. Here you can see the pianist playing an incorrect note at first with their left hand finger 3 They are playing an F natural and should be playing an F sharp here The pianist reattempted this scale again, and you can see their left hand Thumbs aim was off. It should have landed on an A and instead landed on a G which is One key to the left or a whole step too low Again, here you can see the aim of the right hand pointer finger is off, it is pressing in between two white keys instead of just playing the one key for the one pitch that is needed here. Here the pianist performed the first three pitches in their C major scale. They used fingers 5 4 3 in their left hand and then were about to cross and use the thumb when they should continue using finger 2 and 1 in the thumb and then cross later. Here the aim of the left hand pointer finger was a bit off. It bumped into two keys so an incorrect pitch was heard. It would help to keep the pointer finger more rounded and firmly planted on the one key and one pitch that it should be playing here. There seemed to be some uncertainty with this pattern and they are attempting the beginning of their scales and thirds pattern again here. Here the pianist corrected their mistake and played the proper accidentals this time around. Again, here they crossed too early in the left hand. They crossed after playing their third pitch when they should have waited and crossed after playing their fifth pitch in this scale. The pianist is restarting their C major scale. Again, they crossed too early. With the left hand fingers, they crossed after the third pitch was played, when they should be crossing after the fifth pitch is played. They also made the same mistake that they have been making with their left hand finger crossing pattern. Here, the pianist played an incorrect starting note in the right hand thumb. The right hand thumb is playing a C when it should be playing a B, so it is a half step too high. You can see in the left hand, they are playing the correct pitch or note B. They quickly corrected their mistake with pitch and moved to the third finger, one key to the right to raise this pitch a half step and to correct this mistake. The pianist continued to restart this scale, but unfortunately did not improve their pitch accuracy. It would definitely help to review the key signature or accidentals to make sure that all the sharps that are needed are being included and it would definitely help to work on the scale hands separately first to get more pitch accuracy before attempting the scale hands together again. They should review the finger pattern for this scale and practice the left hand part alone for a while. They should be using the finger pattern 5 4 3 2 1 3 2 1 to play the ascending portion of their C major scale. Again, the pianist is playing their fourth pitch in this scale with their fourth finger when they should have crossed and should be using the thumb to play this particular pitch. Here they second-guessed their accidentals and played an incorrect pitch again. Here they crossed after playing their third pitch with the left hand after starting the scale. This is now the third time they are attempting it. The thumb is playing the fourth pitch in the scale when the left hand pointer finger should be playing this pitch. Here the pianist crossed too soon with their left hand. They played left hand fingers, five, four, three, and then crossed and used their thumb when they should have played their left hand fingers, five, four, three, two, one, and then cross, three, two, one.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

However, this is where the grounding is really starting to catch up to her, the lack of grounding. If she were to bend those knees and drop that pelvis back, she'd be able to engage her pelvis more deeply in this kind of undulation moment. However, she's not really engaging her pelvis at all as most of her motion is coming from that upper body. As the dancer performs the chaine turn moving through the space, she's able to do so with relative efficiency because she is engaging her head by spotting her head. However, she would benefit from a little bit more clarity in her arms and a little bit more effective spotting of the head so that she's able to move more quickly to keep up with the high demand or the fast demand of the tempo. She would also benefit from softening the knees a bit and dropping that pelvis down so that she's a little bit more grounded in this movement and has a greater range of motion in her pelvis and is able to move more quickly and efficiently. As the dancer performs a basic salsa step moving forwards and backwards in the space, she's able to engage her arms choreographically as well as her lower body, which demonstrates that she has an understanding of the movement vocabulary. However, this movement or this music is very upbeat. The tempo is very fast and it requires a lot of rhythmic embodiment at a quick speed here. And because she's moving without really bending her knees and without much dropping back of the pelvis, which would have helped ground her, she's not able to keep up with the tempo of the music. So she's getting thrown off from her rhythmic embodiment quite a bit. However, she's got strong and clear arms here while they need to move a little bit quicker to enhance her embodiment. It shows that she does have this understanding of the movement vocabulary. She would also benefit from an increased range of motion in her pelvis. As the dancer performs this small jump into this position where she's supposed to be crossing her left leg behind her right leg with her arms stretched upwards, she's got a lot of nice clarity in the shaping of the arm here. I cannot see the arm in front of her but this arm that's above her head has a lot of clarity. However, she needs to really bend into this right leg so that she can cross her left leg more deeply behind her, creating a more grounded and clear shape. As the dancer peels her shoulder from the front all the way to the back of her, engaging in this kind of sideways or like cross lateral body roll here, she would really benefit from bending the knees and dropping the pelvis back so that she's more grounded. However, the body roll gets cut short because it's not able to effectively flow through her upper body down through her pelvis and her legs, and it's getting really cut short at her pelvis because of this lack of grounding, which is overall throwing her off the rhythm and making the movement appear a bit stiff and awkward.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

From this view we can see the back of her hand. So this indicates that she did not snap her wrist, which means that the ball did not roll off her fingertips to create that good backspin on the ball. As we release the ball, we want to snap our wrist downward towards the basket. Have our fingers go towards the basket or downward in the direction of the basket. This will allow the ball to...this will create good backspin on the ball, which is necessary to be a good shooter. Here you can see after the ball has already left her hand, as the ball is no longer in her hand, it's already on the way to the basket. Now she begins to raise her arm up higher to get her elbow above the level of her eye. But because on the release of the ball, the elbow was below the level of her eyes, her lifting her arm up after the ball has already left her hand has no effect and it does not positively influence the ball since it has already left her hand. Looking at the placement of the shooter's feet, you can see that her right foot is slightly in front of her left foot. So this positioning will allow for her elbow to be in closer to her body and align with the front of the rim. But you can also see that her knee is over her toes as she's bending down to shoot. So this is a sign that her feet are a little too close together. So she will benefit from spreading her feet slightly apart so that when she bends down, her knee does not go over the front of her toes. Here you can see that the player she's attempting, she does a good job of holding her follow-through until the ball hits the rim. But if we actually take a look at the follow-through, of her follow-through, we can see that her right hand and her left hand are in the incorrect positions. We want to hold the follow-through with our left hand up high with the palm facing the direction of our shooting hand, which is the right hand. So from this view, the left hand should be up in this direction with the palm facing this way, which is towards the right shooting hand. So we have our left hand held up here, and then our right hand should be up here with our wrist snap and our fingers facing downward towards the direction of the basket. And that's how we want to hold the follow-through on our shot, and not in this position here where our right hand is straight up in the air and our left guy hand is down bar our waist in this position. On the release of the ball, if you take a look at the shooter's guy hand, you see that her left hand, she kind of makes a fist with her left hand and her palm is facing downward towards the ground. When we release the ball, we want our guy hand to be perfectly open with the palm facing this direction, which is the direction to the right, which is towards the right shooting hand. On the release of the ball, you can see that her elbow is here, which is below the level of her eyes. And then when we shoot the ball, and as we release the ball, we want our arm at this trajectory here, where the elbow is slightly above the level of her eyes. So because on the release of the ball, her elbow is below her eye level, this means that the shot will be flat. And we want to make sure that we have that good, nice arc on the ball when we shoot it. And in order to get that good arc, we have to make sure that on the release of the ball, our elbow is above the level of her eyes.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

What he had to do was kind of lunge to his right hand. And his whole body kind of stays out. You can see just how far his hips are now from the wall. And both feet are now matching on this hole. So everything's kind of just pushing him further back from the wall instead of being kind of controlled and in tension with hips close to the wall. So once again, starting in a pretty good position, arms are nice and straight and engaged, really loading up these feet. So yeah, really good way to start the climb. And here we can see he does end up falling and it's because he doesn't really like establish onto this heel hook so he sets the heel but then Nothing about his body position changes if he was grabbing something close by this would you know work and you have to move But getting this pinch is gonna require him moving a little bit So ideally what's gonna have to happen is he's gonna have to kind of walk on top of that heel and get his hips a Lot higher so that way he can be kind of pushing down You know pulling down through that heel and this left foot can kind of help and assist but smearing against the wall And by applying this kind of downward pressure it can move him up And to the right to kind of get over this heel hook and get moving up the wall That's that the guy's just seems he places the heel places the foot and then makes the move with his arm So he seems like he's climbing really Arm heavy and not really taking the weight to his feet And you can see he's kind of attempting to do this kind of like drop knee. So you can kind of see that curve there. And what that's kind of doing is it's kind of driving his hips further from the wall. You know, these are good holds. He's able to kind of overcome and overcompensate with his arms. But ideally to save some energy and just gain a better position, he could kind of do the opposite, turn this left knee out, drive his hips into the wall, and then move his whole body kind of up and over this hold. And then he'd be in kind of a perfect position to do a back leg. And grab this pinch right here. Now this next move he kind of does is he hand foot matches the left hand. We'll see he's going with his right foot. So ideally now this would mean that he's going to free up his left hand. But he can't do that because he's right hand, right foot. And this whole scrunched up you could just barn door right off. It's way too stretchy of a position. And with the barn door it's just not going to work. So here's where I would suggest going up, either foot swapping down here low, and then bringing the left foot up. Instead of doing this really high, what he's going to have to do is a really high hand foot match, or a foot swap on his hand. So he's kind of just adding to the tension, like the difficulty of one being like bunched up. But two is by making the foot swap happen on a foot match above his waist versus down here low on this bottom foot.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

As she crosses to the side, her body position changes slightly to the corner. She can definitely go a little bit more to the side, but instead of keeping her body all straightforward, she does a good job just giving a little more direction in her body. The dancer starts stepping in place. She picks her feet up slightly, but just enough because it helps that her knees are nicely bent and she has a good rotation in her back and her arms. Here when she's taking the toe tap stepping forward, she does a good job keeping the movement flowing throughout her hips as well as her arms and just keeping her movements in her feet very light.

The climber went up left hand into this hold and originally grabbed it as an undercling pinch here and then switched it to a wrap, which I think is pretty smart. So the climber is basically just clamping with the pinky through the middle finger and the meat of the palm that you can see here. So here you have the climber matched on this flat rail here and a high left foot down here, square into the wall, and looking left at this target hold pinch here. And after a bump up and right, the climber is able to get into the finish hold here. And after pretty easily getting into this left-hand jug, Climber's able to surf out right to a really nice jug pinch here. And I think that the hard part of this boulder is over at this point. And after getting this left hand, the climber was able to swim their right hand up to an equal hold to the left, just these small little pinch holds.

It does not appear that the water came to a full boil and this is indicated by the fact that when adding the water to the cup with a teabag you're not seeing a great deal of color forming from the tea leaves. With very hot or boiling water you would initially see a dark color forming from the tea. The person preparing the tea has chosen to use a tea bag. One could also use loose tea that could be placed in the mug or a teapot. So once you brew loose tea, you need to strain it to remove any of the loose tea leaves. So it's preferable to either steep the tea in the pot that's holding the water, or place your tea leaves in a teapot and pour the boiling water into the teapot for the tea to steep. The preparer has obtained a mug that will be used for the tea. She has put water, tap water, into the mug to ensure an adequate amount of water be heated for the tea. This water is being placed in a small metal cylindrical pot. The pot has no handles. It would be recommended that either a removable handle be used when handling the pot or using a pot that already has a handle built in. Here, the tea has been steeping for about 45 seconds before milk is being added to the mug with water and teabag in it. Tea should be steeped for three to five minutes to extract the maximum amount of flavor. By adding the milk in this early in the steeping process, what's happening is the temperature is being lowered because this milk is not heated or steamed. And therefore, the steeping process is slowing down or even not happening depending on the temperature of the combined liquid. So again, three to five minutes for steeping of the teabag. And then heated milk should be added, or steamed milk, so that the temperature of the tea itself is not reduced. The preparer has added a small piece of cinnamon stick to the pot of water that is heating up. So what's going to happen here is that the flavor of the cinnamon will be steeped out of the cinnamon stick and into the water, so that when the tea is made, it's going to have a slight cinnamon taste to it. This is strictly personal preference as to what spices should go into the tea.

I would encourage this dancer to take bigger steps and make sure that they're really grounding their body and grounding their weight. I would encourage the dancer to be more grounded, so we can see some of that hip articulation. Also to send that energy from radiating from the back all the way out through the fingertips.

Here we have the climber in the starting position, down pulling on this flat in-cut edge. It's very easily matchable and the right foot is the only given foothold. And they're currently in a back step here, which means that the right foot is to the left of the plane of the body, which puts the right hip more in line with the wall and allows for the climber to progress most likely to the right. And the climber crosses up and left into this hold here, matches the left foot, so taking the right foot off and putting the left foot where it was, and there is a higher right foot here, and they're trying to get their weight underneath this left hand here.

Once again, I can't focus on it enough but the speed of it really discounts the effectiveness of this drill. Right here he should be going a little bit faster, jumping off his left leg, power and go with his right arm. Right here is taking the proper footwork, but his statue is up kind of high. In order to be able to elevate, you want to get some flexion in your knees. Whereas right now he doesn't. Standing up too high and also just pretty much just going through the motions.

So we would see more of a left to right curve on the ball. However, when the ball hits the floor it takes the spin out and causes the ball to go straight. So again we just see a small bit of bend, lands and then straightens up from where it lands. But a decent kind of curling connection with the foot coming in around the left side of the ball to generate that spin. I've seen some accuracy in a lot of the past and even this one is accurate but just in terms of stance, the standing foot very far away from the connection. Accurate nonetheless, just wouldn't really advise this stance too often as you can see the player, even though it's a low power kick, we can see both arms are up to try and help stabilise the body because of the distance between the two feet and the fact that the player is leaning to the left to try and get that touch. Here just seeing a bit of an inaccurate pass possibly caused by the player electing not to use the left foot when the ball has been kind of coming towards their left side. So what they've done is they've stepped across to expose this right foot and in turn kind of drag a shot or a pass that was intended to go here or towards the post here and a little bounce back out again because of this momentum to the left. Just seeing quite an inaccurate pass here and the reason being we see foot, toes pointing down towards the floor, ankle kind of twisted out in front, knee out in front and just the leg just a little bit twisted with a kind of a dangling foot which just doesn't give super hard redirect and super hard contact and we just see that foot drop down, pass ends up kind of coming in here so not accurate to the target and reasons being yes we could see for this to be more accurate, more of a straight leg and a toe pointing upwards, go around kind of the top of the ball with our foot kind of coming into the ball like this, leg here giving that more upward spin and just guiding the ball into the target a little bit better. We're seeing a mixture here again, going out to kind of a one touch passing exercise. It's coming out, it's going back with one touch. We've seen kind of an inside touch from here with the right foot. And now we're seeing an interesting kind of a lace slash outside of the foot pass back in with the right foot here. So really just up in the variety in the touches here, in the touch type, in the pass type, showing an array of different things here. So it's hard to put a finger on what exactly the exercise is. Here we're seeing more of an inside trap with the right foot in this direction. What we see from this touch is also a plant. So this foot now in the air just after the touch. And it's going to step in, plant somewhere here after it is planted. Somewhere around here, the left foot is going to come around. Kind of rush in almost and play that pass in. So the player seems to be in a rush to get these touches off and moving. I'm not quite sure what the rush is or why they're rushing to do it. But this is what is happening so far. Still just seeing one touch pass in left foot, right foot, in and out. Quite decent accuracy, low power and definitely more of a passing exercise here despite the player standing in the goal. Again, just a series of one-touch passes over and back, inside of the foot. Great accuracy in the passes along with this kind of obstacle in the way the player is using the inside of the foot pretty well and not making the receiver run too far in one direction or another to get to it. So an efficient passing exercise at the moment for past a few touches. After quite a heavy touch towards this right hand side, we're seeing the player kind of rushing to the ball and still having to extend this leg out to get that connection with the ball. Looks like, without any context to what just happened before here in the build up, if this is a dead ball, this stance here could look like the player is going to put a lot of power in this kick. But they do a good job of getting there to make the touch, using more of a power stance and then actually controlling the weight of the pass to be weighted in here nice and lightly for this player to be able to control the ball comfortably. Again, some good accurate passing back and forth. A lot of these passes are accurately going to this player's feet so I must comment on that because I feel the players do a good job of consistently producing accurate passes. They're low inside of the foot, they're consistent in the stance. You're not super powerful but the distance isn't calling for much power. So yeah, I just wanted to comment on some of the positives we've seen in this video. Even though it's not dribbling or shooting, such good examples of 5 yard passing, passing stances, connection, and controlling the height of the ball. So in this video here, the name of the video is dribbling. The setup looks more like the setup we see for some of the penalty kicks. However, the player action seems to be a lot of passing to the feet of this player. Early on we see the ball being moved side to side and being passed in from different angles. So probably not going to commentate on this one as a shooting video, but maybe more just on some of the touches, the stancing, how the player is receiving the ball, how the player is returning the ball, and maybe some different types of technique they're using to pass the ball into this player's feet. Again, just approaching the 3-minute mark here and still seeing more or less the same kind of inside of the foot, one touch passing back and forth between these two players. Again, just much more of the same, not much variety from the past 45 to 60 seconds, just a lot of in, out, in, out, left foot, right foot. Accuracy wise, overall pretty consistently good. Again just a couple of outside passes and then inside passes we see now these this cone that they had kind of placed here, and they were working around has moved and it's just getting a little bit all over the place in terms of touch type and direction of these passes back in So in that sequence we see a mixture between outside of the right foot to the right to play a pass with the inside of the right foot and then we're seeing inside of the right foot to the left and a pass with the inside of the left foot. So a little bit of a mixture, we've got outside trap, inside play, then we've got inside trap, inside play. So here we're seeing the ball rolled out Focus player using the outside of the right foot to move the ball to the right To the right. So this is similar to what we see in the videos that are named outside trap inside pass You will see this player does follow this up and play it inside of the foot pass back towards this player here And we'll see going in the opposite direction it does eventually change But a good a good touch nice way moved over to a Good point to set up the pass so well controlled and moved to the right by this player", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The dancer executes nice precision and use of musicality. I would encourage them to have more attack in their movements to give them more of a performance quality.

He seems to be drizzling some oil over his cucumber and tomato mixture. That gives it a nice mouth feel. Also those two vegetables are very, they're full of water so they're going to release a lot of water. This gives it more of like a smoother feel and not something just wet. He's placing his tomatoes in the bowl. He's brought his cucumber to the plate and is cutting it into rounds crosswise. He's used the rounded side down to cut the tomato again, a half into another half. He would probably be better to move it to its flat side so that he had a better grip on it and would not need to worry about it sliding off the cutting board. He's retrieving his cutting board, which also has a cutting device attached to it. He's turned his cucumber slices perpendicular. He's transferring his cut tomato to his plate. He's having to tug at his tomato pieces to cut them. I think his device doesn't touch the cutting board fully at that angle and therefore it's making it difficult for him to cut all the way through or it's dull and therefore he's not getting a clean cut with every pass. He's adding a touch of a spice mixture, probably a masala by the color. It's a blend of spices typically proprietary to a given family or restaurant or just a blend of different spices, coriander, cumin, paprika, could be red pepper, could have a curry of some sort in it. It's just a traditional blend of spices that are familiar and comforting to that particular person. He's got a plate with a pepper and a cucumber on it. Now he's adding his cucumber, chopped, to the bowl. Now he's continuing to bring individual pieces of the cucumber in to make rough cuts. If he had more skill in the kitchen, he would probably have a better way of approaching this, cutting the length of the cucumber, making flat pieces, then turning the cucumber perpendicular to make a chop. Now he's making rough chops to individual pieces of tomato that he has on his board. Now he's stirring his mixture to combine all the elements, thoroughly coating his cucumber and tomato with the oil and spice mixture. He's cutting his tomato stem end off and now it seems he's cutting the tomato in half. He's added a tomato to the plate and taken the pepper away, placed it back into his bin.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

Again, not very clear whether this is improvised or structured improvisation. It just does matter because it helps one understand the way that the dancer is approaching the movement and how intentional it is or why it looks the way that it might be looking. In terms of being on count or rhythm or is the dancer thinking about the next step, if the dancer is moving along as they're designing it in the moment, it does have an impact on repetition, how it's executed, if it's executed more clearly after the first or second time that it's brought into the movement conversation that's happening in the moment. So those steps were pretty accurate, the swivel and then the step jumping out of that is a pretty common step. So that seemed quite accurate and the dancer was aware of where they were going in the space. So they brought themselves back before they executed the step that was going to travel them forward. So that was a smart way for them to move in the space. Dancer is doing a great job with saying the steps as they're doing them. Again, it's a little difficult to know if the dancer is walking through just saying, you know, step here, step here, step right, step together, or this is a step like, and here's this Charleston, and you know what the Charleston looks like, and the combination of steps that make up the Charleston. So again, it's hard to say whether this dancer is accurately executing the steps, but it is clear they are able to really call out what they're doing. So one can say that they're moving through that just fine and aware of where their body is going and what they're doing in the moment. So that I can say, but again, it's a little unclear where the dancer might be improvising or the dancer might be doing a combination of steps that they had already put together or something that is been socialized or popularized that we're trying to figure out if they're doing it accurately or not. So here the dancer has done a box step within a circle. So they announced that they're going to go and move in the circle and then they move to the left side as well. So it's interesting to see this step that is a box step. You're moving in a square, but she is taking this square movement into a pattern of a circle. So here the dancer was just reaching out to the front, alternating the sides with right and left, and then to the sides to right and left. And I would say that this is a bit stylized with the way that the dancer's arms are. Usually if you're reaching out, you want to extend the arm all the way, but it looks like she's keeping the arms bent here. They're keeping the arms bent here intentionally at this angle, having this soft sort of elbow with these hand gestures.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

We want the player to, one, jump off the ground with full maximum effort, allowing her momentum to carry her forward, to allow the ball to gain more power, arc, and accuracy to get above the rim and have the opportunity and needs of hitting our target area, dropping through the net. As a result of our players right-handed mic in layup attempt on the left frame, we can notice that the ball lands further from our target area, which is going to be the top right corner of the box on the backboard. However, it's parallel to our target area, still allowing the ball to create a proper angle with the right amount of force and power to softly drop inside the net, resulting in a completed layup attempt from the offensive player. Looking at the player's release on the left side of the frame, we can notice that an improvement the player can make to become more efficient in her layup attempts is to have her follow through and wrist snap towards the direction of the rim on her release to allow the ball to create the proper spin and rotation it needs to get above the rim and to hit around our target area.

This one is a flat surface at the top being a pyramid so the climber must create contact of the palm towards the hold in order to create friction to sustain the grip since this one will be placed as an open grip unless the climber gets to fold the knuckles in order to create pressure onto the grip. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet to make sure that she makes an accurate foot placement where she is placing the toe above the surface of the small foothold. Now as we can see the climber had intentionally made the position of the hand placements this one because she plans to keep the left hand on the initial hold to send the right hand over to the next hold at reach. Now the climb will start until the climber is no longer standing on the mat. Once the climber gets to apply pressure onto the toe she will be able to raise the hips off the mat. Unfortunately after the climber had brought the left leg to a flag the climber has slipped off from the hold that reach landing on the mat ending the climb. The climber keeps adjusting the left hand grip by placing the palm further into the wall. This so the climber can gain more surface of the palm towards the hold and manages to bring the right toe to perform a foot switch as the climber had glanced over at the feet and places the right toe over the hole to extend the left leg. This to allow the climber to lean over to the right side the way that the grip needs to be held. The climber is starting at a one hold start where she places both of the hands onto the same hold. This is called matching and as we can see the climber is sustaining onto the lip of the hold being a jug as the climber is able to place the fingers inside of the hold and to create more pressure to support the grips the climber places the thumbs from underneath to squeeze the hold. Now the climber is seated on the mat because this is starting at a sit start. Sit starts are known to add a grade of difficulty to the climb because the climber will have to bring the weight over to her placements and as we can see the climber has positioned the feet already onto the wall. Once the climber gets to press down onto the foot chips then she will be able to raise the hips once the climber is no longer sitting on the mat then the climb will start. Here we can see how the climber is forcing a twist of her body. This is because the climber must be laying over on the opposite direction of her hand placement. In this case because the climber is hooking the hold at the edge towards the surface of the hold, the climber must lay back over to the right side. The reason why the climber is twisting the body over to the right and support it for the climber and engaging this twist, the climber had brought the right toe to come into tap at the wall. As we can see, the climber has started the climb because he's no longer sitting on the mat and has kept the right leg to come out extended. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. Also, flagging out helps the climber to keep balance and stability over the move. The clumber chose to remove herself from the placements that she had positioned herself onto and instead dropped the placements to scoosh over closer to the wall and to reposition the hands. As we can see she is crossing the left hand over the right one and repositioning over the lip.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Notice how they're spotting to get around and they're able to glide smoothly in one singular piece. The dancer does a really great job at taking big steps. I would encourage them to kind of breathe and really relax their upper body to engage while they're engaging this really precision with their feet. I would encourage dancer to first plie and take a deep breath before starting this movement. So it doesn't feel as choppy. Notice how the dancer is also not only are they spotting, whipping their head around first, and then letting the rest of their body follow, but they're also using strength and power behind the arms in this circular motion to get around quickly. I would encourage the dancer to breathe throughout the entire dance, but especially in these moments, so then they can quickly go transition to the next step. I would also encourage the dancer to make sure that they, because they're hitting these staccato movements in their upper body and in their hands at this moment and in their feet to make sure that they also connect these two pieces throughout, through hip articulation. So using the hip to accentuate the movement as long with, excuse me, the toe tapping and hand tapping that's happening together would make it feel a little less awkward in this moment and more legato like it's flowing together. I would encourage the dancer to connect their head, neck, torso with their legs. In other words, we call this kind of flowing movement through the body an undulation. So as they step to the side, they should undulate and undulate. So right now what's happening is their shoulders are disconnected from their spine, which is not connecting to their feet. So it's creating this choppy flow of energy.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I think that they can really be more bended in the knee. There needs to be a little bit more connection with the top half of the body to the floor in the Charleston. They should be having a bended knee throughout this step. Keeping that basic rhythm, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, which allows them to again keep the rhythm together and to stay in unison. The dancers are doing a great job with the choreography and it's really cool to see the other dancer in the egocentric view, whether that's the lead dancer or the follower, it's nice to see that. Right there, the dancer just before the step missed the turn on that release. So just being aware of where the dancer is in the space when the lead dancer directs that following dancer. It's a little unclear if the following dancer let go or the lead dancer let go. They probably both let go at the same time, but just trying to stay in touch in that contact with the hands is desired, but they did a great job to keep going and to keep moving and to keep the rhythm. So that was a very nice indication that the dancers kind of know where they are with the rhythm, with the steps, and where they are in space. Lifting the feet, picking up the feet, stepping with the feet is good here. So in this moment here, the dancers are a little bit out of sync with their bodies and the direction that their upper bodies are going, even though they're kind of maintaining the footwork. Dancers are doing some great isolations with the movement. I would like to see them lifting their feet more rather than shuffling or sliding the feet. The dancers are doing a great job complementing each other, complementing each other with the movement and staying in sync with one another. The footwork is good. The dancers are using the hands, holding the hands and moving through the movement, exchanging hands, knowing when to let go, knowing when to take the hands. The dancer has a very nice turn. I would presume this is the lead dancer and they do a very nice, they do a very nice job of directing the follower.

And same thing though, she's got her left foot flagged out, now it's pressing into the wall and that's going to let her drive up and to the right. Again, we can see she makes the move and then she immediately gets opposite pose. So left hand on, right foot on. Flakes the other foot out. And that lets her bring her right hand all the way up and match it. Again, getting opposite pose, so she's got this left foot on, matched with the right hand, which she's matched, so she's probably reaching the right, left hand up. One more thing about this position is, right now she's kind of pushing her body to the right, so positionally what she can kind of do is shift her knee and her hips, so her knee is over this foot, toeing straight down through it, and that should lift her hips up and get her into a little bit better position. So here we can see how she starts, she's getting her arms nice and straight. Now she's looking down at the feet, she hasn't put her feet on, but she's really staking underneath the holds. So now she'll kind of walk her feet forward on the pads. They kind of bring her body under, so she kind of lets her kind of lean into the wall and really treat the client with her feet first. I can see she cuts her feet and while her feet aren't cut, you know, she's got this right hand higher so she immediately looks for her left foot. So that way she can stay opposite pose and gets pretty balanced. Instead of having the right foot on and having to get the left foot on as well, she just immediately instinctually gets the left foot on. So you can see she's kind of, she's on this hold match and it's at this angle. So she really wants to be down and right of the hold. And right now she's down and left. It's a pretty positive hold. You'll notice she's trying to kind of move her feet around so she can shift her body weight to be more in line with it. That way she can pivot and kind of stay straight underneath it. Right now with how her body is, she's going to have to pull herself up through it to move off of it. As you can see, she kind of starts to put both feet on, then ops against it. Sometimes having two feet on kind of pushes your hips up from the wall, unless you can really balance and keep tension between the two feet. Sometimes it is better to drop a foot. So in this case, it looks like she's getting ready to go up with the left hand, so she's getting opposite of the holds by having right hand on left foot. And she's got this other foot sticking out. That's not technically on anything, but it is smearing into the wall and putting pressure to the right, which is going to drive her body to the left. She's also kind of sucking her left hip into the wall, and so this should make reaching up with her left hand pretty easy when she makes this first move. She should be able to do it mostly with her lower body, and kind of just by pivoting around that right arm.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

It's good to remember that you always have more time than you think when transitioning from one note to another. This is a very good practice technique to isolate the hands, especially with piano, to understand the top line first with the right hand, and then the left hand with the bottom line. When playing this little run, the player is compressing the rhythms and also rushing through it. They should try to take their time and also just always practice slowly and understanding the movement from one note to the next between fingers. Left hand looks a little bit more blocked.

Looking at the player go into his left-handed mic and layup attempt, we can notice on the right frame the player does a good job of jumping and stepping off his right foot, which is going to allow him to carry his body's momentum towards the left side of the frame, making it a much easier finish for the offensive player. On the release attempt from the offensive player right-handed Mike in layup attempt, we can notice that the player does well at squaring his shoulders towards the back of the rim on his release, allowing the ball to be directed in a better angle, traveling towards our target area. Looking at the player go into his right-handed mankind layup attempt on the right frame. Again, we want the player to start his body placement position a little bit lower in an athletic stance to be able to have a more powerful and explosive jump on his layup attempts, releasing the ball quicker towards our target area with more force, arc, and accuracy, giving it a better opportunity of consistently going inside the rim. Looking on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player does well at getting his follow through going towards the direction of the rim on its release, allowing the ball to create the proper spin and rotation it needs to get around our target area, the top left corner of the box on the backboard, allowing the ball to develop a proper angle it needs to drop inside the rim. Looking at the release attempt of the offensive player on the right frame, a slight improvement we would want the player to make is to jump off the ground in his full maximum effort to allow the ball to gain momentum, arc, and accuracy to get quicker towards our target area, developing the proper angle it needs to drop inside the rim. This will also help the player in a game-like scenario release the ball quicker from opposing defenders trying to block or contest the offensive player's shot. Looking at the player go into his right-handed Mikeann layup attempt, we will want the player on the right frame to start out his body placement position lower in the athletic stance to allow him to create a quicker release going into his layup. Also, more balanced attempt as well as being more explosive on his jump guiding his body's momentum towards the right side of the rim. Looking at the player go into his left-handed Mike-in layup attempt on the left frame, we can notice that the player does really well at getting his follow through, going towards the direction of the rim after the release, allowing the ball to be guided properly with the right amount of rotation and arc to get towards our target area, the top left corner of the box on the backboard, allowing it to develop the proper angle it needs to drop inside the rim. The player does a really good job as we look on the right frame From him going into his right-handed mic and layup attempt by again using the correct foot Which is going to be his left leg to jump towards the right side of the rim Making it a much easier finish for the player Looking on the right frame, as our player is going into his left-handed mic and layup attempt, a few adjustments the player can make is to bring his ball placement position, again, above his shoulders, to create a quicker and closer gap to release the ball towards our target area, also creating more ball control and security going into the finish, as well as creating separation from opposing defenders in a game-like scenario, being able to strip, take, or steal the ball. As we look on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player did really well at guiding the ball towards our target area, which is going to be the top right corner of the box on the backboard. Also having his follow through go towards the direction of the target on its release, allowing the ball to create a proper spin and angle arc and accuracy it needs to get above the rim, hitting our target or around our target area, developing the proper angle it needs to drop inside the rim, resulting in a completed layup attempt. Looking at the player on the right side of the frame going into his right-handed mic and layup attempt, the player does really well using his left foot to jump towards the right side of the rim, allowing a much easier finish for the offensive player. The player also does well at getting his ball placement position above his shoulders to create more ball security and control on the finish, also creating separation from opposing defenders in the game-wide scenario, and as well as creating a closer gap to release the ball quicker towards our target area.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

It's a rolling ball coming towards the player, player setting up to pass the ball back one time with his right foot. So we want to get our body in a position where we can step into the pass, moving on the ball from a slight angle which the player is doing. Although when we're stepping towards here with the left foot we want to try and make sure that our left foot is in a position where our toe is pointing in the direction that we want to go, but allows the ball to travel alongside that non-kicking foot so we create this number 10 shape and on contact have that toe level with the front of the ball. So the timing again of the back lift and the awareness of the player to allow that ball to travel a little bit further is important to make contact alongside the standing foot. We can see again already the player leaning back and away from the ball so we want the player to have, as he makes contact with his left foot to the ground, plant it straight, slightly angled back position, left foot all the way to the left shoulder. You can see the left knee is already bent, player is leaning back so he's not in a fully controlled position to strike the ball at the correct moment. Again, players follow through action, foot varies his position so it doesn't look like the ankle is fully locked as he strikes through. We can see the immediate follow through action is to come across his body to his left, which is obviously partly to do with the preparation and his body facing one way and then him trying to redirect the ball the opposite. So we have not necessarily moved our left foot in line with the targeted action. We can see our body is also turning, our chest is facing to the right hand side as the ball is travelling middle and to the left. So we have not got our body aligned with the direction the pass wants to go. Again, the body leaning back and away, which means we don't have that full body momentum moving through the pass and moving forward in full balance. We can look at the follow through action, so player obviously angles his foot, follows through slightly towards the left side of the goal as we're looking at it. The non-kicking foot is still obviously pointing away, hips and chest are still pointing away from the direction of the ball, so the player is not maximising that follow through action and control. We want to try and get the follow through action with a straight leg, keep that foot in a locked position, not wobbling as he goes through, all the way through the line of the ball. We'll get the hips and the chest turning to face the direction of the ball he's going. We also want to try and get the body further forward, so bend this left knee forward as we're stepping in and making contact with the ball. Get the hips closer to the line of contact, get the chest leaning forward through the pass, the head in a steady and stable position over the ball on contact, so then in this motion where we're following through we can get our body moving in the same direction as the ball. So again the ball is being rolled towards the player so the timing and the coordination for the player receiving the ball to pass first time is important. Important he gets his body in a position where he can step into the ball rolling towards him from a slight angle. This just opens up his hips, opens up his ability to, especially using the inside of the foot, open up his knee and turn his body out to use the inside of the foot effectively. Again the non-kicking foot, we want to place the non-kicking foot in a position behind the ball as it's rolling so the ball continues to roll and we make contact with the ball when it reaches alongside the standing foot. So we want the toe pointing in the direction we want the ball to go and in a position we can allow the ball to come alongside the standing foot ready for contact. Once again we can see where the timing of the players actions is slightly too fast. We're hitting the ball in front of the non-kicking foot so we'll end up reaching for it. This one's not quite as far forward but again you can see position of the non-kicking foot is behind the line of the ball so we end up reaching for it, hitting the ball on the follow through action leading to the body leaning back and away from the direction of the ball. You can also see the toe is still angled to the side maybe slightly down which is leading us to hitting the ball closer to the ankle, the heel which is a heavier touch on the ball not quite as much control so the ball can vary off in a different direction than we're intending. So here again you can see the player hits the ball a little closer to a better position alongside the standing foot. But you can see the standing foot, the non-kicking foot is pointing to the left. The angle of the right foot is pointing back in this direction. So that's just going to affect his body position. You can see the lower leg of the right leg is leaning inside. That's going to affect the position that the foot can take. So locking the ankle when I try and make contact for the middle of the ball with the middle of the foot for the maximum control and power. So when we're hitting the ball slightly in front and we're changing the angle of the pass that's just going to affect our balance and control. Once again you can see the player leaning back and away as that back lift comes through to make contact with the ball. You can see the left knee bending forward, hips slightly further forward closer to the line of the ball. Chest leaning slightly forward, head in a steady and stable position focused on the contact points in the ball. Once again, player rolling the ball into the player, receiving the ball to pass the ball towards the goal. Angle of approach, so he kind of shuffles a little bit to the left so that will allow him to come at the ball from a slight angle, although still quite square behind the ball. We can see the player preparing to strike with the left foot as he steps his right foot forward first. We want to make sure that as we plant that foot to the ground, it's in a position where it's pointing in the direction that we want to go, which helps with our body position and our follow-through action. And then obviously allow that ball to travel into a position alongside the standing foot on contact. So we want to give enough room, which the player is doing well here, and get our body aligned to allow that ball to come into this position. Again, the follow-through action pretty limited from the player, keeps his leg in that bent position, foot wobbles slightly so we want to try and come through the ball, straight leg, ankle locked all the way through in the direction that the ball wants to travel to maximize the control and power. Again on that follow-through action, we want to bend that knee, bring the hips forward, the body forward so we're moving in the direction of the ball. Again, player receiving a rolling ball, important we're getting our body in line with the ball that we can step in and approach the ball from this slight angle so we can step into the pass, rotate our right leg through the ball. When we're stepping to receive a rolling ball, pass it first time, we obviously want to get our non-kicking foot in a position with our toe points in the direction we want the ball to go, give enough space that the ball can roll in so we have at least three quarters to a full ball width between the non-kicking foot and the ball so we can make contact with the ball when it rolls alongside the standing foot in this number 10 position and make sure we're keeping our eyes on the ball and stepping towards the ball to make clean contact. Again, just a follow-through action, so a slight follow-through towards the direction of the ball. You'll see the foot shakes a little bit, so it's not necessarily in a locked position as we strike through the ball, which is going to affect the consistency and quality of the pass. We can see the player follows through with a bent leg. Ideally, we would straighten the leg on the follow-through and come all the way through the line of the pass. We'd also like to see a bend in this left knee, bringing the hips and the chest forward in the direction the ball is going to go, not leaning back and away from the direction of the pass. Again, we can see on contact, the player is making contact with the ball in front of the standing foot. So this leads us to obviously making contact on an upward trajectory with the right foot. Ideally, I want that ball to be allowed to come alongside the standing foot so we can create better balance, better control. We can see our body position is leaning back and away from the standing foot. So now we're reaching forward for the ball. It's going to affect our contact point with the ball. It's going to affect our follow through, our control, our power. We can see the position of the foot also. We want the heel down, toe slightly up, ankle locked, firm contact, ideally through the middle of the ball for control, especially as the player is looking to kind of hit the ball on the ground. Hitting the ball straight through the middle of the ball is going to help with that control and accuracy. Here we're hitting what seems to be more of the lower half of the ball, which is going to impact the quality of control, the potential trajectory of the shot and everything that we can possibly do in the follow through action. We can also see the foot is angled as it's approaching the ball. So that's going to impact the contact point between the ball and the foot and the ultimate direction that the ball is going to go. and it's looking at the player's approach to the ball. So obviously the ball being rolled towards him. So the ball is rolling, moving. So we want to make sure that we're getting our body behind the line of the ball. First and foremost, try and put ourselves in a position where we can step and approach the ball from a slight angle. Coming at the ball straight will kind of make it more difficult to open up our hips, open up our body, give ourselves choices as to the surface that we're looking to make contact with the ball with. I want to make sure that when we're stepping forward, we're getting our toe pointed in a position directed towards where we want to go and in a position where we can allow the ball to travel alongside that foot and then strike the ball back into the area that we want to go. So it's important that we get that foot in the right position based on the direction the ball is travelling. So we can see on contact, if the ball is rolling towards us, we obviously want to step and still make contact when our non-kicking foot, the left foot, is alongside the ball with the toe level with the front of the ball and enough three-quarter distance between the ball and the non-kicking foot to be able to rotate right leg through the shot. You can see, obviously utilising the inside of the right foot, we want our toe to be in an upwards position, so heel down, toe up, so that locks our ankle, also allows us to strike true through the middle of the ball. Here you'll see we're hitting more kind of middle to the low half of the ball as we connect with the strike. And obviously down to the position of the non-kicking foot, really pointing out to the right-hand side, that's going to turn our body and affect the position of the right leg as it comes through and strikes the ball. So as we strike the ball with the inside of the foot, ideally we'd want our hips and our body facing towards the direction we want to go to help strike through the line of the pass. Once again we can see player making contact with the ball well in front of the standing foot so we end up now reaching for the ball out in front of our body also making contact with the ball on the way up and in the process of the follow through so our ability to generate additional power and control is limited. We can also see the foot position from the ankle to the toe, the toe is out so the ankle is not going to be in a fully locked position to make firm contact and we can also see the contact with the ball is much closer to the heel which is going to be a rounded and a more hard surface so we lose elements of control and power by not making contact with the inside curvature of the foot. We can see that obviously the non-kicking foot is pointing to the left and the angle of the foot is more pointing towards the centre and the right, the body position is leaning to the left so the contact point with the ball and the body position is not necessarily set up for success. And we can see the follow through action, player keeps his foot in a steady position but the toe again is pointing down so the ankle is not as locked and firm so the contact with the ball is not as strong. We can see that the follow through is more with a bent knee, we want to try and come through with a straight leg in that direction where the ball is going. But obviously based on the position of the body through the non-kicking foot which is pointing more to the right, the angle of the foot on contact wants the ball to come to the left. Our follow through now is coming across our body and affecting our balance and momentum and follow through action. We can also again see the players body leaning back and away from the direction of the pass. We want our hips, our body all moving towards and forwards with the line of the pass. And so the player preparing to strike the ball, pass the ball, so the ball's coming in, rolling towards the body. So we still want to make sure that we're getting our body behind the line of the ball, so as the ball's rolling in, still want to try and come at the ball at a slight angle to be able to open up our hips. Step forward into a position where we get our toe points in the general direction we want the ball to go. And in a position that we allow the ball to roll alongside the standing foot, create this number 10 shape, before we make contact with the ball. So where the non-kicking foot is positioned and the angle of approach for the player is important in this element. Again, once again, contact in front of the standing foot, even just slightly, that just means that the timing is slightly off for the player. We can see the angle of the foot and the position of the foot, the toe is pointing down and away from the ankle. So we're really going to be making contact with the lower part of the ball normally when the toe is pointing down and obviously the foot is angled for the ball to come back to the left side with the body facing to the right. So it's going to affect our follow-through action and our balance and control. Again, we can see the player leaning really far back from the position of the ball on contact so that follow-through action is going to be affected, which is going to then affect the control and power of the strike. So again we can see the player making contact with the ball in front of the standing foot which is going to have an impact in terms of the players balance and control over the shot. We can see the proximity between the non-kicking front of the ball and the angle approach being pretty straight behind the ball is now leading to the left leg bending in. Ideally I'd like to see with the inside of the foot from the near straight position down makes it easier to get the foot in the right position heel down toe up ankle locked to strike through the middle of the ball. Here you can see the toe is pointing down so we're now really making contact with the ball much closer to the heel and through the middle to top of the ball so it's going to have an impact on the quality and consistency of the contact and the pass. Once again we can see the player leaning back and away from the pass part of that is him reaching to make contact with the ball in front of the standing foot but also he's not preparing himself to step forward bend this right knee in get his hips forward his chest leaning slightly forward over the ball to get his body momentum moving in the same way that he wants to make the pass. Again, it's looking at the contact point. So again, contact's made with the ball still in front of our body, not allowing the ball to come forwards. Ends up that we'll reach for the ball slightly. We can see the angle of the foot is gonna redirect the ball coming away. Our non-kicking foot is still pointing to the right, so that's gonna affect our balance and our body control, our body momentum. Looks like our toe is still pointing down, so we wanna try and get our heel down, toe slightly up, lock our ankle, really strike through the middle of the ball. Here you see again, it'll be through the heel area of the foot with the side of the ball. And then we're still leaning back and away from the ball, partly because the ball obviously is in front of the standing foot as we're striking it. We wanna let that ball come a little bit further so we can get our hips and our chest moving in a forwards direction in the direction the ball is traveling. Here we can see the ball comes off, looks like closer to the heel so the ball comes off to the right hand side, the follow through coming to the left and the foot position changing quite quickly after contact. Again we want to try and follow through with a straight leg to maximise the power. Here we can see the non-kicking foot, the hips and the chest are more aligned in moving in the direction that the ball is going. We'd also like to see on this follow through the player bend this right knee, get his hips and his chest moving forwards and through the line of the pass to maximise the control accuracy, balance and power. Edrychwch ar y gweithgaredd ddysgu ar dros y ball ac fe wnawch fod y pheth yn debyg yn mynd yn leiaf, felly dydyn ni ddim yn edrych yn llwyr gan y cyfathrebu. Mae'n mynd i'w effeithio ar y cyfathrebu, ar y dyfodol a'r gwasanaeth ar y pas. Gallwn erioed weld y chwaraewr yn dod dros y gwasanaeth gyda'r ball pan mae'r gwasanaeth yn debyg, ond yna'n sicr yn llwyr ein llwybrau a'r llwybrau'n dod dros y gwasanaeth y pas. Gallwn erioed weld bod y pwyllgor yn dod yn \u00f4l a'n ffwrdd o'r dyfodol mae eisiau i'r pwyllgor mynd, felly er mwyn ei ddefnyddio'n effeithiol, mae'n mynd \u00e2'i gwadr dros y rhan o'r pas, yn erbyn ei hys, yn ymdrech ymdrech yna, gallwch weld ei chest yn dod i'r rhoi, mae'r pwyllgor yn dod yn \u00f4l, nid yw'n defnyddio'r gwasanaeth ar y ddewis a'i gydbwysledd i gynllunio'r gwasanaeth o'r pas. Again looking at contact making, contact with the ball in front of the standing foot. So obviously the player is going to be reaching for the ball so the leg is already on the upwards action of the follow through. We can see the distance between the ball and the non-kicking foot is maybe a little far away from where the player is intending. We can see the toe is pointing down so we're hitting the ball higher up on the ankle area by the heel. We can also see the angle of the foot is contrary to the body position. Non-kicking foot pointing more out to the right hand side with the hips and the body facing that way. And now we're angling our foot and looking to redirect the ball the opposite so there's going to be elements of our follow through and contact that's going to be disconnected. We can also see the body obviously is leaning back and away from the ball so as we're striking the ball forward we want to try and make sure that we're bending this left knee, getting our hips closer to the line of the ball, chest leaning slightly further forward, head in a position closer to the line of the ball, fixated on the part of the ball that we're going to make contact with. Again, we can see player making contact with the ball in front of the standing foot, which is going to naturally mean that when we are making contact, we are in front and reaching for the ball. When we reach for the ball, that leads to this body position of leaning back when ideally, if we're going to pass the ball in a forwards direction, we want our body to be facing and moving in that direction ideally. If we're reaching for the ball, we can see the foot doesn't seem to be in too bad of a position with the toe pointing out, ankle can generally be locked and striking through the middle of the ball. But we can see the position of the leg, it's leaning backwards, so we're making contact with the ball on the follow through, which is going to affect the cleanliness of the contact between the foot and the ball to strike through it cleanly. So we want to bend this left knee on contact, let the ball come alongside the standing foot so we can get the chest leaning forward, the head steady and still focused on the ball as we make contact and follow through. Again we can see in the follow through action, so his initial follow through does go through in the direction of the ball. You can see the foot position is not necessarily fully locked through, so in the few frames before you can see the foot wobble a little bit, so it means that we haven't locked our ankle and got real firm contact through the centre of the ball to control it. We can again see the non-kicking foot is still pointing out to the right as the ball is going the other way, so we're not using our body to its maximum effect. We want to make sure that as we're making contact with the ball that we're either adjusting our left foot to adjust to the ball coming in so we can get our toe pointed in that direction, which will help get our hips and our chest facing in the same direction as the ball and not have this follow through action come around and across our body, which is going to affect our balance and our full momentum coming through the line of the shot. Again we can see the player's body position leaning back and away from the direction the ball is going, so we're not maximising the power and control we can use by using our body to go through the ball. We see the follow-through action a little limited due to the balance of the player. We can see where the standing leg is in relation to the body. The body is leaning back and away from the direction of the pass, as well as where the standing leg is. So we want to make sure that we're moving forwards through the line of the pass. We can see the foot stays in a relatively locked position, but as we're making contact with the ball on the way up on the follow-through action, as well as the direction that the ball comes across. Obviously this left leg is now coming towards the right leg and across rather than all the way and straight through. So we want to maximise this follow-through action, keep our foot in a locked position, follow through with a straight leg to maximise control and power in the direction that we want the ball to go, keeping our hips, our chest and everything aligned to the direction of the pass. So in the follow through action you see the player turns his right leg out a little bit further after the contact. So the ball making contact inside to heel and he's opening up his foot to redirect the ball to the right hand side. So we can see the follow through action moving through the line of the ball. And I see the hips, the chest are facing in that direction which is good. The biggest problem I have here is the body continues to be leaning back and away from the ball so we're not really stepping forwards into the pass. We're really relying on the lower body and the right leg to strike through the ball, clean contact all the way through the ball. We want to get the hips forward, chest forward to make sure that our body momentum is moving through the pass. So we can see the direction of the pass, so coming slightly off the heel, redirects the ball more to the centre, so although the follow through is coming initially straight and the non-kicking foot obviously is pointing towards the right side of the goal, the direction of the pass is going to be impacted by the contact point with the ball. Again we can see the players balance is still leaning back and away from the direction of the pass, so it's important to let that ball come into an area, prepare ourselves so we can move forward with the direction of the pass stroke shot. So again, ball's rolling towards the player, so we're allowing the ball to come in. We still want to come at the ball from a slight angle as we step into the ball. We want to get our foot planted in a position that allows the ball to roll alongside it, get our toe pointing in the general direction we want the ball to go. But when we make contact, we want to let the ball roll into position alongside the standing foot. Again, preparation is key for any technical action. So a ball rolling towards the player, player is adjusting his body. So he's able to come at the ball at a slight angle, which is good, but we want to obviously step towards the path of the ball, get our non-kicking foot in a position slightly behind the ball, pointing the way that we want the ball to go and in a position where we allow the ball to roll into a position alongside the standing foot when we are due to make contact. So the timing of the back lift and the action to come forward to make contact, we should be making contact with the ball alongside the standing foot. So the position of the foot is okay. It'll just be more about the timing of the action that the player makes contact with the ball. So we're looking at the player's preparation. So the ball is actually coming towards the player, rolled from the player. So in terms of the preparation for the technique, slightly different. We're looking to get our body behind the line of the ball. So depending on where we're starting from, players moving to the left, getting his body behind the ball, so then he can step into the position of the ball and then obviously strike forward. Again, just looking at the preparation for the player, so the ball is being rolled towards him, so the ball is moving obviously towards the player. We want to be in a position where we step from a slight angle, which the player is doing. Step in a position where our toe is pointing in the direction we want the ball to go, and be in a position where we can let this ball roll alongside that standing foot and create this number 10 position. So it's important when we are bringing this back lift through that we're making contact with the ball alongside the standing foot. Again we can see the player making contact with the ball well in front of the standing leg so that's going to impact the technical action of the pass. We can see the player is already on the upwards trend of the follow through, heel is pointing up, toe down so that's going to affect where the ball makes contact with the foot. We're going to hit the lower part of the ball. We can also see the ball is hitting close to the heel and the foot is angled which is also going to affect the direction of the pass. So where the standing foot is placed is going to help with the body position and the follow through action. We can also see that as we're making contact, so as our follow through, our back lift is coming through to make contact with the ball, we want to bend this left knee forward so we can get our hips coming forward, our chest leaning slightly forward and our head in a steady stable position over the ball so as we're striking the ball in a forwards position our body is moving forward with it. Play again preparing to hit a rolling ball coming towards the body. So again get our body prepared moving behind the line of the ball but in a position where we can step towards the ball from a slight angle that the player is doing. Making sure when we're stepping forward to the ball our left foot is in a position where our toe effectively will point towards the direction that we want to go but allow about three quarter width or full balls width to allow the ball to travel alongside the standing foot so we can time the contact so we make contact with the ball when the ball is in that number 10 position with the non-kicking foot. So again you can see the players toe pointing to the right, ball is going to come in so if that's the case we're going to have to let the ball travel a little bit further to strike the ball moving to the right side of the goal. Again, player preparing to hit a rolling ball. So body position is important. Can we get our body in a position behind the ball so we can step into the ball on a slight angle? With that, the player is preparing to strike the ball with the right foot, so we want to step forward with the left. Can we get our foot in a position where our toe is pointing in the general direction we want the ball to go to help control our hips and our follow-through action? Can we be in a position where we allow that ball to roll alongside the standing foot to create this number 10 shape between the non-kicking foot and the ball, so when we make contact with the ball, the ball is in a good position where we can get our balance, control and accuracy. Just looking at the contact with the ball. So again, player looking to utilize the inside of the left foot. We can see here on contact, the player is making contact with the ball in front of the standing foot. Recommend the player allows the ball to travel a little bit further. So it makes contact in that number 10 shape between the non-kicking foot and the ball. We can see the player's foot is angled in. Part of this is coming from a straight direction in approaching the ball, makes it more difficult to step in and strike the ball with the inside of the foot traveling this way. So the angle of the foot and the contact position on the ball will affect the direction of the ultimate pass. You can also see as the player is approaching the ball, the body's leaning back. So we wanna make sure that we're stepping forward, kind of bending this right knee as the back lift comes through, making contact with the ball and the leg is in a straight position, getting the hips forward, chest slightly forward, head in a steady still position, focused on the contact point with the ball. Again, player striking a rolling ball coming towards him from the player on the outside. So we need to get our body behind the ball in a way that we can step into the ball from a slight angle. Step this non-kicking foot with our toe pointed in the general direction we want the ball to go, which will allow the ball to travel alongside that standing foot ready to make contact. As we are stepping towards a rolling ball, we don't want to be leaning back and away prior to really making contact. We want to try and make sure that we keep our balance. We can see the player's arms are already kind of tucked into his body and up so the player doesn't have maximum balance over his body as he's stepping into the strike. And then we see the initial follow-through action coming through the ball but across his body slightly. Again, the follow-through for me, we want to see a straight leg, locked ankle all the way through the line of the ball. Bend this left knee, bring the hips forward towards the point of contact, get that chest leaning slightly forward and our body momentum moving through with our hips and our chest aligned in the direction that we want to strike the ball. Player again preparing to strike a rolling ball, so the ball rolling towards him. He's looking to prepare to strike the ball with the right foot, so it's important that we get our body prepared behind the ball and ability to step into the ball from a slight angle to open up our hips. So we can see the player steps slightly with the left foot. We want the left foot to be planted in a position where it's pointing in a direction we want the ball to go. But allows the ball to travel into a position alongside that standing foot. Then get the timing between the back lift and the contact point on the ball, so he's hitting the ball at that point. You can see as the player is stepping towards the ball, the player's body is already leaning back and away. So ideally if we're stepping towards the ball, we're going to still try and get this straight position from the leg to the shoulder, get the hips further forward, the chest moving forward, so we're stepping in and meeting the ball rather than leaning back on preparation to strike the ball. We see the follow-through action for the player, so foot stays in a relatively same position, but obviously our toe is pointing down so it's not quite as firm a contact as we're locking our ankle, striking through the line of the ball, which is ideally what we would like to do. Obviously, the body position is set up to face outside the line of the goal, so we're coming across our body with the right foot, so our follow-through action is naturally going to come across and around if we're trying to get the ball moving straight when our body is positioned leading to the right. Obviously by stepping into the ball allows us to get our hips, our chest and our head slightly further forward, so as we're striking the ball we're getting our body moving in line with the pass structure. You can see again here, so a little bit based on the contact closer to the heel, the angle of the foot, the follow-through action, obviously all kind of facing in the same direction the ball is travelling. We can see the chest is leaning away, the hips are still turning a little bit towards the direction he wants the ball to go with the follow-through, but the body again leaning back and away from the direction he wants to go. We want to make sure that our preparation to the ball is key to set ourselves up for more success with the technical actions during contact and in the follow-through. Once again the timing for the player is there too soon, striking the ball well in front of the standing foot and no adjustment with the standing foot to see a change in direction so the non-kicking foot very planted to the ground pointing out towards the right, the right leg is coming through and around angled in a position, see here, which is going to probably redirect the ball more towards the left, toe is pointing in a downwards position so we are going to hit the ball either on the lower half of the ball or we can see the angle of the ball here is aiming towards hitting more of the heel part of the foot which is again a harder surface, harder to control the ball, hitting the ball on the upwards action of the follow through so we lose elements of power and control and the body again leaning back and away from the ball and the direction he intends to pass the ball. So we can see the player as he's preparing to pass the ball, we can see his initial step with his left foot. Obviously because the ball is rolling towards him, it's always going to be planted behind the line of the ball. So we allow the ball to roll alongside the standing foot. We still want to strike the ball and create this number 10 shape at the moment of contact. That's where we want to make contact with the ball. So to do that we need to still step forward, get our toe stepping so it's pointing in the direction that we want to go with the non-kicking foot. So that helps with our follow through and our body position as we strike and also help with the right leg and the position of the right foot and the right leg to make clean contact with the ball. Again, we can see player making contact with the ball in front of the standing leg. So in the distance between the ball and the non-kicking foot can also affect the quality of the technique. So we can see from the foot position, toes pointing down, we want the heel down, toe pointing slightly up. That allows us to lock our ankle, really straight through the middle of the ball. With the toe pointing down, we're going to hit the lower half of the ball, which is going to affect the quality and the control. We can also see the player is already kind of moving on to his follow-through action through the ball, which is going to reduce the impact of that follow-through in terms of the power and control we can generate. We can see the player's body again leaning backwards and away. So we want the ball to go forwards, but the body's leaning back. So that's going to lead to an impact on the quality of the contact between the right foot and the ball.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Again, keeping the knees bent and getting a nice spot so the turn around is really clean and smooth. So here when she walks side to side, using the space really well, as she gets to the side, she does a really clean pivot. So when she pivots, she is up on the balls of her feet. It just turns her body halfway to switch to the other side. So it's very clean and sharp, again, keeping the knees bent nicely, and then keeping a rotation in her arms and shoulders. So here from the kick with the right leg extending around, keeping her balance as she spins and stands in this position. The legs maybe could open out a little bit more, but she does have a good bend in the knees and a nice rotation and flow in her body and arms are extended over the head really nicely for this part. So here as she does a little square around and then jumps out to this position, she does so well with the nice bend in her right knee, with the right foot plant on the floor, extending this left leg out to the side so the toe is on the floor, and then extending the arms above and across her body, and then keeping good eye contact. So all over her body looks great in this position. So here the dancer starts stepping in place and then does a slight step out to the side. Here she's stepping out with her left leg and then sliding out her right leg. Her right heel is off the floor and she has a little, a small rotation in her arm. So keeping the energy pretty low for the beginning. So here another really nice simple movement as she taps her foot forward keeping the knees bent, tapping just the toe on the floor as she steps forward and then also with her arms they are coming out in front of her body as well as her chest is kind of bopping back and forth instead of the normal side to side. Here's where I felt like her arm could have really extended out more as she's stepping side to side. Really extend that arm out and keeping eye contact with the hand and following the hand as it moves around to the side. So here's the dancer steps forward and back. She does so correctly, again, keeping a nice rotation in her arms and circles and a nice bend in her feet, bend in her knees. She can definitely go up on the balls of her feet a bit more as she steps forward and back. And maybe remove her hips side to side more as she steps.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

As you can see, if I extend the bottom of the square out, the ball is slightly above the bottom portion of the square and it's slightly outside of the outside portion of the square. So since it hit there, we needed to put good side spin on the ball. But the side spin on the ball, because it's so low, it's not really going to make much of a difference because it's so low. So as the ball hits the backboard, it starts this downward descent and it's so close to the rim that it just hits the right side of the rim and we missed the shot. In order to make this shot, even if it's placed here, if it was just placed higher on the backboard, it would hit and the side spin he created on the shot would have been more effective and as it's falling down, it would have spent downward into the basket. Everything was correct about this shot, except for the placement of the ball on the backboard was too low. It needed to be a touch higher. He does a great job of catching the ball out of the net before the ball hits the ground. When we're doing the Mican drill, we never want to let the ball hit the ground because we're assuming that we're going to make the layup and then we have to be in position to catch the ball out of the basket and in the process take that step for the opposite side of the basket to make the layup. You can see here that he allowed the ball to drop down to his waist area after catching the ball and before going up into his next shot. Ideally, we want to keep the ball high in our upper chest neck area after we catch the ball. Catch it, keep the ball high, proceed with our steps, continue our steps to the opposite side of the floor, and then bring the ball from our upper chest neck area and then extend it out and make the layup. The player here demonstrates the proper footwork as he takes that first step with his left foot and then he's going to swing his right foot around into position to square himself up to the basket and then jump off of two feet to finish the ball nice and high. So in order to perform the two foot Mike and Jill correctly we have to make sure that we step with our inside foot. So when I'm going to the right side of the basket that first step is with the left foot. When we're going to the left side of the basket that first step is going to be with the right foot. Again, he catches the ball out of the net and he allows the ball to drop down to his waist level. We want to keep that ball high around the upper chest, neck area. You can see here the ball is nice and high in his left hand and his left hand is fully extended. The ball nice and high extended away from his body and allowing the ball to roll off his fingertips. He also does a really nice job of keeping his right hand up, his right arm up to protect the ball. By having that arm up it keeps the defense who would be on his left side, it keeps them away or at bay to hold them off so he can release the shot and the ball will leave his hands before the defense has the opportunity to contest or block the shot attempt. You see here as he's going to shoot the layup on the left side of the basket with his left hand, he takes that first step with his right foot. And then he's going to swing his left foot around into position so where he can shoot the ball nicely off of the backboard with his left hand.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So here in the roll, he does a good job from his neck down, but his head doesn't really do much movement forward and back. So I would suggest loosening up in his shoulders and his neck and his head so that way it moves along with the rest of his body. So here the dancer made a lot of noticeable mistakes. So just making sure to get the steps correct and then also just staying on top of the music, even if you do mess up. But the biggest note for this dancer is to really loosen up in the body. There should be more of a flow happening throughout the body. So just have to be a little less stiff and more flexible. So here the dancer is stepping forward and back. His feet are a bit flat on the floor, so he wants to make sure he stays up on the balls of his feet and keeps the knees bent as he steps forward and back. So here when he jumps back he needs to bend his knees a bit and step this right leg back a little bit so his weight is mostly on the right leg stepping back. Nice job with the arms stretching them out and around his body but then also again loosening up this upper body and bending the knees would help with that. So here's where he I think missed a step and a turn. So he kind of hesitated a little bit. And now he's kind of off the music going forward. So here when he steps to twist, he only twists from his knees and not his hips.

You can see here as he's cutting the cucumber he's having difficulty with the blade of the Anjale cutting all the way through the cucumber and he's having to kind of pull it from the blade. A better way to do this again would be to sharpen that blade on the Anjale or alternatively use a sharp chef's knife and cutting board. Here the individual is using an anjale to cut the tomatoes. While this is an appropriate tool to be used, in this case the blade is quite dull and the individual is having to actually pull the tomato away from the blade as the blade is not making a complete cut through the tomato. So a way to remedy this would be to sharpen that blade. Alternatively, a chef's knife and a cutting board could be used as well. Here oil is being added to the salad, which is appropriate. Here the individual has a piece of cucumber. It is the full round piece of the cucumber. And he is slicing rounds from this piece of cucumber. Now, it's always recommended that when you have anything round that can roll on the cutting board, that it be cut, in this case, lengthwise first, so that you have a flat surface that you can set down on the cutting board.

Aiming for the backboard would definitely give you a better chance versus aiming for the rim on a layup.

Right here her view is straight up and down, whereas if she could come over a little bit more and give her a better angle there, she probably would have a better chance at making it. But right now that angle is just straight on. And if she hadn't been taught the proper technique to hit the ball in the white box, regardless of her angle, it'll make it a tough lead off to make.

His follow through tends to have less power because of his upright balance. He's not striking through the ball hard. If he was, he would most likely have the momentum where he would then need to land on his striking foot. Because he's upright and not hitting through with as much power, his strikes are accurate, but tend to have follow throughs that are very short and sharp, or a little bit casual. Overall, he's been extremely consistent with his striking motion. Although he tends to be upright and not try to generate as much power as he wants on some of his strikes, he's very accurate with the use of his inside of his foot when he's generating his hips or putting his hips in the correct direction. With his technique, when he wants to hit into the right side, he tends to hit straight through the ball. And you'll see now he closes off this hip, which means he points his hip more towards this direction, which allows him to hit into the side and end of his goal. Again, the opposite is true when he's trying to hit across. He needs to open this hip up and face his hips more towards this direction. In terms of when he doesn't, the ball tends to go straight. Here again, he's done a good job of pointing his hips where he wants the ball to go. And you can see, despite his short run-up, because he's locked, he's able to get the accuracy and the direction he wants in the following shot. Here we can see that is extremely consistent which is a sign of a good striker in terms of being able to consistently recreate their setup. Although this distance is a little short, he still is lined up properly with the ball. If you want to drive with more power, take a little bit farther back stance in terms of your run up and also give yourself a little bit more room between your planted foot and the ball. However, for this in-step strike, it is perfectly adequate as long as you realize the power you can drive through will be limited. Now we'll take a look at how he's swinging through the ball and what he's doing in order to be as accurate as he is. Again, we see a relatively short run up. He's planted a little bit too close to the ball in order to generate more power, but his foot is in roughly the right position where his toe is even with the bottom to the middle of the ball. However, the distance between his foot and the ball is very, very narrow, which limits how much power he can drive through with. His relationship with his knee and hip are fine in terms of the bend, but he's a little in terms of being able to drive through and strike with more power. You can see here in terms of where his hips are pointed and how he's striking the ball is exactly where the ball tends to go. When his hips are pointed to the right, the ball goes there. Here his hips are pointed centrally, which means the ball goes right down the middle. Again, in terms of consistency, his hips and alignment mean that he's relatively accurate. While his strikes tend to not have a lot of power, they do have some because of his locked ankle position and his actual striking motion. Again, he's very consistent in the use of his hips and his inside of the foot to hit the ball in the direction he'd like to. One thing he's good at in terms of his accuracy is being consistent with his surface. He's consistently using the inside of his foot to strike the side or through the ball. When he wants to go across goal, in order to do so, he has to open up his foot. You'll notice in the previous two, or open up his hip, you'll notice in the previous two shots, he left his hip closed or more pointed towards this direction, which means when he wanted to strike across the goal, it was difficult for him. Here, he's opened up his hip a little bit more, which allows him to hit with his usual striking accuracy into the corner. We see again here he's consistently using the instep in proper form. His ankle is locked, his foot is turned all the way, and he's chosen to, in this case, to strike directly in front of the ball. In some strikes, you'll notice that he brushes up against the side of it, which will create a curve effect. When he's striking through, though, his ankle is locked, where despite his short run-up, because of his good technique in terms of a locked ankle and bent leg, he's able to get a decent amount of power, considering the distance. Here the player is working on striking the ball, which is the act of hitting it from where he's at, which is roughly 10 to 12 yards out towards the goal. He's primarily using the inside of his foot and repeating this action to improve his striking ability. Again, we can see here he has excellent balance, but he's not following through with overpower. You can tell he's not because he's able to maintain upright in a relatively straight position as he strikes. If he wanted to generate more power, he'd have to have more bend in his knee and follow through harder, which would move his body forward in a certain direction, most likely across or forward with his body, and he would end up landing on this foot. Because he's planting very casually or striking not as hard as he most likely can, he tends to stay very well balanced, although again, it makes his strikes accurate but limits the power he puts on them. Again, for his striking, it's very consistent. We can see his foot again is lined up with perhaps a little bit better distance between himself and the ball. However, again, because he's being very upright and his planted foot is so close to the ball, he can't drive through with power. However, what he has done very well is consistently use the same striking technique or strike surface, which is the inside of his foot. What he's consistently doing in terms of his strike is using the inside of his foot to brush along the outside of the ball, which he uses to direct or add a small curve to the ball. Again, we can see that he has a relatively quick walk up to the ball. However, again, his foot is in an okay position in relation to the ball, except for it is a little close. By giving himself some more distance, he can strike harder through the ball. However, it's adequate enough in terms of using the inside of his foot. His bend in his knee is okay, and same with the relationship with his hip. However, he's still very upright in terms of his striking motion. The first thing we'll look at is his pre-strike or his planting motion. Here we can see that he has a very quick step up, so he doesn't go that far back from the ball, which means he can't generate quite as much power. And he's a little bit too upright to strive through the ball all the way. His knee is bent as it should be, and the relationship with his hip is fine. He's planted relatively close to the ball, but still far enough back and with enough space to strike through with his end step.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It didn't really move much, but he took a small step with his left foot. And then he goes up and jumps off of two feet and shoots the layup with his left hand. When we catch the ball out of the net and we're going to the left side of the basket to shoot the layup with our left hand, as we're catching the ball out of the basket, we want to take our first step with our right foot here. And then we swing our left foot around into position for step two. So the right foot will come across here for step one, left foot here for step two. Now we have the best angle possible as we catch the ball out of the net and we can finish the layup nice off the top left corner of the square. But because he did not use the correct footwork, he's not getting to the correct positions on the floor in order to make the layups as easy as possible. And when we're doing a Mike and drill, you want to use the correct footwork to make the layup as easy as possible for the Mike and drill that you're doing. The player is doing the two foot miking drill. As you see, he takes a step with his right foot for the right hand layup on the right side of the basket. That's the incorrect footwork. The correct footwork is that we take this left foot and then we step here, step across our body and place our left foot on the ground here. Then we take our right foot and swing it around and square ourselves up here. So the left foot would be here in this position here. The right foot would be over in here in this area. And now we're releasing the ball from this angle for the layup. as he catches the ball out of the net he's doing a decent job of keeping the ball high as he catches the ball out of the net and then gathers himself for his next jump to shoot the ball on the opposite side of the basket. He's not allowing the ball to drop down to his waist area. Ideally we would like to keep it up a little bit higher in his upper chest neck area but so he just needs to keep the ball just a tad bit higher as he as he's going through this Mike and Drew after he makes the layup and catches the ball out of the net. You see he places the ball on the backboard outside of the square. And it's up near the top portion of the square. Slightly below the top portion of the square. So since it's outside of the square, you need to make sure that the ball has good side spin on the ball. So when it hits the backboard, it can spin directly into the basket. From the placement of the ball on the backboard, he did not get enough side spin on the ball. So it spin off the backboard, hit front of the rim, the right side of the rim. And we missed this layup attempt.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So just being able to go ahead and keep that dribble going to the rhythm, to the layup to eliminate having a violation, is definitely a best practice. Landing placement is good. He's in balance. He didn't take any extra additional steps. He didn't fall back. But he's in great position to maybe get the rebound and or get it out the net. This is actually gut mechanics on the layout. You see this follow through with his left hand. He's jumping off with his right foot. High possibility of making the layout. I do think he can be down a little bit lower right now, standing straight up. Won't allow him to be able to be as explosive and power up. Right now, as you can see, he only has a little bit of flexion on the layup. So just being lower, the ball traveling a little bit shorter, and being able to power up to how that security, if you come across any contact or any foul play. One thing, can't really tell here, but one thing I would highly suggest, keep your eyes up on the rim versus dribbling down or looking down while you're dribbling. Just make sure you keep your eyes on the target. Taking a wide base step out is creating a better angle. This is also something good, kind of initially starting low, but that first step is wide to generate that better angle to identify where the white box is at. So that's actually pretty good as well.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This is because the violist isn't using any of their wrist or flex in their fingers to do these quick string crossings. They're using all arm, even when it's a really fast string crossing like it is right here. And the arm is just going to be more aggressive and harder to finesse. Whereas if we used the wrist and the fingers just to make these small adjustments from one string to the next, we'd have a little bit more control and a little bit of a lighter touch and this would sound more pleasant, less scratchy. We heard that the last two notes here played at the tip of the bow were shorter and weaker than the notes preceding it. This is because the violist did not, as we can see, there's not a lot of pronation happening where the first finger needs to put weight into the stick by the pronation of the arm so that when you're at the tip you still have as much weight in the string as you do with the frog. So because they're not pronating in and keeping that weight in, these notes came out as lighter and shorter. On the accents being played, the accents that are popping out from this run of notes, there needs to be a little bit more weight in the string so that we don't hear as much twang and scratch like we just did, but we hear just a big explosion of pitch, if maybe a little bit of bite on the note. If you do an accent and do a fast bow speed without also digging in the string, you're just going to whiff the string and get extraneous noise, not pitch. In each of these small scalar passages, the violist needs to make sure that they are not playing the top note too short. That note should musically be a little bit emphasized, but at the very least, it should be as long as all the other notes. The violist needs to sustain these chords that she just played all the way to the tip. And then even after taking the bow off the string, keep the left hand down for a moment so that they really ring. What we heard was a really strong start and then a taper, but this is a large cadence and musically these need to be very regally presented and very almost organ-like in their sustained nature. We hear scratchy notes, fast notes being played on the high A string of the viola here. This is because there's not enough weight in the bow for this high string, especially at the location slightly closer to the fingerboard that she's playing it. Because there isn't enough weight, the bow is not properly making contact, and it's just scratching the surface of the string. The violists did a great job of executing this crescendo by moving the bow closer to the bridge. The violist is moving their bow a little bit too quick as they are crossing the strings in these slurs. They have to make sure that there's a slightly slower bow speed right at the change so that there is easier contact made with the string that they are changing to, crossing to. So the reason that we're hearing some of this scratching is because the bow is moving too fast and it's not able to properly catch the string that it is rotating to. There's a good sustain of tone and preservation of length of bow because the violist is playing close to the bridge with a slow bow, so that's the right thing to do. We need a little bit more bow on this open C string in this slurred figure so that it really resonates and we can hear the chord being built by this arpeggio. We're hearing the sound and the resonance kind of taper out here when that is not the musical intention. This is because the violist is not playing close enough to the bridge with a slow enough bow, so they're running out of bow because they're trying to conserve it as it's being expended too quickly close to the fingerboard. Because when you're closer to the fingerboard, there's not as much tension on the string and you have to use more bow. So if she moved closer to the bridge, there would be more tension on the string. She could save bow, use a slower bow, and get more tone. You'll notice he's doing a good job here of keeping the bow on an even plane so that both the higher and lower string of this double stop are heard equally. We need more length on the A string notes because they are sounding more shrill and quieter than the notes on the lower strings. We need more length on these lower notes so that they will speak as much as the higher notes. This is a great example of crescendoing on a down bow near the tip and pronating in to keep the weight increasing as they get to the tip. That's why they're able to get this good crescendo here. So it's exactly what we want to see. In these fast notes right here, in between the long notes, we need a slower bow speed and a little bit more pressure so that the notes aren't scratching but they're catching the string. The violist is rushing slightly right here. This note being played on the high string of the viola sounds too thin, slightly too scratchy. That's because the violist is using too quick of a bow and too close to the fingerboard. So ideally they would be playing closer to the bridge using less bow on the preceding lower strings and more bow on this high string high note. Through this passage where the bow stroke and rhythm stays exactly the same, but the violist is changing from low strings to high strings, they need to elongate the bow strokes on the higher strings and shorten them on the lower strings so that the lower strings aren't sounding louder and fuller than the higher strings like they are right here. The violist is rushing through this slurred passage. The violist needs to be more exacting with their string crossings in these slurs. We are hearing strings being played at the same time as they are rotating for this string crossing. Even though one would think it has to be a smooth rotation, it actually has to be multiple quick rotations right to the next string within one bow stroke so that we're only playing one string at a time and we don't hear these double stops happening because that's not what's written. We need a wider vibrato here. This vibrato is really only visible but not audible. So relax the left hand and allow for a wider oscillation of pitch. Through this last fast passage, we hear that the down bows were heavier than the up bows. This is because the violist was using too much first finger. You can see how the first finger is kind of hooked onto the bow right now. Too much first finger to initiate this fast bow stroke, and not enough arm, and not enough for the natural bounce of the bow. So if you rely on finer muscles before it's fast enough to rely on them, like in this case, you're going to get a more inconsistent sound. Whereas if you rely on larger muscles, like the wrist or even larger to the arm, you're going to get a more even bow stroke. We're hearing a lot of scratching in these fast bow strokes. That's because the violist is using slightly too fast of a bow and isn't allowing the hair to really catch the string on each note. So what we're hearing is the hair skating across the string instead of just pulling vibration out of the string. So a slower bow would fix this problem of scratchy fast notes. On the low note played on the G string in this repeating passage here, we need a little bit more length and a little bit less attack on the note. Right now we hear them pop out as a slightly more articulate and shorter note, and we need to hear them blend completely into this line. This is a great example of technical lack of ability getting in the way of a musical line. We have to always put the musical idea first and not let technique get in the way of that. In order to get the vibrato to sound natural and wide up in this register of the viola, the motion has to be moving the actual last knuckle of the third finger back and forth, not just shaking the rest of the hand. The violist here created this very narrow sounding vibrato by shaking her whole hand, but she did not actually allow that rocking of the hand to bend the knuckle back and forth on that third finger. So she needs to loosen up and she needs to make sure that the motion is moving strictly toward and away from the bridge so that she can get that wide oscillation of pitch in a loose natural sounding vibrato. As the violists moved to the tip in that long bow stroke that they just played, we lost volume and it naturally tapered out because they did not pronate enough and put weight into the first finger as they moved out to the tip. So then we just heard the natural decrescendo that a bow will do if you don't add in weight progressively toward the tip. So the correct thing to do is, as they're pulling out toward the tip, add in weight with the first finger so that the note remains a consistent volume. We're not quite able to hear the middle note of this arpeggio, and that's because the violist is rushing slightly, and they're not using quite enough bow on it. So they need to stay right in tempo, a little bit slower, and make sure that they're really pulling the bow through those string crossings and not waiting until they get to the highest note on the highest string of this slur to use a lot of bow. We notice that as the violist gets to the tip, their bow starts to be less straight. We can see that it's at a bit of an angle here where it should be instead perfectly perpendicular to the strings. This is because there isn't any bend in the wrist as they are moving outward on a down bow toward the tip. The correct thing to do would be to begin to bend the wrist and flex with the fingers so that your arm can move outwards but the bow can stay straight. Naturally, you have to push the bow further out from your arm and your hand as you move outwards because the bend in the arm will not move straight. It wants to rotate this way. We're hearing a bit of scratchiness and a bit of loss of clarity in this section that just happened. And this is because if we look at the left hand here, we can see that there's a lot of extra motion and extra tension in the hand. We can see that the first finger is completely extended, and then we can see that the second finger and the fourth finger are both raised up pretty high off of the strings. These are all indicators that the hand is tight and is clenching the neck. And then also, reaching these fingers out so far just creates more space, which then creates more time needed to come from that position back to the string to play the next notes. So ideally, we would want to see the fingers closer to the string, even when they're not playing. And we wouldn't want to see any of these fingers extended out, especially fully extended, with tension because this is just going to make it less accurate and less mobile around the viola. The instrument being played in this video is a viola, not a violin. This is too aggressive for Bach. What I mean by aggressive is too much bite on each note and a little bit too much length on each note in terms of how long they are speaking. So in order to get the forte volume without getting aggressive, the viola should be relying more on weight and less on pronation. We can see that she's very far out to the tip, even in this loud section. The further we are on the tip, we have to press, we have to pronate to get the weight in. And while it is possible to do this without accenting and choking the sound, it's much more difficult. It would be a lot easier if they attempted to stay in the middle of the bow, where they could get more accurate articulation just by using weight. And they would still have room on either side of the bow to move if there was an uneven bowing passage.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They're using too slow of a bow and likely too much pressure here, so it's not allowing the string to openly vibrate. So they should increase the bow speed a little bit, use a little bit more bow, so that we get more resonance and a more free-sounding tone on the viola. We should have heard more of a crescendo to this low note here. There's a slight crescendo, maybe to about a mezzo forte. I'd say maybe a 15% increase in volume to get to a forte by that low note played with the down bow. The violist is allowing their hand to cramp up to the fingers to get too close together. We can hear that because the note that they are playing with their third finger in the left hand is a little bit too flat. So if they had a more relaxed hand, they would be more able to get the correct spacing between the fingers and that would improve the intonation. We need more bow on the slurred notes on the higher string of this repeated passage, so that those notes will pop out more in relation to the repeated low string. This is a good example of controlling the bow. The violist is tasked with playing short and quiet notes, and because they have chosen to play out in the upper third of the bow, where that upper third meets the middle third, they're able to have a lot of control and they don't have to fight the bouncing tendencies of the bow at all. So this is good. We're hearing a not very clear changing of notes here, and we can see a lot of tension in the violist's left hand. That tension is visible by this fully extended pinky finger, as well as the thumb completely wrapping around the neck and the other fingers being raised. Because of this tension and this raising of the fingers, there's more ground to cover to get to the next note, which is making it a little less clear as they change notes in a slur. We're hearing a bit of stopping and starting in the sound, and that's because on this up-bow that the violist is playing, their placement is a little bit too low for them to smoothly move the bow at this speed. So they're encountering too much tension. So they need to move the bow a little bit closer to the fingerboard, probably about right here, so that they can easily get resonance out of both strings and that the bow can move unencumbered and create a smooth sound. We need to hear more of the high string in this string crossing bowed figure. The violist is using the same amount of bow on each string, but when they reach that high string, they need to increase the bow in order to match the natural resonance of the lower strings. The violist is doing a good job emphasizing the first notes of these slurred figures. That's the right musical thing to do. We need a little bit more of a bouncing sound coming from these repeated notes being played on the viola, a little bit more space and a little bit more body to the tone. Right now they're being played too far out in the bow and with too much pressure from the first finger, which is making them sound very stagnant and a little bit choked. This is just a note that the instrument the wearer is playing is a viola, not a violin. So I will be making comments on their viola playing. However, viola technique is very similar to violin technique and I will comment on aspects that are fundamental for all bowed string instruments. We need a little bit more of a wider vibrato right here for the violist. It's sounding a little bit narrow and we're not really getting an energizing of the pitch and really hearing an oscillation of this pitch. So just loosen up the hand and a little bit wider on the vibrato. The speed of the vibrato is okay. The violist is doing a great job of keeping the bow straight even when they're playing all the way at the tip. So that's good bow control there. These notes are sounding very stagnant that the violist is playing. They should add in a few quick wiggles of vibrato. So we get a few quick oscillations of pitch just to energize these notes so they don't sound stale. The violist needs to double check their intonation here. We need more length on the short note played with the third finger. Just because it is a fast note doesn't mean that we shouldn't give it enough length to really be heard. We can only sort of hear it.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So here they're doing a little what's called a dig toe. So they're digging their heel into the floor and then dropping their toe down on the floor as they step forward. So nice job there once they finally got together. And then coming back which they were doing the opposite doing a toe heel. So dropping the ball of their foot down and the heel down to the floor as they step back. So here's just a nice little rocking moment where they're just stepping side to side a little two-step and nice job they're kind of just staying in the same pace and still kind of flowing their body side to side as they step together. So here when they step back, I notice their legs are kind of hyper extended to be too straight. So definitely want to bend those knees just as you're swinging out. So it's not like his backside is pulling his body, not his whole body like pulling back, but it's just one part, so it just looks really off. So I want to make sure to keep those knees bent the entire time. So here this is a really good just open out so the dancer in the black he did a little spin and then opened out to the side. They were both able to keep the same rhythm so the one two rock step triple step so keeping that same rhythm as they spin out and do this movement so that is correct. So here when they are doing the rock step triple step facing each other, I think it would have looked better if the gentleman in the pink would have crossed back as well as the the guy in the black he's crossing back right now so I think they both should have crossed back just because look-wise it just looks off and like they're not doing the same step so both of them they should look like a mirror to each other and right now they do not. So here, I'm believing there should be doing a twist and this gentleman here is not. He's just kind of stepping more in place. So you want to keep the toes planted, well, keep the ball of the feet planted on the floor and then twist from your waist and hips side to side. But nice job keeping the knees nice and loose in this position as they move into this part. So here's a nice moment. They finally get back on the same rhythm and beat and with the same steps. They're kind of just doing a step ball change around in a circle while still staying connected. So nice job there. So just in this initial step that they're doing, I'm gonna go off the perspective of the dancer in the black since that's where the camera is. It looks like he is the follower because it looks like the guy in the pink is the leader. So definitely wanna make sure that they are stepping together and staying on the timing. Also, they can both be much lighter on their feet because I hear their feet like to the floor. And with swing, everything is much more lighter, like just really free, light as a feather in this style of dance and movement. I think here they definitely could have let go hands just to kind of change it up a little bit because it feels a little uncomfortable because they're not quite doing the same thing so I'm not really sure what the choreography is supposed to be doing. So here's where it gets a little complicated with the arms moving and then them kind of changing positions. This is where it's important to establish who is the leader and who's the follower, because the leader will guide that person in that position. So I can tell during this next sequence, they are kind of struggling to figure out who's leading or the follower isn't really allowing the leader to lead. So you really have to kind of submit yourself and just let them pull you the way you need to go and let your body naturally flow. So here, this dancer, he kind of lost the rock step triple step. So no matter what direction you're moving in, if you're swinging out, you still have to keep that same rhythm the whole time. So to be lighter, definitely dancing more on their toes and less with the flat foot. And also bending their knees a lot more just to stay nice and loose in their movement.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Player shifts the ball from his right foot towards his left. Right foot hits the ground, but then he doesn't move his feet, which is the first aspect of any dribbling motion, is moving our feet to move our body behind the ball. If we don't move our feet or move with the ball, then we end up being extended off balance. We see this straight leg position. That's gonna affect the quality of the touch, what part of the foot, what part of the ball. You can see here as he's reaching, it's gonna naturally mean that the toe points down towards the ground a little bit more, which is gonna affect the part of the ball that we can make impact with. And we can't get our knee then over the ball as we change direction. So our body is always gonna be extended and tall. We're not gonna be able to change direction with any balance or speed. So as these legs get further apart, obviously the body here is staying much higher. We can't bend our knees, can't get our hips low. And as we're making contact with the ball with the left foot to bring the ball back to the right, we can see that the body position is still very much facing towards the left-hand side away from where we wanna go. So the speed at which we can transition from moving from the left to the right is gonna be slowed down and impacted. Here's following up the previous action. So the player, as he shifts the ball from left to right, he actually starts to move his left foot towards, but then very quickly plants his foot to the ground and doesn't continue to move his body in behind the line of the ball. So now when we don't move our body and we don't move our feet, we end up now extending this right leg towards the ball. And then depending on where the outcome is, which is obviously here is to move the ball forward. And we're now gonna be off balance as we're making contact with the ball, and it's gonna affect our next action. We can also see how it affects the contact with the ball. So here the player is making contact closer to the heel of the inside of the foot. So that contact surface with the contact point of the ball is gonna affect the direction and the quality of the touch that the player has. And the heel is an outer rounded, harder surface. It's gonna make minimal contact with the ball than if he uses the inside curvature of his foot with the middle of the ball to really control the direction that he wants the ball to go. And we wanna try and angle the foot so that we are redirecting or controlling the ball into the direction that we wanna go next. And then just a quick point on the quick turn. So depending on what the outcome goal is, player stops the ball here with his right foot and pulls the ball back through the gap. So it's important when we're pulling the ball back that as we pull the ball back with this quick turn skill, that our body turns with it, especially if we're looking to go forwards. We wanna make sure that as we are now making contact with this right foot in the next few frames, that we are getting our hips and our chest facing in that direction. And by opening up our body can then really get our right foot into a position where we can push the ball forward and away. You can see as the player is pulling the ball back, he's getting back into a very upright position. So he hasn't stayed low through the turn. That should be an idea of the balance that the player has throughout the motion. So being in a very upright position is gonna make it difficult now for the player to push off and accelerate into the space. Again, the player utilising the sole of his foot to correct a previous action and to dribble. So the player is moving from his left to his right. Player again chooses to utilise his right foot, which looks like his more dominant foot. So he stops the ball with the right foot and then he rolls his foot from the middle of the ball over to the right. And then what you can see is as he rolls the foot over to the right, his right foot goes outside the line of the ball. The ball is rolling that way but his left leg, it's almost impossible for him to move his left leg with his right because his right leg needs to establish his balance because of the direction he's rolling over the ball before he can move his left foot in the direction he wants the ball to go. So in terms of the technique that the player has chose to use, it's the wrong foot with the wrong surface to provide the player with the ability to move freely with the ball. And then with that decision, we now get the extended leg stance, high hips, back up straight as we're trying to regain our balance but we've lost any element of speed and control through the dribbling sequence. Player is starting the change of direction with his right foot to go back the other way. Again I like that the player's body on contact with the ball is leaning to the left hand side which is where we're looking to take the ball. But you can see from this view although he's leaning to the left he's still leaning very much backwards and behind the line of the ball. If we're going to be looking to take the ball in this direction we want the body to be moving or preparing to move in that direction so we can generate the most amount of speed and control with the ball. So inside of the foot, middle of the ball, I want to get this right knee closer to being on top of the ball. This left leg is in an okay position if we're moving forward but by bending that knee we drop the hips, get our body turning and leaning in the direction we want to go rather than leaning back and away. It's going to impact our ability to move with the ball at speed. We see the player changing direction with the right foot. Normally we can see if the player is walking or in a running mode by the positioning of his legs as he's changing direction. So the foot's not in a bad position in terms of heel down, toe up. We can obviously look at the contact point between the ball and the foot. It's going to have an impact on the potential direction that we're travelling the ball to go. And obviously we want to try and make as much contact through the middle of the ball with the middle of the foot as possible to maximise the surface area we make contact with to maximise the control. In terms of the running action, I want to see the right knee over the ball as the player makes contact with the right foot and the left leg behind and bent. So then we drop these hips lower and we can push off the back leg. And that lower centre of gravity allows us to push off at more speed, have better balance, better ball protection. And it also helps us in terms of getting our body moving through the line of the ball. Here you can see as the player is looking to move the ball from right to left, the body is in a very upright position. So our body's not necessarily moving with the ball, we're going to be moving the ball first and then our body is going to move effectively second. So we want to make sure that our hips and our chest and our body is moving in the direction that we want the ball to go. Player dribbling with the inside of the right foot, so slightly better position here from the player we can see the body is moving more in tune with the ball in terms of the hip placement, the chest placement, the body is leaning in that direction although it is leaning back behind the line of the ball, we can see that from his arm position and from the eagle view where the player is leaning back. So ideally what we would like to see is as we are using the inside of the foot, the foot position maybe slightly higher with the toe through the middle of the ball to maximise the control but to get our body moving forwards and not just to the side I would like to see the right knee over the ball and obviously we would have this bend in the left knee that gets our hips lower, you can see the back of the body is very straight and a straight line so we have a high hip placement, our centre of gravity is higher so we lose elements of balance and speed and we are not really pushing off that back leg to change speed into the space. Once again, the player is setting himself up for an effective quick turn, although he doesn't finish off with that skill. So the ball is travelling through, you can see his feet are moving a little bit better with the ball. You can see that with his body position, with his standing leg as he stops the ball, so his body is not leaning all the way back and he's not reaching out for the ball with a straight leg. So his body is in a decent position. The issue here is the player is controlling the ball effectively with his heel, so that's going to make it more difficult, more rigid in terms of the ball. We want to use the ball of the feet to grip the ball and bring it back so we stay light on our feet and we have more agility and movement with the ball. Again, just commenting on the player's dribbling action, we're more kind of shifting the ball from foot to foot. We're not really moving with the ball. Player makes contact with the left foot across. His left foot is still in the same position as he made contact with. So in turn, when the ball comes to his right, we're now in line with the cone. So the outcome is obviously to dribble through the gaps into the space. So we want to see the player's ability to adapt and adjust based on his touches. But if you're not moving your feet with the ball, now we again, we end up with this position where we're now reaching out for the ball. We can see that's going to affect the player's ability to make contact with the ball in the direction he wants to go. Once again, we can see, although the player is making the touch with the inside of the foot, so we're moving in this way, the body position is starting to move to the left, where you can see that it's still very much leaning back and away from the ball. If we're using the inside of the foot with the middle of the ball, I'd like to see the right knee coming closer to on top of the ball, which is going to bring the hips forward, the chest forward and really show that the player is moving in unison with the direction of the ball. The players dribbling action, a little bit more of a shuffle we can see here. The players using the inside of his foot. We want to be moving in the direction that inside of the foot is going to go. We can see here the body, the toes, the hips, the chest, everything's facing forward. So now we're making contact with the side of the ball and the contact to go through this space is going to be impacted by the body position, by the footwork, by the control on the ball. We can see from the players body position again, very upright, relatively straight, relatively flat footed, planted to the ground, high body position, high hips. So the player is not really moving freely with the ball, which again affects his balance by not bending his knees, not getting lower to the ground. It affects his balance, affects his control, affects his change of speed and direction. Let me just look at the finishing action of the quick turn. So he pulls the ball back with the right foot across his body. He does get into a position where he's turning his body facing forwards, which is good, but you can see that he hasn't fully had control of the action because now we're making contact after the quick turn with a straight leg. So if we're in full control of our body and our footwork is moving correctly, balls of our feet, then we'll start to turn this left leg out, bend this knee, and then we'll open up our hips. So if we're gonna use the inside of our foot to push the ball forwards, we'd want our body more upright. So again, you can see he's leaning away and he's looking to go forward, whether that's to the left or straight forward. His body is still leaning backwards, even though it's moving to the left here in this view. The player's body is not moving in relation to the ball to match the desired outcome next. So we can see just the finishing action of the sole roll technique, he rolls the ball with his right foot across his body to his left, the right foot lands to the ground and he continues with that body momentum to move his left foot quickly. So where he makes control with the ball, you can now see his body is in line with the ball and he's not reaching out for the ball with a straight leg because he hasn't moved his feet like in some of the prior technical choices and dribbling actions that he wants. We could be a little further apart with our feet and get lower to the ground so we bend our knee. The knee you can see is in a better position in relation to the ball. The foot though is a little too far forward so it looks like we're going to make contact and control the ball closer to the heel which is a harder surface, a more rounded surface so the control and the touch to get the ball where he wants to go is going to be impacted. And again you can see the distance between the two feet on the finishing action is going to lead to the player being in a more upright position so our balance and our ability to now push off the non-dribbling foot, the right foot, is going to be more difficult to change speed and change direction. See the player utilizing a quick turns type skill, so this is different than some of the previous selections. He's using, he's not rolling his foot from the center to the right of the ball. He's now using the sole of his foot to pull the ball directly back, which is okay. Not ideal if we want to go in this direction, in this situation where the player's body is now facing away from where he wants to go. But it is a legitimate skill if he loses control to stop the ball and bring the ball back. So based on the previous time the player utilized this action, you'll see the foot, part of the foot making contact with the ball is now the heel, where we want the player to be making contact with the balls of the feet. That allows us to stay light on our feet, more agile, more balanced. If you put our heel of our foot on the ball, it's going to affect our balance and control. We can see the player's right leg which is dribbling the ball, he has that slight knee bend and there's a knee bend in that left, so his body is in a better position than the prior one. He's not leaning back quite as much to reach out for the ball, so we don't see that straight right leg as he's coming out for the ball. So he's going to be able to slow down, stop the ball, pull the ball back, has a little bit more control of his body. When looking at the skill, I'd like to see the body more in line on stopping the ball with the right foot more in line with the left leg and a bend in his left leg so he has that low central gravity, good balance, good control, ability to change direction and open up his body as he pulls the ball back. So the player utilising the inside of the right foot to change direction, come through the gap between the two cones. Again, the footwork here is a little bit better in terms of just being in behind the line of the ball with his body. So that's an important step. He's not reaching necessarily too far out of the line of his body. You can see a slight knee bend in this right leg. The problem we have here is all the other bodies leaning to the left. You can see from this view the body is still leaning backwards and away from the ball. So we want the ball to be travelling in this direction. So on contact with the ball with the inside of the right foot, we'd want our body moving in that direction, not moving backwards. And if we're moving backwards, as we make contact with the ball here with the right foot, we're going to now need to land on this right foot. So it's going to affect our transition to move with the ball on that contact. So although the body shape looks a little bit better here, the body needs to still be moving more freely with the direction of the ball. And you can see the players selection of technique using the sole of the foot with his body position not in the right place in regards to the outcome goal. He doesn't make the adjustments in terms of continuing with the same sequence. He wants to dribble through the area so as he uses the sole of the foot from the heel he rolls from the centre of the ball out to the right. As you can see as his foot ends up in a position in front of the direction that we want the ball to go. He's also then obviously having to maintain his balance. It's harder to move his body if you're rolling your foot from the middle to the outside of the ball. It's really difficult to maintain any form of balance and footwork because that's the right foot has to plant into the ground before you can move the left before you can go. Leads into this kind of position where your feet are apart so your ability then to push the ball away or change your body shape becomes more difficult. You can see the players body position again very upright, very high so we want to make sure that we're using the correct technique at the right time to help with other areas of the dribbling skill. Once again, just commenting on the players dribbling action, I wouldn't necessarily say it's a dribbling action as when we are making contact with the ball from right to left, the right foot stays very planted to the ground as the ball moves. So if we're not moving our feet and we're not moving with the ball, then we're effectively just relying now on the contact point between the ball and the surface of the foot and kind of shifting the ball through the cone. So by planting this foot and not moving our feet with the ball, we're not able to move our body with the ball, we're not able to lower our hips, get our centre of gravity lower, improve our balance, improve our control, improve our speed in terms of change of direction. So as the feet get wider apart, then we end up with these extended leg positions to control the ball. So now as I control the ball with the inside of the left foot, a lot of my body momentum is going to be planted through the left. So as the ball is travelling to the right, my body is still travelling in the prior direction. So in terms of our ability to change direction effectively, dribble the ball at speed, it's going to be much limited. So we want to make sure we move our feet with the ball, bend our knees, get our hips lower to the ground, get our body turning on contact. You can see here the hips and the chest are still facing to the left. As we make contact with the ball, we'll start to turn our body out to the right. So we're going to have the player correcting a previous action, so the ball's rolling away from him. You can see, again, the importance of footwork. So if we're reaching out for the ball, so the part of the foot to grip the ball is okay, ball of the foot with the middle of the top of the ball. But we're reaching out for the ball with a straight leg. So our ability to pull the ball back where the player wants to go, change direction at speed with control, turn his body position, is going to be very restricted with a straight leg. So we want to continue to move this left leg towards the ball, stop the ball so there's a slight bend in this right knee, get our left knee closer to the ball and bend, low hip placement so we have a better position of balance and control of our body. So then we can manipulate the ball, pull the ball back and change direction. Here you can see as the ball is moving to the left, the body is very much leaning back and away from the ball, so the player's ability to change direction and speed is going to be limited. So here just comparing the technical choice that the players made in some previous actions. Again because his dominant foot is his right. So he was using the sole of the foot but now he's using the sole roll technique to move the ball from the right to the left. Comparing to some of the prior ones, the comparison would be that he would use the sole of his left foot to roll the ball in the same direction he's doing. By using the right foot from this direction as he rolls the ball from the right side to the left, it's more natural for his right foot now to plant behind the line of the ball, get his body leaning in that direction. But as his right foot plants here because of his body momentum coming this way, it's much easier for the players left foot to move quickly out and keep his body in line with the ball for his next action either forwards or obviously through this gap. So this is the correct technical choice based on the position of the ball, where the player wants to go and the surface of the foot the player is using. You can see the player again we want to try and use the ball of the foot as much as we can. So the players foot is maybe a little too much contact through the middle of the foot with the ball. It's just going to slow us down a little bit but in general you can see the players body position is in a better place. His knee is generally closer to the ball, there's a knee bend in his left leg, his hips are a little bit lower than some of the prior actions and his body is leaning already slightly forward and to the left which is the direction that we want the ball to go. Player dribbling with the right foot. So we'll just look at the footwork to begin with. We always want to be working on the balls of our feet, moving in line with the ball and with the ball. So here you can see the left foot is kind of out away from the right foot. So we're reaching for the ball a little bit with this straight right leg. That's going to impact our balance, our control, our speed of change of direction. We want to be not planted into the ground, but working on the balls of our feet and moving with the ball. So if we're moving with the ball, ideally we would see the player with a slight bend in this right knee and the bend in the left knee with a low hip placement and the body turning and leaning in a direction that we want the ball to go, not this upright position and outreach leg to maintain control of the ball as we change direction. The player changing direction here with his left foot, left foot to right. Again we can see the player's body position and footwork. Feet relatively flat, planted to the ground. Looking at the leg position of the dribbling leg, very straight, which leads to obviously this very upright position, so and upright back position so we're not effectively moving with the ball. The body is starting to lean to the right. Again from this view we can see the player's body position to the ball is still very much behind the line of the ball. Ideally if we're going to use the inside of the left foot, I'd like to see the knee slightly further forward, close to the top of the ball, hips further forward and chest closer to the line of the ball so we can move effectively with the line of the ball. So we want to make sure that we're benefiting ourselves and bending our knees, getting our hips nice and low to help with our change of direction and fluency. He is looking at the players decision on the surface of the foot that he is choosing to dribble with or stop the ball, change direction with. So he is looking to move the ball to his right side, the left as we look at it. He's choosing, he's lost a little bit of control of the ball from the previous action. He's now stopping the ball with the sole of the right foot and now he's rolling his right foot from the middle of the ball to the right. So if we're going to use the sole of our foot to bring the ball back this way, we'd want to utilize the left foot and roll the ball from the left side of the ball to the middle. So and then the ball travels and then we would plant our foot to the left side of the ball. So the foot is not in the way of the ball and we can then move our feet behind the line of the ball and attack. If we're rolling the ball here with the right foot from the middle to the outside of the right of the ball, the foot is naturally going to plant in front of the ball or to the side of the ball and then it's going to be more difficult for the player to move quickly behind the line of the ball and then attack the space going forwards or to even change direction to the right. So here's just the wrong surface, wrong foot, not the wrong surface necessarily but the wrong surface with that foot and potentially the wrong foot. So as we're moving the ball to the right, again we can see the body position is still looking the opposite way. So we need to make the correct decision at the right time to effectively dribble and change direction. So actually the player doesn't use the quick turn action that he was set up for but decides to use that starting point and then again roll his foot from the centre to the right. So you can see when he does that before he can move his feet with the ball he has to plant his right foot in the direction that the ball is going to go, out from his body to maintain his balance and now as the players body position is set up you can see now feet further apart so he can't get his hips low, can't bend his knees, can't get his body turned so we lose that ability to change direction and change speed with the next action. Again, it's looking at the prior action and how it affects the next. So the player makes contact with the right foot in and around the same area it's currently in. The ball is traveling from right to left, but the right foot doesn't move. So the player's feet are not moving, his body's not moving. So now with the outcome being that we want to move the ball back this way, we can see as the player is now making contact and controlling the ball with the left foot, that the body is still very much pointing in the previous direction. So now the time and the number of touches potentially it's going to take for us to turn the ball and get back this way is going to take more time. So in terms of a game situation, the defender can close us down. It's going to be more difficult for the player to change direction at speed and with good balance and control. So we want the feet to be moving with the ball. We see the feet are getting further apart as the ball is traveling. That's going to lead to a much more extended leg position. So it's going to be harder to push off, change speed, control, protect the ball. Very upright back. So the body is high. So again, I love central gravity is much higher. That loses balance and loses the ability to push off the leg to accelerate with speed. So we're going to play a selection again as the player is dribbling through. Player is utilizing his more dominant foot which is his right based on what I see. So instead of using his left foot or the outside of his right foot based on his footwork, the player is again utilizing the sole of his right foot to roll the ball from the middle to the outside in the direction that he wants to go. The problem here is obviously as the player is rolling his foot over the ball he's now planting the foot effectively on the same side of the direction the ball wants to go and now he's going to have to re-establish his balance with his right foot before he can now move his left and now change direction and go either forward or away into this space in a game situation. So the selection that the player is making based on the position and the situation is the incorrect technique and then obviously we don't have our body in a position where we can really move with the ball. So as the ball is traveling away from the player you can see the body is set up still traveling in that same direction. So as the player is looking to bring the ball back across he needs to move his feet and get his body better situated so he can correctly use the right surface of the foot to change direction in that position. So again, just a consequence of the following action. So the player's previous action makes contact with the ball with the right foot here, as the ball travels to the left. And you can see as the ball is moving, it doesn't move this right foot, only is a left foot. So now we end up in a position where we are now reaching for the ball. So as our feet are now going further apart and not moving with the ball, we end up losing elements of balance and the opportunity to change direction at speed. Because obviously you see the body is in a very upright position, legs far apart. So now as we control the ball with the left foot, a lot of our body momentum is now gonna be going through this left leg. And it's gonna take time to now bring this right leg back around. So our change of direction and speed is gonna be impacted. Ian Player is starting to utilise this skill a little bit more towards the end of the sequence so he doesn't move his feet necessarily with the ball to keep the in and out pattern going so now he's looking to utilise the sole of his foot to stop the ball before he changes direction through here so correct surface of the foot, ball of the foot with the middle of the ball so foot's in a decent position. You see the right knee has a right, the knee bend, the left knee could probably be bent a little bit more to bring these hips lower and bring the body slightly further forward but the body's in a better balanced position where the player can turn and move with it based on his action. Maybe we want to be less planted to the ground with the left foot here, we see a very flat root to the ground so we want to always be on the balls of our feet so as we pull the ball in the direction that we want to go we're not rooted to the ground and we have good balance and control throughout the action. He's following on from the previous comments as the player reaches out with the right foot to move the ball from right to left. We can see the player plants his right foot to the ground. He's now not moving with the ball, which then has a knock on effect to the next action. Now he's reaching out with a straight leg. We can see the distance between the two feet is extending. So the further those feet are apart, the less balance we have, the less ability to generate speed and acceleration as we change direction. So we wanna make sure that as the ball is traveling, our feet are moving, we're getting our body in line with the ball. So when we make contact with the ball, we're able to make contact and get our body moving in the same direction. We also wanna look at the contact point with the footwork. So, and we can see here as the player's reaching out, we're now hitting the ball with the toe area of the left foot. So the surface area between the ball and the foot is gonna be limited. So we have less control. And we're also obviously planting our foot now on the left. So our momentum is gonna be going to the left as the ball's going to the right. So it's gonna affect our control and speed. We can also see from the distance the feet are apart, the body's in a very upright position. So we wanna make sure that we are able to move fluently with the ball to increase our balance, our speed and our control.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This by replacing the left toe with the right toe and since the hold is big, being that pinch he the climber was holding on above, he had placed first the right foot and then quickly released the left foot due to not being in a good position, being all crunched up so that left foot is going to be extended soon. Simms as the climber was keeping the feet where he first placed him when getting on the wall and wasn't able to move them up due to the climber keeping a wide pull-up motion when going out left to the hold. So the climber decides to bring his right hand to join onto a match onto the same hold. This one being a giant pocket that has a very closed lip. The climber can find this an easier hold on to hang on to. However putting pressure on top of the other hand can be risky as the climber may be chancing hurting the hand with the left hand so he has to make sure that he spreads out the the grip to be partially on the hold and not on top of the hand. But this so that the climber is able to move up his feet was probably the best choice that the climber made for this moment. The climber was to do this again. It would be ideal if the climber got to bring his right hand to completely beyond the edge of that pocket, meaning that he would have to make the left foot be on that block he had before and push away from it to create a stance so that the once the climber gets to get more leverage going out left, the right hand is positioned onto the side so now we'll be in a side pull. The climber will be inwards and so quickly could release the left hand for the next move. The climbers are starting at a two hand hold start. The right hand being a pinch, the left hand being a crimp. Now the pinches are holds that are easy to grab onto if the climber can keep the grip tight, meaning a closer grip. So this is slightly wider but also still close and having that thumb wrapped on the other side of that pinch can generate a lot of power when holding on to it. On the other hand we can see the crimp. So for the crimp the climber has a small edge and in order to sustain this the climber must put pressure by leaning on the fingers that are placed above. The fingers will need to roll in between the hold and the wall where it meets and this is so that the climber is able to place the fingertips and really use that small edge by leaning on it. The climber here had released the left leg and this to keep it into a flag out position. When glancing over realizing that the next hold is going to be out left and up, the climber is choosing to find the placement for his left toe. However, it starts engaging the arms to keep himself close or engage the core to also bring the foot at a higher stance but makes it not possible as the grip is is placed one on over the other and is definitely wearing out the grip. In this instance, the climber could have potentially kept the same position before and move quickly to the next hold. This is not the best way of holding onto the hold the climber is gripping onto so he needs to figure out what would be more efficient when attempting this move again. Here, the climber wasn't able before to bring the feet up since he was on a wide pull-up or two hands that were spread apart. And so he had sent his right hand in first and it can be complicated to place a hand on top of the other as long as the climber is able to somehow pinch the inner edge of that hold and not put full pressure on top of that hand to not injure it or create an over grip motion where there's a necessary pressure to be applied on the left hand. So the climber is why he's pinching, we can see with the thumb around it, on an area of that hold. Now that the climber was able to transfer the weight over to the grip to release the pressure down below, the climber was able to send the left foot at a higher stance. As we can see, the foot placement of the left foot is high stance but it's not going to be pressing down, instead it's going to be pressing away from it as the climber will need to go out left for the next move. The climber here gets in position. So once the climber places the feet at the wall, then the climb will start once he's off the mat. And in this case, we can see how the climber has applied the pinch, which is like a clamping motion. So the arm will always be engaged and it's hard for the climber to extend that arm. But in the other hand, to apply more pressure to that left grip, the climber keeps the arm extended. And because the left hand is not the most comfortable hold on to, hold on to, then the climber is possibly going to release the left hand first.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He's got two hands on it, love that. He's strong with it, it's balanced. His eyes are up. Again, he's choosing not to square all the way, but kind of drive deep baseline and shoot it back up over that shoulder. Again, here's that shot over the right shoulder, follow through. Again, he's pretty accurate here. Good push off here on that left foot, raising of the right knee, got that arm bar up, see that arm, that head comes off as he raises the basketball up. But it seems like he's got a really good look here, good landing, cushion, knees bent. Here's his follow-through back over that right shoulder. Again, keep that ball in tight. Try not to stick it out here, but good footwork here, stepping on that left foot to raise the right leg, eyes and head are up. Again, he's choosing to come back over that left shoulder, if you will, and not square up. Again, see how he sticks the ball out here? Again, it could be stripped by a defender, so you got to keep it in tight and protect it and take it straight up. Takes one big dribble. Footwork here is set up with that dribble. Again, you know, I wish he'd keep it a little more tucked in here. He's kind of sticking it out here. I love that his eyes and head are up. Put beautiful footwork and timing. Takes that left hand off the ball, but keeps it up there to kind of protect the ball, balance out his body. Here he raises the basketball up. Does a great job of keeping his eye on his target. Here's, see this right shoulder is not facing the basket. He's shooting it up over the shoulder. It's not my preferred way of shooting a reverse layup, but a lot of people shoot it this way. It's quick, especially when you're driving like deep baseline. Here's the baseline when you're dribbling down this way. That's a lot of times how people shoot it back over that shoulder. But he's got his hand spread, balls out in front of that hand. Here's one dribble. He picks it up. Better job of keeping it in the middle of his body, not sticking it out. Here comes the footwork. Right, right, left. Eyes are up. Yeah, here's the follow-through. Shoots it up over that right shoulder. Again, has a pretty good aim and target here. Beautiful landing. Knees bent. Seat down. Eyes up. Here, see, this is a good look, but he's got really good lift, footwork here. Again, in this type example of the reverse layup, he's not squaring his body, but he's shooting it back over his head. But the ball comes off those fingers nicely. It's under control and stable because he had two hands on it as he lifted the basketball. Again, right hand reverse layup, one dribble move, plant the left, pull the right up, arm bars bent, left arm bent, raising the ball up with that right hand. Again, he's choosing to kind of shoot it back over that right shoulder. I prefer you square and face your target. See how he shoots back over that arm, that shoulder. He's not really squaring up. See his hip, shoulder, they're not facing the basket or the baseline, but he's choosing to shoot it up over that shoulder. Nice lift and follow through here. He's starting in tight, takes one dribble, and has one big step, which is really a good way to learn how to do a reverse layup. Good foot, one dribble move, foot plant on that left foot, followed by the right knee. Again, let's get this ball in close. Let's not leave it out here on this left hip. So, the quicker we dribble and get it into this position in front of our body, the better off we are. Great job with his head and eyes being up. Here the shooter is shooting a going left to right, shooting a right hand reverse layup. He took one dribble. I love the fact that he's got two hands on the ball, but instead of sticking it out here to the left or down low, I'd love for him to keep it more in tight to the body and chest to protect it and be strong with it. He does a great job of lifting his head and eyes, pretty good footwork as well here. Beautiful foot placement, raising of the right knee. Here he's lifting the ball. I love that he keeps two hands on it. It's so important to maintain control and to be strong. Eyes are up. See how he's driving deep baseline? Here's the baseline. Good look here. Here's the look. And this is what I mean. And a lot of people shoot it this way. I prefer to square this right shoulder to the backboard. He's shooting, he's not squaring this right shoulder. He's shooting it up over the shoulder. Gotta stay with it. Gotta keep your eyes on that target. It's a tough shot to take and make. Again, follow through over that right shoulder. Again, another way to shoot a reverse layup. Not my preferred way. Maybe that's why I gave him an 8, but it does a great job of hitting the target here. Again, shoots over that right shoulder. He just doesn't square the shoulders and the hips. Ideally, I would love probably to see that way of shooting is squaring and being more fundamental. He kind of shoots it back over that right shoulder. And you can see that motion here. It looks like he's going to hit target here. Again, really doing a good job of hitting the target. Here's that shot over that right shoulder. Bends the knees on the landing. Here's the foot plant, the planting of the left foot, nice cover of distance here, comes that right leg in behind. Again, let's get the ball in tight, sticking it out here. Great job of knowing where he is in relation to the backboard by having his eyes and head up. Again, good timing footwork here, stepping on the left, pulling the right knee. So he's raising it up with two hands. He's being really strong with it. The ball's stable. Good look here. He chooses to go off the left foot, raise that right knee. He's kind of shooting over this right shoulder. You can kind of see that and in some cases that's how some people shoot a reverse layup. I prefer to square that right shoulder on that plant of the left foot and be more fundamental here, but in some cases this is how the reverse layup is shot.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And he wants to have kind of a really fluid kind of timed, almost reaction from his arms to his feet, where he kind of pulls himself into position and then lunges from his feet. But it seems like he kind of pumps his arms a little bit closer in and out and then kind of jumps for it. And this attempt, he is probably by far the lowest he is on it, so he probably needs to rest some and take more rest in between attempts.

They went right hand first, so you can tell that this climber is pretty comfortable on crimps because they grabbed that left hand crimp, which was intended to be an intermediate, and used it as the primary hold to move up the wall off of. So here we have the start position. It's a good look at this right hand sloper. Really good utilization of the thumb here on the high left side of this hold. Climber's able to get a pinch out of that and then left hand into this jug. And here the climber is opting to get this high left foot up and drop this right knee in a little bit and use that to manipulate the hips right into the jug. You can see they're looking up at the target hold here. And then after doing some ladder movement on some good holds, the climber is able to find themselves at the top jug for a pretty easy looking send of this boulder. And so the climber is easily able to get into this right hand tufa. And then trusting this left foot and pulling hard over it, the climber is able to get into this bad crimp right here. This is probably the worst hold on the boulder, and this climber seems to be pretty comfortable here.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Picture perfect here, boom, until we get up to here. We even have the L shape with the arm, but the guy hand really needs to be on the side and not shooting the ball with two hands. There's actually good flexion in the knees, but the feet are absolutely too close. We want to make sure that the legs are about shoulder width apart to have consistent balance. Pretty obvious that she's shooting with two hands. We want to make sure there's one primary hand that's pushing and guiding the ball, and one hand that's supporting the shot. Right here, as you can see, the follow through are going right behind her back after her shot goes up. There are no hands here to show that consistent follow through. The posture here is actually good, but everything else is is not full of the consistencies just need to be tailored into fundamentals and I think we could get better in more consistent results. Right here, dribbling down, there's no vision of the target. You want to make sure your eyes are always up on the target, no matter what you're doing. So just being able to jump with the going this separate is not a good way to land and then it shows the inconsistencies of her initial base. This kind of indicates that the shot is being controlled with two hands. Both of them seem to have follow-throughs, thumb to down, pointed finger to down, ensuring that we're able to identify the main hand versus the guide and support hand. Looks like the guy handed on top. You kind of want to just swing that around a little bit and ensure that guy handed on the side to not help support shooting the ball.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

When we shoot a jump shot, we want to make sure on the release of the ball that our elbow is slightly above our eyes. This will allow the ball to get good arc and go nicely into the basket. If the elbow is too low, the shot will be more flat and it will be harder for the ball to go into the basket. The shot will either hit the back of the rim or the front of the rim and we miss it that way. It's important that we have good arc because two basketballs can fit into a basket at the same time when they are dropped directly from above. We have a pretty big target in the basket and we only need to make one. If we can get good arc and now as it's coming into here, there's more space for the ball to go into the basket. If the shot is flat and slightly above the rim, it's really difficult for the ball to go into the basket because there's no room for the ball to go into the basket. It's really important that there's good arc on our jump shot and having that elbow slightly above our eye level is a good way of getting the proper arc on the ball. Also, we want to make sure that when we release the shot, the elbow isn't too high because if it's too high, that means the release is more straight up and down. If it's more straight up and down, that means all of the power that we generate is put into the ball going high into the air and then as it comes back down, more likely than not, it's going to be short. So, having the elbow slightly above our eye level on the release is a good indicator of us having the proper arc and allowing the ball to reach the rim. As the shooter catches the ball, his left foot is slightly in front of the right foot. And then he's going to take his right foot and then he's going to place it slightly in front of his left foot. This action of stepping into your shot gives the shooter momentum and rhythm to step into his shot and go in and give a nice jump shot. So it's really important to step into your shot in order to create the momentum and rhythm necessary for a good jump shot. Taking a look at the positioning of his feet, you see that his right foot is slightly in front of his left foot. This allows for his elbow to be locked in and closer to his body and aligned with the front of the rim. By having this position on the release and the elbow aligned with the front of the rim, this allows for each shot that he takes to be straight and on target going in the direction in which he releases the ball. If you take a look at his feet, as he releases the ball, he slightly jumps backwards and away from the basket. So he's jumping away from the basket on a lot of his shots, which by that action of jumping away from the basket, it actually makes the shot more difficult and it's harder to be consistent and make shots at a high percentage and consistently at a high percentage if we're constantly jumping away from the basket. So when he releases the ball, his momentum should actually be slightly forward towards the basket. We don't want the momentum, him to make a big jump and he's jumping, say, where you see where he's right here and then he jumps and shoots and then he lands all the way here. That's too much momentum forward. But as you see where his foot is here where he jumps, where he's taking off, he should either land in the same spot or slightly forward. As he releases the ball, you can see his right shooting hand. He does a good job of follow through, doing a follow through and making sure that he snaps his wrist. And from this view we can see the back of his hand so that lets us know that he does a good job of snapping his wrist and his fingers are pointing towards the basket. We take a look at his guide hand, which is his left hand. The palm of his hand is facing downward at this angle. We want his palm ideally should be his hand should be open and the palm is facing directly to the right. So when the palm is facing directly to the right as we release the ball, that ensures that that left hand has no influence on the ball whatsoever and the shot is being completed slowly with the right hand. As we turn our hand on the release and our palm is no longer facing this direction, but it starts to turn towards the basket or face downward, that tells us that that left hand is influencing the ball on the release however slight it may be. It's still a slight influence that the left hand is causing on the ball and we don't want that. So we want to make sure that the left palm is perfectly open and the palm is facing in the direction of the shooter's hand.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He shot really well. He made a lot of shots and technically everything was correct. Great high release above his head, this is going to help keep the ball away from defense and also give him a good arc and angle up the basket. His elbow is nice and tucked in front of him and bent at an almost 90 degree angle. Actually more, like a 120 degree angle. He's got a good little left-right one-two step into his jump shot. He's starting his shooting motion nice and low, which gives him kind of that rhythm and full body dip we want to see on jump shots. Great follow through here, he's got the wrist flick and the left hand is just supporting it. The right foot is also slightly in front of the left because he's a right-hand shooter.

I think they're afraid of plucking with that left hand. And by left I mean right hand. Not a great seating position, especially with the finger picking technique that he's choosing here. Elbow is also being blocked by the leg here. Much taller posture, maybe even standing overall would be a better position for this musician to access the fingerboard more effectively without having to block this arm. With some relationship here, Anak looks really good and their fingers are usually really curved and don't block the other strings from sounding appropriately. This musician is choosing to use a ring finger to play the repeated top notes. I would advise an alternation between the middle finger and the third finger to create those top notes instead.

And so the climber was able to get into this right hand, little sharp bucket looking thing, finger bucket looking thing, and able to match feet on this start hold sloper. And you'll just notice that they're kind of having to lock this down awkwardly and open up these hips. For one, their wall disappears here, but two, they're kind of having to dodge this big bulb. So sneaking this arm through and getting this left hand is kind of difficult. So here the climber is able to get into this left crimp.
