And so it looks a bit too casual and pedestrian. She's in this really non-specific shape here. It looks like she's kind of just putting her weight on a straight right leg. So again, when there's not any cushion or spring in the knees, it can make the movement look like low energy. And that's most likely because what's happening is she's resting on her joints rather than her muscles. So there frankly is lower energy there. The head movement here would be more effective if the elbows were out. She's kind of let her elbows collapse in a little bit here. So it makes it again look imprecise and weak. Quite imprecise and too small here as well. I'd love to see her exaggerate this more. She's sort of being kind of stiff with her arm movements and allowing she's doing this circular movement with her torso and the arms are sort of just Following that doesn't look intentional. It kind of looks stiff and awkward again Very weak base here. Her feet are too close together. Her knees are collapsing inwards She needs a little bit of a wider base to really move in a strong way This little section with these windmills with her arms, quite weak as well because it looks good for a moment as she's bringing the arms around, but then as soon as one arm comes in front of her face, she drops the windmill shape, and so she loses all the nice patterns that she had developed in the air. This movement also looks pretty stiff here, so what she's doing is bringing this arm around in front of her as her torso bends forward. The reason that it looks stiff, a couple of reasons. One is her knees are sort of collapsing inward, which is not a strong place to be dancing in. It'd be better if her feet were next to each other rather than in this front and back orientation. And also a bit further apart so she could have a nice strong base with a plie here and direct this movement from her pelvis. She's directing the movement from her chest and so that's partly why it looks stiff and weak because this is not a strong place to move from. If she was driving this movement with her pelvis it would look so much stronger. The arm looks good, nice straight elbow, very clear shape. The head gazing forward while the rest of the torso is bent makes this look quite awkward and stiff as well. She's doing a good job with the follow-through of this hand. She brought the hand in front of her face and has brought it all the way behind her head. So that's an example of good follow-through here. Again, lack of attack here. The music is very strong and it's also this particular section, this three counts here or three beats, three moments here are quite strong and sharp, but she's moving much more, she's technically on the beat, but she's using this sort of legato dynamic to what she's doing and so it really again looks more like someone who's sort of marking it rather than doing it full out. I'd love to see her exaggerate it and add more attack and more texture and dynamics to her movement. This is the most dynamic she has been so far in this choreography, so I'd encourage her to find ways to embrace the vibe of this little section and put that throughout the piece. She's got a lot of energy, she's moving her arms in a pretty clear and precise way that looks really well balanced by counterbalance by her leg movements. She's moving on the balls of her feet which is helping her to move quickly and smoothly, so this is a really nice little section for her. Again, lack of energy here. She's done this sort of ball change behind her. This could have been like even a little bit of a leap or something to just give this some interesting dynamics, but there's a lack of attack. And so again, not super interesting. Again, this movement is way too small, not exaggerated enough. I needed her to plie through this right leg more, leap onto the left foot as she's turning, keep this knee straight out, and also have the arms much more connected and in sync with the legs. The arms are a little bit behind. Because she didn't do any of those things, and also you can see she's quite weak through her, I don't know exactly which part of her body is weak, but her knees continue to collapse inward. And so that's not a strong place to be moving from. So this turn really doesn't come across very well. It's way too small and lacks follow through. She's doing a pretty good job here of isolating her ribcage. However, again, there's a lack of dynamics. There's a lack of attack There's a lack of energy And so it really again, it just doesn't look super interesting. It's giving this sort of a monotone Vibe and the low energy coming from her makes it just less interesting for her viewer Also, there's an imprecision and lack of clarity with the arms in this section as well This is good arm movements on both sides. She did a nice straight elbow and a nice arc to the front of her body and then slowly brought a graceful hand in front of her body and she did this consistently with good follow-through on both sides. Here she started the choreography. The main issue I have with her performance is that she doesn't exaggerate the movements and actually do them fully. She gives this vibe of like she's marking this, not that she's doing it full out. She doesn't exaggerate the movements enough to make them look crisp and performative. This is supposed to be a kick. She does a tiny little kick here, but she doesn't really get this knee straight. She has plenty of music to do it, but she doesn't attack it soon enough, so she can't fully get there. Also, that's reflected in her arm shape here. There's not a lot of energy coming from her core out through her arms. There's not a lot coming out through her facial expressions either. So what I'd like her to do is exaggerate her movements and attack them more. This series of turns is very weak and choppy and clunky and that's because she is using her hip as her pivot point rather than the balls of her feet. So what she's doing is planting one foot fully on the floor and then turning around that hip and then doing the opposite with the other side. So she's having to do four to five movements per turn instead of one to two movements and so she ends up kind of imprecisely moving across the floor in this sort of bumpy way. Also she's not really spotting her head and that would also help her to be a bit more precise and stay in one place as she turns. This is a really nice shape with these arms here, great elbows, great shoulders, really nice graceful wrists and hands. My problem is again the dynamics. She came up really slowly and then tipped her arms forward, so it's giving this sort of like wilting flower vibe that does not fit at all with this music. I think this would have been much more effective if she would have hit the shape quickly with attack again, attack, attack. There's not enough texture and dynamics in what she's doing here, and that's part of why. Also again, low energy through the lower half of the body. I would encourage her to think about what can she do to connect these two halves of her body and dance with her whole body the whole time. Here she's doing this turn where she swings the knee out and in front of her body. This is a really ineffective moment for her, again low energy. There's low energy in what she's doing, there's not a lot of strength, there's not any really major exaggeration, so it all looks kind of weak, wilting, and monotone. Also as she's turning here it's good that she's got her weight a little bit forward on the ball of her foot. You can see there's some space between her heel and the floor, that's good, that means that she's going to use the small pivot point of her ball of her foot to turn. She's not doing anything with her arms of interest, her arms are sort of reactionary. Here I'd love to see her either make a shape with the arms that reflects what's happening with the legs or do something with them to help her momentum in this turn. This leg is also not very precise, I'd love to see her choose a shape that looks a little bit more clear and intentional. Again, a good shape here with the arms and hands, but she doesn't attack it enough, so she runs out of music, so she can't hold the shape at all, so it doesn't read very well as a shape, and also again, lack of texture is making the whole piece sort of monotone. Here's a little transition moment that looks really weak. It's, she doesn't, she kind of stands here in a way for a moment. It's not really clear what she's about to do. Part of the reason that that doesn't, that it looks low energy in her lower half of her body, she doesn't keep a soft knee. This knee here is very, very straight. It's really hard to continue moving from a place of straight knee. It's, it's appropriate to have a straight knee from time to time, but when you don't have any spring in that joint, that's one reason that movement can look kind of bored. Like she's almost like she's bored or like she's marking and not doing a full out. Good job with this arm here. She's bringing, she brought it up in front of her chest with a bent elbow and is swinging it around with a nice straight elbow here. However, again, not a lot of energy is kind of hanging, her hand is sort of hanging there. There's not a lot of oomph into these steps that she's taking here. I'd love to see her attack this arm movement more, but keep this nice shape that she made.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

Yeah, it seems to be the ring finger or possibly the middle finger on the top notes that is not speaking clearly, which skews the rhythm. The hammer-on effect, via placing the finger down in between the plucking of the right hand, was very clean. The speed of the previous section compared to this slower section could have been exaggerated further by starting the slowdown earlier. It would have made for a less drastic ritardando and a smoother transition from one section to the other. Placement of fingertips on strings in relation to frets is very good. You can tell with the clarity of each note when plucking and switching between positions and chords. This is a correct use of this cord to easily switch between other cords when the other two fingers are required. The right hand plucking has deteriorated in its rhythmic integrity. Regardless of the rushing, musicians left hand is very precise and efficient at switching between the chords. Repetitious thumb notes, bum bum, tends to be a little on the rush side which causes the rest of the finger plucking to get faster. Musicians are also much faster now than they were at the beginning. Curvature of fingers is excellent. Placement of thumb stays consistent when shifting from position to position. Slight hesitation on the top couple of notes may have missed the note or a rhythmic choice made by the composer in the music. This is the first spot where clarity of notes was not clean. After the shift, position of finger on fret was suspect. Experiment with that shift and placement of those fingers to clear up sound. The musician is rushing here. I cannot tell if it's part of the music or if it is a personal choice for practicing. Last harmonic did not speak, consult finger placement and or approach from shift. Shifting was very smooth. You could tell that the hand and forearm was relaxed because the thumb came with the rest of the fingers of the same hand. Plucking of the right hand fingers is very rhythmic and does not rush.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So the climber must continue to apply pressure, especially onto the right hand grip since it's the one that is going to be furthest away from the climber. So he must squeeze on that pinch in order to pull himself back onto the wall. Once the climber gets close towards the wall, he will have to send one of the feet back onto the wall to stabilize the move. For more information, visit www.FEMA.gov Unfortunately the climber on losing the right hand grip, his center of gravity was thrown off and his left hand has also popped from the placement ending the climb. The climber continues to glance over to the hold at reach and is dropping his center of gravity. This one by extending the arms as the climber continues to glance over to the hold at reach, he will have to commit into dynamic move. The dynamic move means that the climber will perform a very quick pull into the wall as soon as he drops the weight and then will have to push forcefully onto the left foot to spring out of his position in order to get the hold at reach. It is important the climber always glances down at the feet, especially if performing a foot switch. The technique that he's applying is called the jump off jump on. So he jumps off the left foot where the heel was applied towards the surface of the hold before the right toe comes into place. Once the climber gets to place the foot, then he will have to create pressure to sustain the foot placement. This type of technique works especially in a large hold or medium-sized hold like this one, but it's often not accurate. This is because the climber might have to readjust the foot placement once the climber gets to place it, and it can take a fair bit of energy. As we can see the climber has sent the left hand over to the next hold at reach, placing the fingers into one side and the thumb onto the other. This is again a pinch grip so the climber must create pressure by squeezing onto the hold. For the climber on making the reach he had brought the right leg to be extended and pushes the foot forward towards the wall. This helps the climber to gain a stability as well as balance when going up for the move. The flag is also to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. The climber was able to reach the next hold that reached this one. The climber had committed a dyno. A dyno means that the climber had pushed forcefully onto the foot, coming out of place and hoping to have land the left hand grip as he has already done, placing the fingers behind the lip of the hold. And to apply extra pressure to the grip, the climber is placing the thumb over the outside to squeeze onto it. This is an immediate drop of his weight to the highest grip, so the climber must create a lot of pressure onto that left hand grip to sustain the swing. Eventually the climber will go out onto a swing. Since both of their feet are out in the air, this is called cutting feet. The moment that the climber had swapped the feet, kept the right leg extended. This is called flagging out, so he's able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. And at this time, the climber is glancing over to the next hold at reach. This one, the climber is keeping the left knee out to keep the hips square when performing the move. At this moment, the climber had brought the right toe to be pressed against the wall so that he's able to balance over the move as well as gaining a civility on his position. And had committed, as we can see, into a slight pull in. And at this moment, the climber has not gone up for it, so he hesitated for a slight second. This, keeping the arms engaged the whole time, can tire the arms, so the climber must move out of this position quickly. The climber secures the right hand grip and extends the arm right away. This is to transfer over the weight to the grip. Keeping the arm extended is ideal when climbing so the climber doesn't have to engage on the arm muscles giving it a moment for recovery. Now the climber is glancing down at the feet and he's performing a foot switch. This time the climber is bringing the left toe to come into place above the hold. Once creating pressure he's able to release the right foot from its place. The clamber making hand gestures is called visualizing. So he is shaping with his hands the way that he will sustain the hold, as well as throwing the hand from move to move to solve the sequence. As the climber was returning back onto the wall from the swing, he has engaged into the core. This to recover the move by sending the foot towards a hold on the wall in order to stabilize. But in doing so, when the climber was pulling himself in, his right hand has slipped off the hold. Now the climber is only having one point of contact, being the highest grip, which just came into place, potentially not being placed correctly as it was a one-shot, where the climber didn't have the time to adjust it, which is important. The climber applies a foot in order to reapply the left hand grip. In this case, it will be really hard for the climber to recover the move suddenly this happening, as this is one of his main points of contact in order to return to the wall. So the climber was able to make the next hold at reach, this one bringing the right hand at distance. So the climber once had created a foot switch, had brought the left leg to be extended. This is called flagging out, so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. And right before the climber went up for the move at reach, we can see how he had brought his right knee inwards. This is to keep the right side of the body close to the wall, helping the reach. For the climber to gain a stability on sustaining his center of gravity being in the core towards the wall has been done by the left foot being pushed against the wall. The clamber of creating small pull-ups is to release some of the pressure and readjust the grip as the clamber must create friction and accuracy on the placement by creating pressure, potentially placing the hand further in or finding a better spot for the grip to be squeezed on. The climbers is starting at a one-hold start where he places both of the hands onto the same hold. For the left hand is placed with the fingers flat at the above the hold and brings the palm forward to touch against the hold. This will increase the contact as well as pressure in closing the grip. For the right hand the climber places the fingers at the top and then places the thumb underneath. This will help the climber to squeeze onto the hold to transfer over the weight in creating pressure as well as the climber sustaining onto the pinch the climber must pull the elbow out compared to the left hand grip the climber must continue to bring the elbow also out to the left side and close to the wall when the climber gets to step off the mat. This type of a start the climber is doing a step up start and is placing the left heel behind the edge of the wall above the hold. This type of heel placement the climber then will secure with placing the outer edge of the heel towards the hold and that way the climber once creates pressure will help the climber to bring the hips up to a rise and then transfer over the weight to the placements. Once the climber gets to place the right foot towards the wall and is no longer standing on the mat then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So it really should be a level change here. Her head stays at the same plane as it was before when she was standing up. But this step ultimately should be lower. Her head should be further down in space because she's bending her right knee. She's looking towards the side, which is distracting. She should be looking straight forward and not turning her neck off of alignment with the rest of her back or spine, which is facing forward. The dancer does a good job of straightening both arms here. Both arms are in straight lines, which is really good arm extension. The dancer has really good force in her head when she's circling it here. She drops her chin downward and looks downward to start, and while she's circling her head now she's looking upward into space. So that's really good. She is circling or completing a full circle with her head. It's a really good range of motion there. The dancer also makes an audible noise with her mouth and grabs her pants with her hands, which while she's flustered or frustrated to hear that she forgets the dance, but it makes it more obvious that she forgets the dance by doing these motions. So she really should remain in character and not break character here. The dancer forgets a routine here, so she really needs to go over the steps so that she does not forget the sequence. The dancer is doing a good job here being on her toes with her heels lifted off the ground, both her right heel and her left heel, which is allowing her to execute this twisting motion and both her knees and her hips going side to side because her heels being lifted off the ground gives her that mobility. The dancer is now making her steps smaller. The side basic step that she just did right and left took up a lot less space than the rest of her steps, so she should make all her steps equal. All should be large, none should be smaller than the others. She might or want to or should lower her left arm that's in front of her slightly downward because as we see here she can see her hand so it's blocking her face a bit so she might or should lower her arm to be slightly lower and this in turn would also allow her to lower her shoulders a bit so that her neckline is longer. The dancer is pointing her foot at her ankle joint, which is good, but she's not finishing the line with her toes Her toes are pointed outward even though her ankles pointed downward so her toes should continue aligned with her ankle pointing downward", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

You could also crack it on the edge of the bowl or the countertop, but cracking it with the spoon above the bowl eliminates any egg getting on your countertop or workspace. I believe also that in mixing this omelet or this egg mixture, using a fork or a whisk would have been more appropriate tool than a spoon. Using a fork or a whisk incorporates air into the mixture so you produce a fluffier omelet with that egg. At this point, the omelet is completely cooked on both sides. However, he flips it 10 or 20 more times in rapid succession. This indicates to me that he doesn't have a very strong knowledge of how to cook an omelet. You really only need to flip it one time, cooking on the underside and then flipping it to complete cooking of any raw ingredients on the other side. For a one egg omelet, I would recommend only up to a fourth of a teaspoon of salt. Whenever you're chopping an onion with or any vegetable with an exterior skin, prior to chopping it or slicing it, you want to remove the skin and throw it in the garbage or remove it from your cutting surface, so that there's not an opportunity for that skin to get mixed into the chopped vegetables that you're going to use for the recipe. Here you can see that he is starting to slice his onion that he's going to use for the recipe. But here is all of the skin still sitting on the cutting board. You can tell in his movements that because he's already got the pan on and the oil heating, he feels like he is rushing around to get all of the ingredients now. This is why I always suggest to have all of your ingredients either grabbed or mixed together before you start the heat of the pan. This is a misstep in my opinion. He should wait to start the heat after he's either already gathered his tools and ingredients or finished mixing his omelet mixture. And as you can see, he's trying to pick around the skin that he should have thrown away in order to transfer his actual onion to the mixing bowl. Similarly, he slices his onion in half lengthwise and then begins to chop half of it with the skin still on. You can see that he hasn't taken the skin off here. This flipping and pressing over and over is a very unnecessary step and indicates to me that he isn't efficient with this particular task. He flips the omelet here successfully with very little splatter and then allows it to cook for a few seconds on this side. He seems to be really struggling with getting the entire omelet underneath to be on the flat spatula so that he can flip it. I believe that this is because there is a concentration of heavy and wet ingredients in the center of the omelet. After completely slicing the pepper, he plans to move it into the bowl, but as you can see, he puts his hand directly under the blade of the knife. This is a major mistake, in my opinion. He should have gathered the chopped peppers to the side and then transferred them to the bowl. I'm not exactly sure. This knife is very dull, but this indicates a lack of knowledge of how to appropriately use the tools in this recipe. He does grab a flat spatula, which is an appropriate tool to use. In making this, he adds his omelet mixture or egg mixture into the pan on top of the oil. Step one in making an omelet is gathering all the tools that you will need for this recipe. Here he gathers what is there equivalent to a frying pan. It's a flat surface. It looks to be cast iron. It would be appropriate at this step, as he's mixing his egg mixture to form the omelet, to now put on the heat on the pan. He seasons with half a teaspoon of salt. He has chosen a pepper. It looks like this is a small serrano and then also a red onion. You can see immediately the outside of the omelet is almost cooked while the inside where the egg mixture is thicker and the vegetables are sitting is still raw. This is happening because his mixture is uneven and he didn't spread it out and also because his pan was very hot prior to him adding the egg mixture. This is why I always recommend cutting on the pan after you've assembled or mixed all of your ingredients. Here he is adding to the pan what appears to be a cooking oil, two tablespoons to be exact, and I think that's an appropriate amount for this particular recipe. However, he's adding the oil and cutting on the pan too soon. However, he begins to light the flame before gathering any of the other tools or the ingredients necessary to produce this omelette.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

The climber then gets a left foot up into the second hand in the sequence. And locking this right hand down, the climber is able to snake this left hand up into this undercling pocket here, which I think is quite good. It's only two fingers, but I think it goes pretty deep into the wall. So here, climber started on this hold down here, perched over a really good foot, darted left hand into this jug. Here they are with their feet switched, right foot's on now, and looking up into the wall, proceeding. Kyra then attempts to do a rollout into this crimp here after matching this big orange hold and I just think is too tired and loses. Just is not able to tag that hold. Climber was then able to build their feet off of this undercling jug pocket and roll out into this right-hand jug here.

Snaps that wrist down. Guide hand is not in his shot. Bring that elbow in of the guide arm. And again, you could see how the right leg gets kicked out in front of him. And a lot of his lift and upward motion is coming from the push off of that left foot. Let's balance it out here. My recommendation is maybe moving in closer so you can really work on the feet, getting his feet under him and landing with a more balanced landing. Again, you can see all the weight again falls on that left foot. I like that his feet are apart, but his landing is really that weight's kind of falling back on that left foot. And here again, he kind of short arms it, pulls that follow through back. You can see the bending of the elbow. Let's extend that elbow and keep it out there. And then you can see the landing. He kind of again lands solely on that left foot. I'd love to see more of a balanced landing if you will and hold that follow-through with that right arm. Same thing here, let's extend this elbow shooting hand. Much better job here with the guide hand. Again, when he lands, he's kind of straight up with his weight kind of back a little bit. We love for him to go up and come straight down in the same spot. Again, a lot of his push-off is on the left foot. You can see the right leg go up. And then he lands on his foot as well. So again, just kind of maybe a little casual in his approach here. Would love to see a more stronger, aggressive takeoff and landing. But, you know, he's got a really nice touch. He's got some really good form shooting here. Again, when he lands, he kind of lands straight up. We'd love to see more knee bend, more him getting lower. He's kind of just standing straight up, falling back on his left foot. Here, the shooter is shooting a 15-footer from the foul line area. In the ego view, you can see a beautiful extension of the shooting arm, which is the right arm. You've got an extended elbow. You've got a breaking of the wrist. You can start to see those fingers pointing down. The guide hand, not too bad. I'd like to see that elbow come in a little bit and get more parallel, the forearm parallel to the floor. You don't want the elbow sticking out, but not bad. He's got great lift and elevation. I would like to see him maybe get off the floor a little bit more. He does a lot of his takeoff off the left foot. The right foot is just kind of up in the air, but a lot of his lifting and push-off is coming from just one foot, the left foot, and also on the landing. The beautiful extension here of the arms. Again, you know, take off the left foot, landing on the left foot, his center of gravity is back. You can see him kind of fading here. Let's really hold this follow-through and extend that right elbow. Pretty good breaking of the wrists there on that follow-through. Again, you can just see the push-off of the left foot. Not a lot of push-off here of the right foot. Would love that to be more equally distributed. But beautiful extension here. Let's get that guide hand with a palm facing in more and get that elbow in. But this is nice. He's got a pretty good, you know, releases the ball at the height of his jump. Again, you could see him, he just pushes off that left foot. He doesn't get a lot of push off with the right. So again, I'd love to see more of us being ready and stepping into this pass left, right, and equally distributing your weight on both feet to go up off the air. But again, pretty good extension here, may have short armed it just a tad here by pulling that elbow back, but beautiful breaking of the wrist on the follow through.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He's going off the right foot or the correct foot with the left foot and he's extending high with his right hand. It's great. I'd give him a nine. He missed one.

He's got a shooting hand behind the ball. The guide hand comes off, but it's still there. See it in the picture. And again, it's just offering a line of protection between the ball and a potential defender. That defender is gonna have to come across him to get the ball. And that's tough to do without fouling. So great job there. Look how he steps on that left foot, uses it to square, he's starting to square his hips and body to the basket. Lifts it with two hands, with the shooting hand behind, the guide hand on the side. That guide hand starts to come off. Eyes and head are up. Nice job. Again, lands with his knees bent on two feet, more balance, stability here. His eyes and head, he's still seeing the ball into the basket. Again, great push off of the left foot, right knee raises. You know, he's in a really good position here. Look how he's got that guide hand, that left hand, just on the side for support as he raises it from the ground up to where he wants to release it. Beautiful push off of the left foot. That's the correct foot for this drill. Lifting of that right knee, which powers and extends the body up. Great look here with two hands. That guide hand is there. Just some token pressure, but it comes off as you prepare to release it from your right hand. Good landing, staggered stance, knees are bent, head and eyes are up. Great use of the backboard. Look how he squares his body. You know, that left foot, the footwork has so much to do with getting your body ready. So the left foot pushes off, the right knee goes up, comes down, arm bars up, beautiful extension of the shooting arm. And there's the lift of the right knee. But look how that left foot helps him pivot and square his body. He still has two hands on the ball. That guide hand or non-shooting hand is on the left. He's got his shooting hand behind the ball. Eyes and head are up. Look at this stride here. He's covering distance. Big old step, stepping off that left foot. That left foot then is gonna almost become a pivot foot where it helps square his whole body to the basket. Two hands on the ball, better control. It's just a strong basketball position. Again, his shoulders are square, his body, he's not shooting sideways, he uses his feet to help square his body so that he's facing his target. Nice job there. Look at the look at the ball come off those finger tips. Nice job. Great look here at a reverse right hand layup. Love the push off of the left foot on that right side. The pulling of the right leg and knee up as you extend your body to shoot it. I love how he's got two hands on the ball. That right hand shooting hand is behind it. His guide hand is on the side. In this picture you can start to see the guide hand come off as he prepares for the shot. His eyes and head are up. His body is in a really good relationship to the backboard so that he can use it to finish the shot. Here it is. You know, I would probably bring the ball in a little bit tighter. He took that dribble and he's kind of stuck it out here. Again, a defender could steal that. So let's, you know, dribble. Let's keep it in a little bit tighter to our body. But great footwork, good distance between the feet as he pulls the right leg in. Great footwork, spacing, that move sets up this shot, eyes and head are up, two hands on the ball, he knows where he is because he's looking up. There's the release. Beautiful extension here of the right shooting arm, snapping of the wrist. His target is the top of that square. Beautiful extension here. Push off looks really, really good. I love how he used this one dribble move. He dribbled it with his right hand right out in front of him, quickly lets it take him to the basket. So now he's ready to, off this right hand dribble, to step with this left foot. Look how he's looking up. He's got two hands on the ball. He knows what he wants, where he needs to go. Again, here's a great look in the same shot of that guide hand coming off. But look how it's still there. It's at 90 degree. There's a defender. He's got his body between the defense and the basketball. You can see it right there. Great job.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

It should actually be, I want to say, in opposition there. So the dancer is moving the body back to the front, rocking it with the arms. It should actually be in opposition of one another there in that movement. The dancer needs a lot more isolation here between the lower part of the body and the upper part. Again, controlling those arms would be nice for the dancer's movement. Placing the elbow out a little bit away from the body would also be more clear. And again, we wanna see a little bit more dimensionality, more variety between the lower part of the body here and the upper part of the body where they meet in the waist and the hips in that area. The dancer does a good job in terms of the sequen-tionality or the sequence of the movement and is aware of the choreography, but it's the execution where we want to see more consistency with the movement, more energy, more fluidity in moving throughout the dance, throughout the whole body. That should be more strong. There should be stronger intentionality behind that. So that step with that shift in the ankle and that step out on the right, the dancer's got to step out far more to start that movement with that energy. Okay, and the dancer's arm really should be more strongly extended from the shoulder. Dancer is losing a lot of energy. The movement is fizzling down a bit here. The dancer loses a little bit of energy here, so we want to see energy consistent and throughout. The dancer's movement there with that body roll should really be initiated more with the head and then goes into the neck, the rest of the body. The dancer does attempt to achieve this and ends up doing it twice almost because it was so fast because it was just the top part of the body which stopped here.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And to have more energy throughout. Start out with great energy. Be consistent with the energy. The dancer does a great job coordinating the steps to the left and the right, but I believe the movement is for the dancer to push out with the hand on both sides, and the dancer is giving more of a cupping of the hands towards the sky. So that's beautifully executed, but I'm not sure if that's supposed to be the choreography or the pressing out with the hands. Dancer does a great job bringing those arms around.

Assuming that it wasn't used in assisting him to actually shoot the ball. As you can see he kind of shot off of his left ring and pinky finger which shows inconsistencies whereas he shot the ball early off his pointed finger and his middle finger. So just being consistent on which finger the ball actually rolled off of will help you tremendously in being able to make shots over and over. Right here, it says statue is straight up, follow through is down there, the other follow through is down there. We want to make sure that follow through stays up and that guy hand is short, the shooting hand is long. Right here, first thing I see is covering up the target. You want to make sure that ball is either shifted to the right or coming over the top, seeing as if he's potentially a right-hand shooter. Right here I could see that he does not have shoulder width apart spacing and if it's free throw normally one foot would slightly be ahead of the other. Assuming he's a lefty, that left foot is probably designed to be ahead of the right just a tad versus both feet being side by side and closely aligned. Yeah, right here it shows these two fingers are pointing towards the ball. The offhand is here. So assuming he's lefty, but then again, he's covering up his vision, which indicates that he can shift it to the right or brought over the top on the left.

Not sure if that was in the Written in the music but Being able to clear the sound before the shift would be good there to avoid a glissando Even though the glissando was pleasing to hear The musician continues to play with really nice placement of fingers to get a clear sound. Not a clean shift for that melody note here. really fluid fingers here. Every note is speaking very clearly and that means he's got a good acquisition of all notes on the fret. This bar in that first finger is really hard to get clear for all of those notes there and it's really good. Right hand does a really good job plucking with evenness and equal weight between the fingers so that not one finger sounds louder or stronger than the other. It's very pleasing to listen to. The correct fingering was played here for that second finger as opposed to the first time. Didn't speak here because his finger wasn't pushed down enough by the time he got to the note. His left hand is well practiced. Very few notes are missed and the curvature of his fingers stays very consistent throughout every single stroke and chord change. This is a well-practiced musician. Masterful use of lower bass notes playing quickly while other fingers sneak across to play a melody note on top. Very highly skilled. Really nice improvisation moment for this musician to play through that melody with all the added extra notes There's really good moments of consistent rhythm. But we miss it sometimes when there's a slightly more difficult scale pattern or run that gets in the way of the other main groove. I want to feel that groove the whole time, even if it's a displaced part of the groove. I still want to feel like I'm able to move to the groove the whole time and I'm not getting that here. I feel like the fast notes in this movement are fast just for the sake of being fast without much direction. I'm not sure how they connect to the chordal sections. I just feel that there could be a little bit more direction within those fast notes to progress us through the next set of chords that he's going to play for us. harmonics weren't as clearly spoken as they could have been here. Another example of using a first finger instead of a second finger for that scale down. He makes it work, but it's not the best fingering. Another first finger choice here instead of a second finger. A little bit of rubato here, I'm losing sense of tempo. Position also looks really good. Classical style of positioning with the foot pedal on the left foot and instrument at a pretty steep angle up the body, allowing for the fingers and hands to be in a really good position. My one suggestion so far is I'm not hearing a lot of dynamic changes. It's just a lot of the same kind of a sound. And I'm not sure what direction the melody is supposed to be going. Are we increasing to a climax? Or are we getting away from a climax? I just like to hear more direction in the phrasing. Much better use of that third fret second fret shift to second first fret without a glissando there. I like that one much better I actually thought that was a lot more convincing here. I could actually hear rubato and follow it, even though I lost the groove. He was able to bring the close of the phrase better because he measured it a little bit more clearly. We're getting a little bit of a Zing at the end of a note because he's lifting the finger up Too early from the fingerboard which causes the string to rattle against the fretboard Much better tempo here compared to the last time he played this section. I chose to play a first finger on the second fret rather than a second finger, maybe because this finger is stretched out all the way, curving this one in isn't as effective, but I would still advise the student practice getting that second finger there instead of the first finger. much better with the tempo and the groove. Really good placement and chord switching here with fingers going close to the frets and the fingers being agile enough to switch between chords quickly.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This is a great attempt at attack Annie. I would encourage the dancer to send those hips back pressing Pressing the top of the body the torso more down to the ground and bending those legs even further So they have a smaller Smaller area they needed to work from from their distance of their basically their head to the ground There they would have less distance They would have to cover which would make the attack Annie easier to accomplish It's hard to accomplish an attack Annie when you're standing up Very very straight and the back is erect So this would improve the overall technique of this movement That spin was really good. I would encourage them to spot while they spin a little bit quicker, but also to make sure that throughout the entire dance, they have a little bit more precision. So thinking about where their feet should be, where their hips should be, how far they should be bent over, what should they be doing with their legs, especially what should they be doing with the shoulders because they tend, this dancer in all their videos tends to hunch over a little bit, and thinking about the placement of the neck and the head. And all of these qualities working together, the precision and articulation of each of the body parts would improve the overall proficiency of this choreography dramatically. I would encourage the dancers to have more hustle and attack here so they can stay on the rhythm. And overall they can improve the overall energetic quality and dynamic quality of the dance. I would encourage the dancers to roll their shoulders up back and out because they're kind of hunched over right now. So it would give them more presence and dynamic quality throughout the dance. Here I repeat my comments about being off of the beat and making sure they do that homework to learn the rhythm. Through this whole section when the dancer kind of bounces back and forth throughout the floor is a moment if they were more grounded they could use their hips to be able to more effectively sway back and forth, which would improve the technique of the dance. Because they're doing a shim-sham-shimmy for this, they should definitely be on the balls of their feet and send their weight down and open up their legs so they can kind of pivot, kind of swing on this pendulum back and forth for the shim-sham-shimmy. And then they can be able to more efficiently kick that leg over. Do you like my diagram? They'll be able to kick that leg over. So they'll go moving those hips back and forth for the shim-sham-shimmy on the balls of the feet and then be able to more efficiently have a great range of motion to be able to kick that leg over.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She's able to apply that pressure down straight through that foothold. And now the left foot is kind of smearing into the wall, staying tensioned. And that's going to let her kind of push herself up to the hold. Again, it does a good job walking the feet through, but again, this non-tensioned foot is just loose and flopping around. It's actually kind of pulling her away from the wall. She's trying to do these moves. So overall staring off pretty good, keeping the arms nice and straight, kind of staying opposite pose, but has a tendency to kind of let their other foot drop off the wall. So like she's towing it with her left foot really good, but this right foot is kind of just hanging loosely off. That's actually kind of pulling her hips away from the wall. So ideally she could kind of tighten that in, flag it, put it on another hold, smear it into the wall, and let that kind of assist her drive upwards. Again, we can see that just how, you know, she drops that right foot again and just is flopping out so far from the wall. And it's just really getting her hips up from the wall and having her kind of compensate with the upper body. Here we can see just how far it's pulling her out. It's just yanking her hips off the wall. So she doesn't have to fight all that to bring herself into the wall again.

So the dancer starts with a salsa just stepping forward and back. She's coming in with a really nice energy, just getting her body moving and getting ready for the step. Her knees are bent and she is stepping forward on that leg and rotating her arms around and her eyes are looking forward and out to the audience.

Um, unfortunately I don't know what hand is next because he doesn't make it to it. Now here it's maybe he's supposed to do a different move because he attempts to kind of use the top part of this hold which kind of has a slope and down edge so he's not able to grab it so he tries to match it which is kind of putting his hands on top of his hands already. So it looks like maybe he's not quite sure or confident in what the next moves are going to be and where he should go and what he should be doing. So maybe this was his flash burn and as he gets more tries in deep he'll kind of figure out the moves a little bit better. He has a fairly good starting position, arms are nice and straight, kind of engaged. Especially on this right arm where it's a little bit more pinchy. He's a little bit more bent and a little bit more actively gripping on this as he's going to move up with his left hand first. So overall, nice starting position, maintains some good power and tension through it. Doesn't really relax on the one arm because I think he needs to be a little bit more actively engaged to really engage with that pinch and pull through that pinch. So you can see he's in the process of kind of maybe swapping the feet but he does bring his left foot up high Which is kind of a problem because his left hand is below so he's kind of in a barn door position He's gonna have to move his right hand first. So when he does that he's gonna kind of be His whole body's gonna kind of want to rotate out So maybe not the most ideal situation but you can kind of swap it and do a backflip to put right foot on kind of get this kind of tension foot out here Should kind of make it easier to do the next couple moves And here for this move he kind of comes up he hits this kind of Waco style hold That looks pretty positive he kind of Changes his grip around on it, but it settles on this kind of open hand grip You can see once he kind of finds that kind of optimal spot He then straightens his arms his arm is nice and straight and he kind of shifts his whole body To the left to kind of be hanging underneath it and not to fight it And then once he's in this position he kind of goes to readjust and keep tension on his feet", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The bowl is pretty small, so for her to whisk and get some air in there, it would be difficult, especially since she's using a spoon. If she were using a fork, this might be a little easier. Here she adds a little bit more oil to the edges. It's not necessary, but if it makes her feel better, I guess it's fine. It's something you should oil correctly the first go around. and taking her spoon to crack her egg. She moves to an alternative burner to get her stove back lit, but her pan was well heated because you can hear it still cooking as it's set to the side. Now she drizzles a little bit of oil in there. Because the pan is larger in diameter than the amount of eggs, she doesn't get a nice circle, but she is spreading out the egg that's uncooked. It's sitting on top with the back of her spoon. She's adding another spice which could be a curry or a masala blend. Now she's making cross cuts there to make sure that it's the same cut size as the onion. Here she's beginning to test the edges of her omelet with her spatula just to make sure they're not sticking. And you can see from these white areas that her egg wasn't fully incorporated because that would be egg white specific cooking. And this is cooking quickly, which is normal for warm pans. And we're almost ready. She's lighting the stove on her gas stove top. She's added that onion to the bowl with her spices. Now she's making smaller cuts to result in a small dice. She's adding some oil to her pan now. She's adding some turmeric to her small bowl. Her pepper's been added to her bowl with onion and spices. Her omelet's quite thin, she has to be pretty careful. And now she has a long metal spatula. She's having to more stir it and move it. And adding a pan, it looks to be a cast iron, flat bottom with very low slope sides. And you can see it does break a little as she flips it.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He's kind of hooking it, if you will, and you can kind of see how he shoots over his body instead of getting that shooting hand behind the ball and having more of a direct path here. But not bad. He definitely has his eyes and head up and he's aiming for that square. Lands on two feet, seems really balanced, maybe bend the knees and drop the hips a little bit. But again, it kind of shoots around and you can see that shooting elbow out. We'd like it to be in and under the ball, but the ball does come off these fingers, which is really good here. Again, I would square this right shoulder up a little bit. You can see here barely, but he's kind of hooking it. So he's got a really long distance to go here. Instead of squaring that right shoulder up and getting that shooting hand a little bit more behind the ball. And have it shoot it more in front of you instead of out from you.  Here he then follows with the left step, again gathers it off the dribble, puts it in two hands, eyes and head are up. Again, I really feel like his movement, that dribble, those steps, could definitely be more aggressive so that he could explode and lift his body up into his shot. You know, just be more aggressive overall. I think he really has the skill level to do that. He lands softly on the... when he comes down. Not a lot of room to come down, but he does do a good job of seeing the ball into the basket. Eyes and head are up. Here, again, good footwork. He does end up on his left foot, gonna bring his right leg up, eyes and head are up, two hands on the ball as he lifts it up for the shot. Great footwork. Again, would love for these steps to be just more direct and more aggressive so that he can really lift his body up. Nothing wrong with what he's doing, but in a game situation, you've got to be really strong and aggressive, and all your movements need to be explosive. Here, again, he's, you know, I love that he would square this right shoulder here and shoot more out in front of him. He's kind of hooking it up. You could see the arm going out, the elbow out. But I like how he, you know, his release, it's come, he's got his fingers spread. He's definitely got control of the ball. So nothing terrible with that. Just to be more accurate, you want to bring it in a little tighter. Love the lift and elevation. Way to keep that arm bar up there. Nice job. Again, here he's kind of hooking it up. But again, nice lift here in elevation. He's just a natural athlete, but I think he could explode even more up if that dribble would take him to the basket more aggressively. Here you can see the follow through. He does kind of bring it around, if you will. I love the arm to be a little bit more straighter and direct. You know, he probably kind of hooked it up there, if you will. But great extension of the body, great placement of the ball on the backboard. Again, would love for him to be, you know, attack this basket more aggressively. Let's get the elbow in, have more of a follow-through extended elbow. Here the elbow's out because he's kind of hooking it up to the backboard. He's making the shot, which is good, but to take it to another level, to be more consistent, and to keep it, your body between the defender and the ball, you've got to put your body there. Here, the shooter's attempting a reverse right-hand layup, uses the dribble to set up the movement from left to right. Beautiful stride here, nice long step on the left foot. You can start to see that the foot kind of pivot in as it lands to face more of the basket. Here you start to see the right leg and knee follow. And I love how his eyes and head are up and off the dribble he puts two hands on the ball to try to bring it up to the point of release. Again, same thing here. Kind of got his hand under the ball. Let's square this right shoulder up more. But love, he's got some lift here. That's a lot better. And good arm bar bent there to act as a barrier between the ball and the defender. Again, let's be more explosive, really push off that left foot and lift the body up. He's in a really good angle here to use the backboard, eyes and head are up, two hands on the ball, and you can start to see that guide hand come off, which is what you want to see happen. And again, great footwork, great lifting of the right knee. The guide hand comes off and now it becomes, I call it an arm bar. If that's a defender, he's got his body between the defender and the ball. Great lifting of the ball for the shot. Again, love this movement here. Nice big step with the left foot followed by the right. I like the spacing he has underneath his feet. Let's get this ball up quickly. He does bring his left hand guide hand here on the ball. And I love that he knows where he is on the court. He knows where he is in relation to the basket because his eyes and head are up on the basket. uses a dribble to get himself to the basket. You know, the thing I would say with this young man is, let's have a more of explosive one dribble move. And it's okay, and I probably would be dribbling with my left hand, that dribble to my, here you've got more defenders here, but it's okay. I mean, if he feels more comfortable with his right hand, I probably would dribble it out with my left hand. And you want that dribble to be out in front of you, and he's kind of dribbling it right here beside him. So he's stepping right, and then possibly stepping left here. I love that he's not looking at the ball when he dribbles, his eyes and head are up. Here, great footwork, take off of the left foot, pulling the right knee up. He lifts the ball to his point of release with both hands and his eyes and head are on the ball.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I would encourage this dancer to really have more power through their arms and let it emulate from the back all the way to the fingertips. I would encourage the dancer to roll their shoulders forward, up and back. That makes them look more relaxed and kind of gives this element of cool to this advanced choreography. This dancer is moving super fast, so I would encourage them to spot everywhere they go so they are landing very precise. I repeat my previous comments about making sure those hips are engaged. I would encourage the dancer to move their rib cage as well as their hips their entire dance so it doesn't look like they're just moving more robotically because right now it just looks like they're moving their arms and their legs really really fast and their head really really fast but by engaging the core and the hips and the torso it creates fluidity throughout the movement.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He is able to kind of minimize that movement in his upper body and bring clarity to the arm choreography, as well as move his legs quickly and efficiently in a way that helps him embody the rhythm. As the dancer begins with a basic salsa step, step touching his feet side to side. He's got a very small movement happening in his feet and lower body and quite a lot of movement happening, particularly in the shoulders and through the arms. While I appreciate that he's able to incorporate arm choreography as well as leg choreography, his energy feels unevenly dispersed here. He needs to minimize the energy that he's putting into his upper body and bring that down to his lower body so that he is able to evenly embody the rhythm and pay attention to his movement dynamic here. As the dancer moves through a series of turns, he effectively uses his head to spot the front, which helps him to move quickly and efficiently, and he also maintains a nice bend in his knees as he's making this pivot turn happen, which helps him to stay grounded and move through the turn quickly and efficiently. As the dancer continues in this movement, he's able to locomote a little bit more through the room with clarity, particularly in his lower body. However, his upper body is still moving in a way that's distracting and throwing him off the rhythm. His shoulders have this kind of up-and-down bouncing quality to them, which doesn't quite align with the tempo or the rhythm of the music, and he's moving his arms in a fairly big manner, which is also throwing him off from the fast tempo of the music. If you were to minimize and refine the movement in his upper body, he would improve his performance.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And that's because he was keeping a firm frame between fingers 1 and 3, and then he was using his wrist and arm to then press that frame down onto the keys, and so that made it very consistent and balanced. That's well done. We need to hear all those notes in the arpeggio that was just played with both hands coming up, so just making sure that you're fully depressing the key as you're going up for every single note. Definitely some slow practice or perhaps performing at a slightly slower tempo so you have time to really get every note down. We're missing in between, in the right hand, in between these thirds that are being played, the single note in between the thirds we're not quite hearing. So just has to make sure that we don't skip over that cause that is really important both harmonically, but also for the rhythm to get the character of the rhythm. So just make sure that those notes speak. These repeated notes, the repeated D's that were just played first with finger 2 and now with finger 4, we're just not hearing them as separate notes, so we need to just have a little bit larger of a finger movement so that the key really has space to go up and down so we can really hear them. We need a little bit of a decrescendo on that descending line on the right hand. So the highest note should be the loudest, and it should decrease in volume to the lower note. We need a lot more right hand here, especially when you're competing with playing forte on low notes on the piano like he is on the left hand. We really need these high notes up here to be longer and louder, because they just don't have the same resonance as the low notes. We can see here that the pianist has completely outstretched fingers and a completely flat hand, and we can see that his fingers are basically touching the headboard of the piano. This is one of the reasons why we're not hearing enough of the right hand here, because when you're playing that far up on a black key, the lever is at its most tense point and it's hard to press down. So if he would curl his fingers a bit more and let them hang from his hand, he would then inherently be further down the black key where he would get more power out of each stroke and then we would hear more of the right hand here. Good dynamic balance between the hands right here. It's not too loud overall, which is good for a ballad like this, but we can really hear both hands clearly dynamic-wise, so it's well done. We need more clarity on these notes here, even though the pedal is down. Don't stay on the notes quite as long and give us a little bit more of a snappier finger action so we can really hear these notes. Otherwise it just ends up being what we just heard, which was just kind of a muddy sound. We need to hear more of the right hand here. Pernice is doing a great job of bringing out the higher notes in this melody in the right hand. They're kind of, musically they're sort of accented and he's accentuating that by playing them louder, so that's a nice choice. It's well done. We're hearing that the left hand is coming out very clear and very consistent and with great rhythm here. And that's because he's playing with a really nice curve to these fingers, a little bit of bend in the wrist, but generally a straight wrist. And that's allowing him to be very nimble and very controlling in that area of the piano. So that's really well done. A big lack of clarity in that riff coming from the top of the piano down to the bottom of the piano. A lot of that was because the fingers weren't curved enough, but it was also just partially coordination and not having up to speed. So we really need to hear all those notes in that fast lick. Really great soft touch here. We're hearing all the melodic notes in the right hand come with the same articulation and the same volume, so it's really well done. Left hand is really overpowering the right hand here in terms of volume, so the left hand volume is actually appropriate, we just need the right hand to be stronger here, so a little bit heavier of a touch. Excellent rhythm in this, especially right here, but for about the past minute, the rhythm has been very stable, and he's keeping the groove alive very well. So that's great. That's well done. We need a little bit less left hand here. It's overpowering the melody in the right hand On these quick and repeating B flats being played with the right hand and the second finger, we're not quite hearing all of those notes. You can tell by looking at the right hand what the rhythm is supposed to be, but we don't actually hear all of those B flats speak. Because they're quick, we need to actually have a slightly larger motion so that we can allow the key to come all the way back up, so we can press it back down all the way. What's happening is he's not allowing the key to come fully up, so he's not able to press it back down again. So a larger motion and a little bit more from the wrist would help with this, or an alternating two and three fingering on that B flat will help get us the clarity and actually hear all the notes in this rhythm. In this figure being played with fingers 2, 3, 4, we're not really hearing the note being played with finger 3, so we just need to make sure that that has a little bit snappier of a finger action so that we can really hear that 3-note gesture. We hear in these last two measures both times that the left hand has to shift from around here to further down on the piano. We have a small break in the rhythm because the pianist is not trusting his shift. So he either has to play this at a slower tempo where he can make that shift without halting the pulse of the music, or he needs to just commit to that shift and get his hand down there quicker so that we don't lose the rhythm. We lost that rhythm a little bit in the right hand. This is because there's some tension in the right hand. We can really see that through these tendons that are popping up here. And that tension makes it more difficult for the fingers to move, therefore more difficult for the fingers to be controlled. So actually having a looser right hand will allow the pianist to play faster and more controlled. In the left hand we need to hear more of the higher octave in this alternating octave pattern. If we don't hear enough of that high octave, we can't quite feel the character and the structure of this rhythm. So it just needs to bring out that first finger in the left hand a little bit more.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Big distance between the feet here. It's going to have a knock-on effect to the balance in the next touch. And then just to touch on the stance, we can see the hop here, the foot is planted heavy, causing the momentum to go forward in the upper body here. You can see the head, completely horizontal, spine very bent over, standing leg kind of straight. So again this is caused by the jump in the plant, leg coming out straight here to try to scoop the ball in before it gets beyond its target here. So what we would want to see would be the head somewhere along here, spine pretty much straight up, and then we want to see standing leg nice and bent in close to the ball, and then our right leg coming out, also with a little bit of a bend in it, and we're taking that touch in this direction, and it's followed up by just some short quick steps. One, two, three, ball is over here, and then it's just the opposite of this, where the left foot is out a little bit wider, and we're down nice and low with the knees, trying to keep our body upright so we can see what's out in front, not looking down too much, focusing on the ball and not seeing what's ahead. And again getting to this point it can look like it was pretty fluid Whatever the weave was it was I knew the other direction So it came up here and around Again can look pretty fluid but if we slow it down and we watch where the steps are being taken and The habits between the steps we can see that the technique here is Not very great Fundamentally just incorrect off balance a lot of jumping and shuffling and Needs to be fixed up a little bit Player takes a small hop on this left foot. Ideally again left foot comes across and lands here. We allow the ball to get into this area. Right foot takes a touch on the outside and both feet are stood here. So not getting this foot into the right positions with the right methods. We are jumping too much, planting too much, not light on the feet. Again it should be three steps and we go with the opposite. So right foot touch, we go left, right, left foot step and then we go with the opposite side. Here again, just seeing airborne players hovering this direction. Again, talking about three steps. Let's just simply get to this point to follow the ball while being nice and light and agile on the feet to get the touch on the ball here, to bring it through here. Same idea, three steps, hit or touch, coming across this way, one, two, three steps, right foot comes out here, and we're around. This player seems to be mixing it up. Couple of jumps here, couple of plants, couple of shuffles, couple of skips, maybe two steps. So we're just after seeing a quick shuffle of feet here and here, which can see the player allowing the ball to get past this point to this area where we want it to go. And they get an okay touch with the inside of the left foot across into this space. But what we're going to see next is this foot kind of staying planted in the ground and a big stretch of the right foot and a big stance. We're going to see this distance between both feet. It's quite a big stance where maybe what we could have seen would have been this foot being planted, a quick step with the right foot here, a quick step with the left foot here and then the right foot getting close to the ball where now we have a stance this distance apart. And it would have been because of the extra one, two, three steps here. So again, just following up from the last point, talking about the inside foot not being able to move forward until the ball has come past this line so they can step forward without kicking the ball. We see here that the player has actually taken a bit of a hop here. They wanted to bring this leg and foot forward, but they've hesitated because this ball has not moved fast enough in this direction and they can't bring this foot forward. So they're taking a hop which is affecting their balance and their stance and they're going to get stuck in the mud before their next touch where they can't really get across. So if the ball is going to end up here, they can't really get their left foot across to this point to then maneuver their right foot into this position and take a touch this way. So again, standing foot position, much closer to the ball before it is being moved across the standing foot. From here, player moving much more fluid, taking two steps because after the first touch, they are bringing their standing foot much closer to the ball to get it across here. Once again, they get it across here. Right foot will come inside a little bit. We'll get a left foot over here, taking a touch to stop the ball. Right foot then gets closer and left foot comes through here. So again, just the standing foot is the key here, getting that close to the ball to be able to kind of create an axis to lean over on. Again, once the standing foot is here, we're creating that axis to lean on again and move side to side, not being overstretched and off balance. So here again just an example of a touch and a plant. Right foot has touched the ball and planted heavy after the touch and we'll see the knock-on effect this will have. Here just a case in point, the player has actually stepped heavy with the left. They've jumped up. We can see airborne this foot in the air. Player up in the air. They're jumping across this direction to try to be planted somewhere here with their left foot to take the touch with their right foot. They're trying to redirect that ball in this direction. Instead of the jump up here to here, maybe being off balance, they will get there and they'll be able to take that touch. We talk about three steps in between. They could have taken the touch towards here. Left foot comes down, right foot comes down, left foot comes down and then right foot takes a touch in this direction. Instead of this jump here where we're airborne, putting a lot of energy into the jump, planting in this spot, we should be going one, two, three steps, touch. And then it's the same thing if we're continuing to move forward. This one is a turn so it's going to be some sort of a hook around the corner, whatever the preference is. And again just another example here of hovering in the air to try to get over to make contact with the ball before it's too late, caused again by a planted step right after a touch. And it's this action of this foot coming across To step closer to the ball That's going to cause the next touch To be good. So again, we talk about Bringing the feet closer. It always comes back to bringing the feet close If it's touchstep dribbling ahead, it's getting the foot in close to the ball So we can set our body up with good balance if it's weaving left to right It's getting our foot close to the ball before we take our touch so common theme stepping in close to the ball To again set our balance straight or to slightly lean into the touch depending on what direction we wanted to go Here we just see how the balance is going to affect our touches in the future. So the ball is being touched with the left foot as we can see here. And here, notice how far over the centre of the screen is. So the player is looking almost back towards the ball. And if we look here, foot planted, head here. So our balance way off. Out in front. And as we see in the next touch, the player is going to end up stepping on the ball to try to stabilise themselves. Again, caused from habits of not taking small steps between touches and trying to be agile. So without the player probably noticing this, they actually took 3 steps here So it's one step here, another step here and then the right foot stepped here after The touch that was in this direction and as we can see The ball is in a better position to be touched Through in this direction here I think they follow up here with another 3 steps also And they manage to navigate the ball pretty smoothly Between these areas here using many more light steps in between And having a little bit more patience whilst following the ball So we see the effects that over stretching can have here. The ball kind of gets stuck because of the width of the stance. Left foot here, right foot here, extremely wide. When the touch comes towards the ball, weight also comes down on the ball. So we can see this leg here is slanted, putting force down on the ball, ultimately causing the ball to get stuck under the foot and to cause a bit of a stumble. If again this foot comes all the way over here and is somewhere along here, that weight is leaning across this axis here and this touch is much more smooth. So here again we see the right foot planted in this space here, this space here. Zero steps between the touch from the right foot and this touch here that is happening with the left foot. So generally if I'm doing this exercise with a player I will always tell them to take three steps in between. So we will go one touch with the right. The left foot would be stepping, the right foot would come across the left foot. And now the left foot will go back outside to take a touch somewhere just across this line to move the ball in this direction. So when the left foot is touching the ball here, the right foot is close by. From there we would go right foot down, left foot here, right foot taking a touch. Around here with the left foot close by. So we now have that kind of pivot point for our body to swing over. Take that touch with the right and then we bring the right foot across. And the trend develops that way. So three steps in between. This player here is taking zero steps in between two touches. And sometimes we're going to see maybe one, two steps in between where it's not getting the body set up to get a balanced touch through to the other side. Again starting off with a one touch Planted foot here and this left foot coming around to meet the ball Without any other steps being taken in between both touches. So again balance is off Not set up to move across in this direction on this next touch in the right way So again player just needs to take more steps in between So here, just again to show the off-balance habits that are creating these issues. Bulk of the weight here, head here, so it's a big lean forward, ball getting stuck under the feet, very heavy plant, and kind of a higher center of gravity. So again we want to see the center of gravity pulled back, lowered a little bit here, and us standing slightly behind the ball but close to it, legs slightly bent, body upright, head tilted not as low, we're here, we can lean in that direction and take a touch through the ball over here. In this exercise here we are looking at dribbling. It looks like the player is dribbling in a manner which is seeing them weave in and out through the cones and assuming back this way and back around at the top. So we will look at the same things as usual, how fluid the ball is moving through these cones, the different surfaces that the player is using of their foot, the technique involved, the stance they are using, the step in, centre of gravity, stuff like that. The speed of the ball, tempo of the touches, repetitive and challenging sequences if there are any, steps between the touches, how the steps are being taken, the distance that is being covered per second and then any creativity that the player may be exhibiting in this video. And again here, just the player again airborne. See the leg up here, this one kind of slanted back underneath. And the player's hovering across to try get themselves in the right position to use the inside of the foot through the gap. So just extra steps needed in between the touches. Not sure whether it's experience or habit, bit of both, lack of experience maybe, not sure. So this is one that I do with players and it's always touch, three steps in between minimum, touch, three steps in between minimum and the player staying close to the ball and eventually they get very controlled with this one. So this foot should kind of be here already. So right foot which is about here should be here when this touch is taken. This left foot can come across and in front and land somewhere here. Then right foot can come back to about this position. Left foot takes another step standing here and the right foot swings around to meet the ball somewhere around here. We take that touch there and it's through. But again feet just not being set in the right position. And if we're wondering why it looks more fluid and Looks like the player is a better dribbler When they're actually taking two touches either side So we've got two touches here two here Two here to get through and then this is our second touch here to bring it through this direction Why is this a successful touch? We look at the standing foot We can see ball touching foot Standing foot behind here. The player is leaning in this direction and Then they're following it up With probably an over stretched foot to stop the ball in this area But what is going to happen is if this is a right foot and they stop the ball with the impact They bring the left foot over here Kind of creating that line this axis here on which they're then leaning across and they're taking a second touch with the right foot in this direction while leaning over and Again the idea we talked about three steps is to get the feet closer together to take these touches to lean into them And That is why it looks better all of a sudden, but there are more touches being taken So it's obviously easier to do when we take more touches so more touches lower level and But also setting themselves up for success Just with the position of the feet being much closer Again, just following up from the last one, we can see the foot still planted from that last touch which took the ball over here. What would have helped again this player would have been if this right foot here had taken a quick shuffle step here, plant the left foot in front while lifting the right foot to then bring the right foot here to take that touch across. See, when we look at this exercise in 1x speed or above, we might think that the ball is moving pretty fluidly through, which there's an argument that it is, but then if you actually slow it down to 0.5 or 0.25, you will notice more how many inconsistencies there are with the technique here, and the stepping, the shuffling, the balance being off, and just many different types of jumps and off-balance touches that are behind the movement of that ball. So, you could again argue this ball is moving through fluidly, but talk about overall dribbling ability here, it's not quite a sustainable style of dribbling, a lot of erratic jumping just to get to the right positions, without kind of having the right foundation or fundamentals in the stepping, and why we are getting from one place to another, what manner, what way, what shape do we want to be in when we get there. And now that foot has come down, it's quite planted here. So that's the one that was bearing all the weight. We see the ball has not really cleared past this point yet. We want to get it into this space somewhere. So we can take that touch, clear the cone diagonally. It's not getting past, but the player has had to ground their feet. Their right foot, because they are off balance. They are stuck in the mud back here. Weight is now moving towards this way. They have had to ground prematurely because they are not moving their feet fast enough. And they are electing to use always the foot that is closer to the outside of the centre line. So they are using the left foot when it's on the left, and then they are using the right foot when it's on the right. So on the last weave We've kind of had the player resorting to taking two touches on each side Not sure if it's because they're Unsure of how to get over there on time Don't quite know the answer to get across which is just taking shorter faster steps whether there or whether they are lower on energy not sure but Yeah, not not as fluid and not as high quality Quality probably dropping if anything So early on, based on getting from here down to here and back and we're up to this point here we see that the player is electing to use the inside of their foot the most. We're seeing inside of the foot or on this side, inside here. The player is using that to move the ball kind of forward and or across. Maybe a touch forward, maybe a touch across with the inside. The obstacles that are going to get in the way here being the outside foot, not the outside of the foot, but the outside foot. So they're always using, if this is our right and this is our left, they're always using the outside foot to push across the body. When it gets here, we're going to inside foot, outside foot would be the right foot this time. They're using the right foot to get across the body here. What the obstacle is here is this foot wants to move and take a step, but they have to wait until the ball gets past this point before they can take that step forward, which is going to cause the player to have to pause in their stepping and potentially plant their feet and it's going to affect the fluidity in the ball, the speed. The stance, the balance, many things will be affected if they keep trying to use the inside of the foot and kind of remain in such an upright stance with no lowering of the center of gravity, no bending the hips here, no bending the knee. So we'll see how it plays out, but early signs of this one is going to be a bit sticky.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This is improper technique in the left hand over here. What we see is that the wrist is very dropped and we can see that the top of the palm is actually touching the keys. We never want that to happen. Even if we're playing notes that are seemingly easy, we wanna be prepared for anything. And so keeping our wrist straight with our arm is gonna be preferable there. And then also that's gonna give us the most control over the articulation, the sound of these notes. So bring that wrist up a little bit and that's gonna help a lot. A little bit more crescendo in the bass line here, the notes being played with the fifth finger of the left hand. A little bit more of a crescendo and decrescendo in this last gesture that was played in the right hand just for musical expression to make it more exciting. In the left hand, we have to hear a little bit more of the third that's being played of the three notes, so the middle note that's being played, just a little bit more so we can really get the harmony here. This figure that was just played, this slightly ornamental figure that was just played with the right hand, can be brought out a bit more. It has to be a bit more of an accented feeling as opposed to one long melodic line. So just bring that out a tad bit more. This is great positioning of the right hand. We see that the top of the hand is in line with the forearm. The fingers are naturally hanging down from the hand and there's plenty of room underneath the hand for the thumb to cross underneath it. So that's great positioning. Great technique. A little bit more decrescendo in the past five beats would be most musically appropriate. We need a little bit more articulation here So a little bit heavier of a touch But a little bit shorter of a note length if possible in the left hand just so the left hand doesn't ring and overpower the right The pianist is doing a really good job of keeping a stable pulse, even at a slow tempo with a melody that is rhythmically sparse. They're doing a very good job of keeping the pulse. It's well done. One great thing that we noticed with the left hand and these last couple beats that were played is that the left hand is barely coming off of the piano. It's staying very close to the piano. And this is what is allowing the pianist to play this difficult passage where there's a shift in every beat very smoothly because they're being very efficient about their movement. So it's very well done. Excellent balance between the right and left hand here. Also excellent sensitivity to touch here. She is getting a very warm and round sound out of the piano. It's very well done. We're hearing a little bit of a lack of coordination between fingers 1 and 3 in the left hand. We're hearing the finger 1 play the note slightly sooner than finger 3. So we just need to make sure that the frame that we have set up to play that chord is accurately set up so that both notes go down at the same time. This section right here that she's just beginning should be a lot softer. It's the same dynamic as the section that she just finished. We should make a contrasting musical statement here, so a little bit softer here. We like to see a little bit in the past three beats of the piano played, a little bit more of a crescendo just to bring out that moving bass line. The wearer is sitting slightly too far back from the piano. We see that the arm only has a little bit of bend in it here. We'd like to see just a tad bit more bend because in this position, if the pianist had to move to the top end or the bottom end of the piano, it would be pretty difficult because their arms would be very outstretched. So sit a little bit more leaning forward, a little bit more forward on the seat, a little bit more bend in the arm, and that's going to make a lot more of the piano available to you. Very well done with that lowest note just played with the left hand here. Excellent sensitive touch, just a very ethereal feeling created by that light touch of this low note. Well done. In the right hand here, we have a little bit of uncoordination in these thirds being played. We're missing a little bit of the bottom note of those thirds. So bring that out just a tiny bit so we can really hear the full harmony. Nice balance here between the left hand and the right hand. The right hand has the melody and the wearer is bringing that out and letting the left hand accompany. So that's well done.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here we have the Climber 1 move in on this boulder, and you can get a pretty good look at what this hold is like. It's basically shaped like a telephone, so it's like this. You can get all the way around it. This is the wall, which is kind of cool. It's also pretty fat, so you do have to pinch it. It's an interesting hold.

This is called flagging out and it transfers over the weight to the left foot being in place. However, when the climber pushes into that left foot towards the hold, not only gave him direction, but also when being pressed, it sends the climber's center of gravity away from the wall. So right now the climber is glancing down at the feet to perform a foot switch. The climber performs the next move by sending the right hand over the left hand, both with the hands on the same holder. This is called matching and places the hand not only above but mostly to try to pinch the inside of the hold, left side part of the lip. So the climber is using his thumb that's placed on the outside and the fingers on the inside to pinch onto the lip. While keeping the left foot out of space and towards the wall, not placing any footholds and instead has pressed down onto the right foot so that he can try to keep his center of gravity underneath his left hand grip to make it an easy transition out left. The climbers right foot had slipped off from the hold while adjusting the grip. This is potentially due to a lack of accuracy on the foot placement and a mix of the climber potentially not applying sufficient pressure onto the right foot when releasing some pressure of the grip to adjust it. If he was to attempt this again he needs to make sure that he keeps the flag forcefully to help with the pressure of the right foot being in place. As the climber had made the right foot placement, he is adjusting the right hand grip, jumping over the hand placement, his right foot has come out of place. This obviously will compromise the grips by overloading them and will be really hard for him to recover at this move. The climbers are starting at a two-hand hold start. For the right hand, he's applying a pinch grip as he places the fingers onto one side and the thumb onto the other. And for the application for it, he would have to squeeze onto the hold and pull it back. For the left hand and the other hand, he is sustaining to a very small hold, placing the finger pads over the hold. This is type of a knob-like that is shallow, so he is actually using the thumb onto the one side to close the grip. This type of grip is called a crimp, and in this case, this would be an open crimp because he places the finger onto the side. And in order to create pressure in sustaining it, the climber must keep the elbow close to the wall. The climbers are starting at a sit start, so he is placing right now the right foot at a higher stance, and as soon as he gets himself positioned to transfer over the weight to the feet and to the grips, he will then lift the left foot from the mat, and then the climb will start. The clamberhack lands down at the feet and applies a foot switching technique that's called the jump off jump on where he jumps off the left foot while the right foot is hovering over it and then jumps the right toe to be placed over the hold. This method of foot switching works but is also not the most accurate as it takes a fair bit of energy and if that foothold is small it would be hard to do this and this is a medium-sized hold. Before the climb we're glancing over to the next hold at reach. He has brought the left foot to be placed over the orange hold left side. He will use this to push it over to bring him over to the left side when performing the reach. The climbers first move out of the start as into this large pocket. As we can see, the climber places only a few fingers over the edge of the hold. As there is a hole inside of the hold that is sharp, the climber must place the fingers behind the edge of the hold. That's the only way that it seems to be positive. It was a good idea of the climber to keep the right hand on the hold as this one is a pinch and the climber can bring the elbow out comparatively from the crimp. That is a very limited hold to sustain. As we can see the climber's form, he had press on the right foot that gave him height. For balance, the move was done by the left foot which was out in space and brought towards the wall with the leg extended. This type of form is called flagging out. When the climber was going out for the reach, the climber sends the left foot over to the right side. This is to balance over his main areas of support and to bring the center of gravity close to the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The climber attempts to go up to this green pinch, but as the climber grabs it, they start to accelerate to the left. So in a sense, this pinch sort of takes the climber, is how we would say it, and they're just unable to control this.

If they were indeed turning in partner, they would have to have strength through their core and throughout their arm to be able to whip their partner around. Sometimes what dancers do is they actually just hold onto the finger while this imaginary person kind of twirls around them. But in order to do that, the partner has to have, or the stationary partner has to have, or the partner that's not turning has to have strength and power to be able to twirl the partner. So I would encourage them to really kind of be statuesque in their upper body while they're moving side to side in their lower body. I would encourage this dancer to have more attack in their movement. This would help them stay on the rhythm. Right now they're kind of lightly stepping while they're touching. Like it's like step, step, step, touch, step, step, step, touch. If they had more attack, it would allow them to stay on the rhythm, right? Because they can't get lost in the ebb and flow of the melody. They would have to be forced to be on the beat. That step, step, step, touch, step, step, step, touch. Really having attack in their movement and precision. Here I will repeat all my previous comments for this last chunk. I would encourage the dancer to study the music. Right now they're off of the rhythm, and which is causing them to not appear to have musicality. So really taking the time to study the rhythm and making sure they're on the beat is super important. I would encourage the dancer to think about what part of their foot they're turning on. Is it the ball of the foot? Is it the whole foot? Is it the heel of the foot? I'm going to assume it's the ball of the foot. So really stepping, like grinding into that ball of the foot to be able to turn on this axis is really important and will create a more seamless, smooth transition. I would encourage the dancer to stabilize their upper body. So thinking about splitting their body in half, right, from the crown of their head all the way down to their tailbone, splitting it and really holding space and holding that upper body torso still while they solidified the feet. And then as they get more advanced, they can start to incorporate the torso. Right now everything is kind of loosey-goosey and kind of just vibing while the feet are on the beat. And it messes up the musicality of this movement. So really holding stable and as they practice and get better at attacking and having musicality and being on beat in the feet, then they can slowly add in the shoulders and the head and the ribcage and then the hips. At this moment, the dancer has musicality and rhythm in their feet, like they're on the beat for the step, step, step, touch, step, step, step, touch, or step, touch, step, touch, right? But their shoulders and their head and their hips are not, or their arms are not on the beat. So having musicality from the tippy top of your head all the way to the soles of your feet are important. And just takes it to that, gives it more dynamic quality and really covers the basics of this salsa step.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

If the dancer had a partner in front of them and they were in unison and dancing in sync, they would be wanting to look at the partner in front of them. Greater clarity on where the steps are going for the dancer would be very helpful. And again, it almost seems like the dancer is wandering where the dancer's head is shifting here and back again. It's unclear what the dancer's choreography or their movement is specifically. Right here, you can see the dancer has the body going this way versus this way. So there needs to be a little bit more break and release in the hips and less breaking in the neck and the head. The head should be a little bit more connected to the shoulders here. Also, the dancer can step together. So if they step right, left, right, and they take that step way over left, right, left. So it feels like there's two sets of three steps, right, left, right, left, right, left, right. So right, left, right, left, right, left, versus them just stepping, stepping, stepping, stepping. We don't see a variation when the dancer goes from the right to the left. So we want to see isolation here in the waist and the hips, the feet and the upper body. We don't want to see this connected as one piece moving the same way. So if the dancer has the ability to isolate that rib cage and that upper torso, move it independently of the waist so we could see the hips versus the legs moving the hips, it should be the hips moving themselves and the waist moving itself.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And when his hips are the closest to the wall, then focus on jumping up and to the right. So it looks like he's got the height, jumping in properly, that if he combines the proper position with this power, he should be able to hit it.

This was because the climber had engaged the right foot prematurely at the jump, destroying his center of gravity away from the wall. Here the climber is now committed and is executing the jump. He does this by pressing hard on the foot that was against the wall. And as we can see the leg is now extended because it's no longer touching the wall. The climber had to sprint out of this leg and soon placing weight onto the highest foot. As the climber is gaining height, once the chest meets the same height of where the hands are, the climber will have to commit into a forceful pull. This so that the climber can bring the chest towards the wall. That will help the climber to stay close to the wall and going in the direction where the hold is at reach. As we can see the climber continues to look at the hold to aim exactly at where he would go for the reach. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start. As we can see, they're both rounded, so with a hole inside, this is called a donut. And the climber places the hand in the inside of the hole and presses the thumb on the outside to create more force on the grip. As the climber has secured the grip, he then leans back on the holds and the climb will start until the climber places the feet on the wall, which he's already on that stance. The left foot is pressed against the wall and the right foot is placed on a hold that the climber is able to place the front, the toe box sole area against the surface of the hold as it sticks out and the climber is able to press comfortably on it. As we can see, the climber is glancing over to a hold that is at distance. This, the climber will have to commit to a dynamic move where he needs to jump in order to achieve it. This is called the dino. The climber needs to make sure that he brings his chest as close as he can to the wall when making the jump. This will help the climber bring his center of gravity close to the wall, which lays in the core and on the hips area. And once the climber needs to commit on pushing on the right foot, then he will be able to boost that with not pushing himself away from the wall. So the engagement of the boost on the right foot is important that it's done at the right time and not done prematurely. As we can see, it took the climber's center of gravity away from the wall and did not let the climber apply any gripping power when making the dyno. As the climber was gaining height, the climber then pressed on the right foot to boost the jump. And as pressing the foot, the climber now has pushed it earlier. As we can see, the climber's center of gravity is being taken away from the wall when at the reach. The climber was able to make the hand placement, and on this one, he's able to hold it on as a jug, where he's going for a pinch at the lip. By placing the thumb at the bottom of the hold, and the fingers are placed above. This is important that the climber, once reaching the hold, he creates a lot of pressure by pinching it. And as we can see, the climber is also sending the left hand to create more support when at the grip. As we can see, the climber is swinging left to right. This is so that the climber is able to build momentum right before committing to the jump. So, it's important that the climber during this time is continuing to look at the hold to make sure that he doesn't miss the area where he aims to make the placement of the hand when making the reach.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They could just slightly speed it up a little bit more so both the strings sound better. There's more resistance in the bow since they're playing two strings. The violist often plays at the tip for a lot of these sections. Sometimes it's appropriate, but during this section I feel like they could use more of their lower amount of bow closer to the frog. The reason I feel like they're not doing this is because they're not utilizing their upper arm. They can bring it closer to their body to help get closer to the frog. Again, whenever the violist is lifting up their fingers, they're getting really far away from the fingerboard. They can lift them up but still be closer without actually having them touch. This pulsating stroke that they're doing to the bow, they're doing a good job of using their first finger to kind of flex the stick so they're getting this pulse in the string without actually leaving the string. The violins could use their upper arm to bring closer to their body so that they could play more at the frog of the bow. The violins perform a trill where they are rapidly going between two notes in the left hand. These notes that they're playing are a bit out of tune. They can try playing with a tuner, or they can play these notes and play it with an open string to get more context about the intonation. Again, this section would sound a little bit better if they were closer to the frog. They would have more control from their hand and their arm. The violinist plays two strings at once to play this chord. These single notes that the spineless is playing could be a little bit more compact using less bow for them to stick out a little bit more. The violinist is using a lot of bow and playing this really nice legato stroke. The violinist is playing some more string crossings. I feel like they could be even more efficient and have clear string crossings if they make more use of opening up their elbow. So the string crossings come from just opening up the elbow as they're playing. Again, you can see how far the fingers are going away from the fingerboard. It's best, even if they're not playing them, to try to keep it as close as possible to be as efficient as possible. The violins is playing out in the tip of the bow for this section to get a lighter sound. To get more articulation out of each note though, they can pronate more with their right hand, putting more weight into their first finger into the bow. Again, this is another example where the violence is not utilizing this part of the bow. They're not bringing in their upper arm enough to be able to get close to that section. The violinist is performing some slurs where they're playing two notes in a row in the same bow. Again, their left hand, whenever they have a finger down, the lower finger is also always up. This will create more tension in the hand. It's best to have a more efficient hand that the fingers are always closer to the fingerboard. In the violinist's bow hold, you can see that their thumb is very straight here. They should overall have a very curved thumb with a very soft touch contact with the frog. These repeated notes that they're playing on the bow sound pretty good, but I think it could be better if they were just a little bit further down to the frog. Again, they're doing this trill in the left hand with repeated fast notes between two fingers. The violins perform some string crossings very well, moving from one string to another. The violinist is using a small amount of bow and not much weight to create this very light sound. The violinist is getting some really nice clarity in the left hand because they're playing with their fingertip and using a nice amount of speed to get into the string. When playing with their left hand, you can see that their fingers are getting really high up off the string. To be the most efficient, they should try to keep them as close to the string as possible.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It's aggressive, it's explosive. Not little teeny little steps. Great vision here. Two hands on the ball as he pulls the shot up. Again, same thing here, big step here with the left foot. He actually is not dribbling at all. He's just choosing, and this is how I would really want people to learn how to shoot. It's just no dribble. Just have the ball in your hands, two hands, take a big step with that left foot and pull that right knee up. See this, two hands, eyes are up, one big step with the left foot, pull the right knee forward and up. Here's the continuation, just lets that ball flick right off those fingertips, does a great job of lifting off the ground, keeping his eye on his target, love the arm bar out extended, helping the guard against any defenders coming across his body to get the ball. Here he, there's no dribble, but does a good job of planning that left, chooses to bring the right leg up and power it up off two feet. Again, he kind of shoots it over his right shoulder, but for his size, I call this a baby hook. Look at the flick of the wrist here. And, you know, the ball's right on target to hit the top of the square, go through the net. Here's the lift, his eyes stay up, great push off here, he's starting to pull that right leg and knee, see how he takes it up here with two hands, nice job. Here's the baby hook, just beautiful extension here, good control, lift off that left foot, pulling that right leg up and squaring his body. Nice look. Here he chooses, this is nice, I wanted to show you this. He's not using the backboard, but here's a guy with his size and length and strength and skill. You know, he's just laying that thing right over the rim. Not a lot of people can do that. Beautiful lift, powering it up. Beautiful extension of the body. It's vertical, it's not falling right, left, or backwards. Look how the ball comes off those fingers. Nice job over the rim. Takes a big old step with that left foot, following with the right knee. Eyes are on target. Look how he's got two hands on the ball to give it really good support and control as you lift it into your shot. But he's stepping where he needs to step to push off and get the angle to use the backboard. This is a really nice look here. Very athletic, skilled. He's got some lift, really pulling that right knee up, using that left foot to push off and square his body. Love how he's got his arm bar up. If there's a defender on this side, he's got this arm between the ball and the defender. Great vision, great lift and extension here. Nice job. Here the shooter is going from the left side to the right side to shoot a reverse right hand layup. Great job getting it off the dribble here, getting the ball in two hands. That right hand is behind the ball, that off left guide non-shooting hand comes up to help lift the ball up. Beautiful step here with the left foot where he's gonna really do a great job of pushing off here. Here, here he's beginning to lift it, but see how there's two hands on the ball. Much better control. It's a strong basketball move. Pushing off that left foot. See that right knee come up. Nice job. Again, push off the left, right knee pulled up, but then he lands square to the baseline to the basket. Beautiful extension here of the right shooting arm. Look at the fingers. Nice job. Here's the finish. Comes down with a good staggered stance. Ball's coming off the backboard. His eyes and head are up. If that ball comes off, he's in a position here to get the rebound. Here's this big step, pulling that right knee, two hands on the basketball. Again, beautiful push off of the left foot. He's pulling that right knee up. Going back, he's using this left foot to move his body and to get it more facing the baseline or the basket. But look at this offhand. It's at 90 degree. He's got his shooting hand here behind the ball. Great length here. Very much of a great example of body control and skill. Here's the push-off on the left foot and the drawing of the right knee. He uses that left foot to plant, to push off, to lift, to elevate, but also to square his body to the baseline or to the basket. He's a big guy, so he kind of shoots what I call a little baby hook shot. It's not a full hook shot, but he has such great size, length, skill that he can just kind of shoot it up over, you know, like a, it's almost like a hook shot, but it's a little semi hook shot.

Correct thing to do, just place the bow on the string silently, gently, then add the weight in, then move the bow. We hear a stuttering in the sound at the beginning of this note. That's because the violist came down from too high when placing the hair on the string and didn't have control of the bow, so then the bow bounced against the string. The correct thing to do would be to lightly place the bow on the string in a way where it's not going to have any vertical bounce or horizontal motion so that we don't get any sound until we intentionally pull the first note. We hear a bit of an airy and scratchy sound on these shorter notes that were played in the upper third of the bow. This is because there was not a correct amount of weight. There was too little weight in the bow, and so the scratching came from gliding on top of the string as well as the bow moving up and down, meaning toward the fingerboard and toward the bridge. Ideally, we would want to have enough weight in to where we had great contact with the string, and that great contact would also prevent the bow from leaving that groove that it's in, and then we would just get clear tone. So what the violists should do here is just add in a little bit of weight through their first finger, so the weight of the arm going into the first finger, and then that will transfer it up into this section of the bow and we'll get a clearer sound.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It should be in a straight line, but instead it's curved with her fingertips pointing straight ahead and not on the diagonal. The dancer could be crossing her foot further behind and have help with that if she was to bend her left knee. Bending that leg would help her move it behind her right foot. What you should do instead was rotate the turn a little bit further So that her whole body is facing the front of the room right now. She's still on a slight diagonal Which is why the camera is in view And so if she would have rotated her turn a bit more clockwise to face the front Then when she extended her left leg out It would have been to a true down a true horizontal and then her both right and left left leg would have been on the same plane as each other The reason why her left foot is behind her right foot is because she under rotates her turn And brings her left foot out a bit too soon The dancer is doing a good job of moving her arms to an extreme, both up and down. However, that's the extent of it. It's just the extremities of her limbs moving. And instead, she should also be moving her shoulders, so that her arms are moving as a result of her shoulders moving, and they're moving together, not just her arms independently.

From this moment, looking at the previous movement of the dancer, I think they could even engage their hips and move their hips even more in this moment and really tap that foot and use that ball of the foot to help swivel those hips even bigger. This would again create a more dynamic quality that takes it to that professional level. I just want to point out the great details in this moment. Think about all the way the movement of the hand and the flick of the wrist, all the way throughout their fingertips, and the rolling of the shoulders, and the rolling of the elbows all the way up, while you're having this foot articulation, and this slight hip lift, hip thrust, while they tap their feet. So they're having multiple body rhythms, or holding several movements in their body at once, or several rhythms in their body at once, which is a difficult thing to do. I really appreciate this dancer's engagement with their head. They incorporate every part of their body all the way from their feet to their head. Even their arms and hands are moving in this position. And you can see what we call an undulation, or basically a body roll from the top of the head all the way down through the tailbone. So this is a great example of an undulation in this basic salsa. I would encourage this dancer to think about focus, where is their head, and being intentional about where their head is going. Again, keeping that energy consistent throughout, thinking about how to have more plie in their movement and sending those hips back to have greater range of motion. To improve this movement, the dancers doing a great job of using their arms as an anchor. But to again improve this movement, I would snap that head around even faster. I would spot even faster to be able to turn even quicker and with more precision. I think that this dancer can take even bigger steps to create a more dramatic, dynamic quality and really move on this pendulum with their hips. And they would do that, of course, by bending their legs or having more plie and sending that this tailbone back. And then of course, engaging those arms through the back to make the sweeping motion. So all these things working together basically creates not only just a more dynamic quality, a more dramatic look and feel. So this dance, but also takes it to that professional level.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And it will free up his right arm to do what he needs to do. So it's going to take all that tension of his right arm and really take all the body weight and let him move up through it. So still kind of getting all bunched up and doing this foot swap while hand foot matching here when he could be doing it a little bit lower. This would kind of just save him from having to get so bunched up. He could kind of stay closer to the wall and not have to fight it so much in his core. And he's almost kind of back-legging, but he's still got the helican. This left foot's kind of hanging out down below, staying nice and rigid, keeping them balanced. So that way he can kind of match on this pinch and with his left hand out to the sloper. Now this time he kind of just matches on this right side and goes immediately up to the pinch, the bad pinch. So he kind of skips this intermediate on the left side so it looks like the sequence might feel a little bit better. And it kind of keeps him a little bit higher, like on a little bit better hold that he can pull straight down on.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

You want to be able to keep that flexion in your knees. That way you can be mobile to be able to transition into the next position. Right here, the ball seems to be off his guy hand a little bit soon. You may want to keep it on there a tad bit longer. The follow through is going straight up.

However, the climber had let go of the right hand to go up further in the reach and in this case he wasn't able to engage a powerful enough move to step up over the right foot. So the climber instead of going with the hand up, had tried to cut himself by holding again to the hold that is matching with the foot. It's important that the climber glances over where the foot positioning is, especially if he's making a foot swap. So the climber in this time is holding on tightly to the jug. This being a positive one, the climber can comfortably rely on the grip while extending the arms to have a better view of the foot positioning. It's important that the climber does the foot hop in and hop out to place the right part of the foot, and this one being the toe to the foot chip below. And place it securely as he would need it to move up onto the next hold. Here we can see the clamber bringing the right foot next to the left hand, both being in the same hold. This is called a match, when both limbs are in the same hold. Here we can see the climber how he has immediately send the hand down to go back into the same position but the right heel did not create enough pressure for the stance and instead has it slipped off from the edge. Trying to release a heel hook usually can be hard to recover as when coming off because the heel hooks need to be released intentionally for any climber and so him using already the foot which is one of the main parts for the base of support has the climber at this moment not be able to sustain the fall. Here we can see the climber rocking himself back and forth. This so that the climber can gain momentum in the moment he needs to step up over the right heel. That is the one being in place next to the hand that right hand has been placed. Now in this moment where the climber was going to go and stand up over the heel, he didn't bring himself to a pull powerful enough and instead of going up for the hold above, he has missed going out for the reach. In this moment he is peeling off the wall due to only having two points of contact on the wall but mostly because he wasn't able to apply the weight over the foot that is placed the highest. Here we can see the climber palming down, meaning walking down, the right hand to the left side of the hold. This to give space for the foot to take placement next to the hand. This is called matching when both hand and foot are placed on the same hold. Now as we can see, the right foot has gone up with the heel being placed on top of the hold, where the climber will rock the heel inside of behind the edge. This is called a heel hook. So the climber will be rolling their heel from the outside to the back of the heel to get it stuck behind the hold. And then the toe will be going up to secure the position of the heel hook behind the edge. Here we can see the climber starting at a two hold start. This one, each hand having its own hold, are bow jugs. In this case the right hand as we can see is placed with the hold being slightly sideways with the entryway on to the left side of that hold. Due to this twist Now that the climber has moved out left to the pinch, he has before then pivoted his left toe to go onto the outer edge of that toe box and brought the left leg with the knee pointing inwards, this to help the climber to keep the left side close to the wall to help with the reach out left. Now that the climber was able to secure that right foot, the climber then lets go of the left foot. This then step up on the right foot that's being placed the highest to drive the hips and to gain leverage. As soon as the climber brings their center of gravity at a higher stance, the climber then can quickly remove the left hand to make a placement out to join the hand above. Here the climbers are starting at a two-hold start, each hand holding onto a jug, which the top one is slightly placed sideways, where the climber will have to engage the outer part of the palm to create pressure. It has a positive grip, meaning that a hole behind it and the climber has comfortably wrapped a hand around the edge, helps the climber to endure this grip for quite some time and lean comfortably back by placing force onto that grip. Now the climber with the other hand, being the left one, is also a jug, but this time is opening is onto the side and so the climber wraps the hands from the outside in. So the climber must pull on that hold slightly upwards and inwards. As the climber holds onto the holds tight, must bring the feet up onto the wall and the hips then will have to be, the weight that is carried on from the hips, the climber then will transfer it down to the foot that are positioned below. When the climber is off the mat, then the climber starts.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I will also repeat my previous comments about having power and strength throughout the arms. I would encourage the dancer to be more grounded. Notice how this leg is very straight and this one is very bent. I would encourage them both to be bent and then maybe one leg could be more bent than the other. Also to send those hips back so they have more range of motion. I repeat comments I made in previous video about spotting and making sure you whip that head around quickly. Here I'll repeat my previous comments about grounding, but also making sure to have that hip articulation. I would encourage this dancer to really think about this arm here.

It just feels really like she's breathing and she's taking her time and really connecting with the like lyrical flow of the music. So really nice job just keeping the movements very mellow and simple but still accurate. So here she steps forward. She's kind of sliding her feet on the floor so I definitely think she can go more on the balls of her feet to step out and do the twist so it's very clear step step step as well as twisting her knees out to the side when she twists and walks. So here she does a bit of a body roll. I think she can definitely open her legs out a bit more just to be a little more grounded in the movement as well as bending her knees more so that way the roll is coming from the bottom up and not just her upper body doing all the work. And through to the end, same thing as before, just really nice fluid movements and really finding the lyrical notes of the music and connecting with that. So really beautiful work. So here, watching her body is just really nice and wavy as she does this step. So really beautiful work there. So here with the arms, definitely want to extend those arms out as they go around so they're not bent or being cut off in the movement. So in the first couple counts, she does a really great job hitting every step, keeping her movements nice and light, keeping her knees bent throughout the movements, as well as using the space well. So really nice job in the opening. So here, just a stance concern, I think she can open her legs out a bit more, again, to have a bit more groundedness to her movement. So if her feet are out, then her knees will be a little more bent, and then she can really roll that head all the way around, down and up below her shoulders. So here I felt like this part was a bit rushed in the step into this like lunging moment with the leg extended out and then her left arm reaching down and around. I think if she took her time up like take a half a second maybe a whole count more it really could have allowed her to really brush the floor with her arm for a little bit longer. So here as she turned around in each direction, I really like that her movements are really smooth and consistent in their energy level so she's not forcing anything, but she's able to hit each step correctly and on the correct beat and all of the accents.

I think it would benefit more by squaring that, you know, left foot and those hips more to the basket, be more sideways. Let's extend the shooting arm. It's kind of going across the basket instead of to the basket. Let's get that follow through, following the ball to the backboard. Great elevation of the left arm, much better follow through here with that arm, that shooting left hand arm following the ball to the basket. Great lifting of the hips, elevation off the balls of the feet. Again, keep that ball up high. I love that it ends up in two hands. As you get balanced and gather yourself to go back up again, knees are bent. Again, would benefit be more effective if it was more of a step through, a one-two step and up. This person's just choosing to go from side to side with a two-foot takeoff. But again, as he transitions from the right, the left side, lets the ball come out of the rim and drop, becomes very vulnerable. This drill is meant to be a rebound and drill, keeping those hands and eyes up. But love how he bends his knees as he prepares to go up. But let's keep this ball up high. You're going to be definitely more effective and more successful. Here he lets it drop really a little bit too low, but love that he's been in his knees ready to jump, eyes and head are up. Again, drops that left shoulder, therefore drops the ball. Let's keep it up high. But I love the fact that he never loses sight of where he wants to go with the basketball. He's not having to look down at the ball at all. Nice job. Again, good lift here off two feet, raising of the hips. Nice touch here with the left hand. That guide hand is bent, comes off to add some support there and kind of be between the ball and the defense. Nice job. Again, not real good footwork here. It's effective, I will say. I mean, it's not the, probably the way the micin' is meant to be. It's more of a step through and elevate off one foot, but some people find it as they're learning to go off two feet, but great positioning here with that shooting hand behind the ball. The guide hand is adding support. You can see it here as the person attempts to shot that left hand guide hands. They are to offer a little token pressure, but will come off for the shot. Here the shooter is shooting, doing the Mike and drill going from right to left side. He is choosing to go off two feet and just kind of move side to side, if you will, is effective that way, shooting with the correct hand on both sides. The extension of the left hand on the shooting side might work on the spacing a little bit here, maybe a little bit too close to the rim, but nice job. Again, great lift and extension here. I love the guide hand here on the side. Great extension of the right arm as the shot leaves the hand. Again, love the lift, extension of the body, great positioning and angle here. That ball's leaving the left hand. We got a little space here in cushioning, the ball's sitting on the pads of the fingers. I love that the arm bar is bent at 90 degree, eyes and head are up. This is a really good look here. Again, kind of short arms adhere instead of extending that shooting right elbow to the rim. Would love to see some lift and elevation here. I love that his arm bar is bent and there to add protection from the defense. Love that his arms and hands are up as he makes his way to the left from the left to the right side but again would be definitely be more effective in this drill if he would time his movement by stepping through and lifting and elevating.

So here you have the climber attempting to do this cross and just comes up short. I have a feeling that the way to start this boulder is left hand here and then right hand on the pinch and just simply bearing down on this left hand crimp and doing this cross because the right foot is quite good so all the ingredients are there for this move.

So that means their back, their torso, their hips, all of that movement and making sure they breathe throughout that movement. Another thing I would encourage the dancer to think about is texturing of the movement. So what movement should be soft versus what movement should be hard, especially because this is labeled advanced choreography. Right? Not all movements should look exactly the same. The dancer does a really good job of doing these staccato movements. I would again encourage them to think about their hip articulation throughout it and how can they incorporate their head in the movement to keep the flow and energy and overall dynamic quality engaged without it looking awkward. I would encourage the dancer to engage their shoulders and use their torso as an extension of their arms to create more fluidity throughout the movement. I think the dancer should also think about making sure that they are grounded throughout their movement. So sending, making sure they plie, but also sending those hips back a bit creates more range of motion. So they're not trying to, the dancer is not trying to push through a small axis to work through while they're dancing. Instead, if they're in this kind of bended motion, they have a greater range of motion to be able to circle their hips or move their legs or rotate their arm or circulate that torso. When you're working from a straight kind of pencil like movement, it's hard to be able to articulate and have that same type of flow. I would encourage a dancer to be more grounded in their movement and to really think about flow and musicality because some of their movement can sometimes look awkward.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Overall, I would encourage the dancer to have more attack throughout their movement, which would increase the dynamic quality and overall performance of the movement. When the movement is small or miniature, it's hard to see all those details and all the work that is being put into the choreography. I would also encourage a dancer to not only just use their hips, but also isolate their ribcage more, so they have full embodiment of the rhythm. I would also encourage the dancer to be a little bit more fluid in their arms.

The dancer does a great job, the lead dancer that is, bringing the dancer's hand and an arm over the head and turning her into himself in a way. Dancers are in unison. They are connected with the music, with the movement. They are listening to the rhythm and the song. They are listening and watching one another. The movement is great and the two are in sync. However, if these steps were not choreographed, one should be able to still go through movement if the leading dancer is able to utilize their role in an effective way where they are directing the dancer, where the turns are and what the steps are. As long as you know the basic steps, a dance could look just like this, whether it's choreographed or not. The timing is very nice with these two dancers. When they go to shift and change hands, the dancers have steps in between and they begin and end them at the same time, not losing connection with the dancer. Musicality wise, like based on the music, they do let go hands, but if they were holding hands, it would have looked the same, the way that they were both in sync with one another and they were on the right count and the right step with the feet.

This is a good example right here. I really like the players striking technique here, taking a longer run up as a longer final step with the left foot. Arms are out for balance, this longer step has helped bring the non-kicking foot next to the ball and then the striking foot swinging from a further distance to come through the ball in this area. The player has struck the ball straight down the middle of the goal. This would be saved by the goalkeeper. We want to be aiming for these side window pockets here as this gives the best chance of scoring. The player has also struck the ball with very little power due to not having a large run up and not attempting to put any power into the shot. Good use of the arms for balance by the player. There's a good body shape, I like that. Players taking a very short and quick run up into the ball. This isn't conducive to having a proper strike and generating power. We would instead want them to step two or three steps back so they could actually run up and into the ball to strike it. The player has made good contact with the inside of the foot, follow through has gone through the line of the ball. This helps with the power and accuracy. The player's approach to the ball would be better with a bigger distance. This allows him to step into the ball, create more power so that when the shot is taken he has a better chance of beating the goalkeeper. The player's non-kicking foot is too close to the ball. Positioning-wise, it could be a little further forward, but this is okay. We certainly would want the ball to be more in this region here, as that would mean his right foot, the striking foot, can swing through the ball and not have to swing really close to his left knee. The player has not created enough power on the shot and so that would have been saved by the goalkeeper. The accuracy is also not in the corner. This is too close to the centre of the goal. Goalkeeper would save it. Body shape, leaning away, arms really out there for balance, non-kicking foot, knees bent, all these are good at keeping the player balanced. Contact point with the laces, his heel is up, toe is down, ankle locked, and striking through the ball. I really like the player's angle of approach. It helps to allow the striking leg to swing through the ball. I like the non-kicking foot placement. And the player's body shape could be a little bit lower, a little bit more bent in the knee to help with the balance, but he isn't moving at that great of a speed. So balance isn't that important to him at this moment. Good accuracy, put the ball in the side net in, see where we want the ball to go. However, it needs to go there with more power. The player can generate more power by actually placing the ball down, having a set run up and making sure that they go through the mechanics. Right now the player is just rushing through each shot, which is not conducive to improving this specific technique. Mae'n bwysig iawn. Ball yn y gwrn o'r golwg, yn y ffyrdd, lle rhaid i ni ei wneud.

So, this is good placement of the ball on the backboard, but when we hit this portion of the backboard, we have to make sure that the side spin that we use is a slight amount of side spin or no side spin at all. Because if we put too much side spin on the ball, as it hits this portion of the backboard, it can spin off and end up hitting the left side of the rim, and then that's how we end up missing this layup. In this case, he put too much side spin on the ball, and it bounced off the backboard and hit the left side of the rim. After making the layup, he does a good job of catching the ball. However, he allows the ball to drop down to his waist area. When we're doing the Mike and Drill, we want to keep the ball high near our upper chest or neck area and never allow the ball to drop down to our waist level. The player here shows the proper footwork for doing a right hand layup on the right side of the basket when we're doing the Miken drill. And we're doing the Miken drill where we're jumping off of one foot. So you see he is jumping off of his left foot. Now when we're jumping off of our left foot, we want to try to get as high up into the air as we possibly can. In order to do that, we have to make sure that this right knee is raised up to the level of our hips. As you can see, his knee is far below the level of his waist so he didn't give maximum effort or anywhere near the maximum effort to jump as high as possible in order to finish the layup and release the ball at the highest possible point. Let's take a look at the placement of the ball on the backboard. You can see it's well outside of the square on the backboard and it's also above the top portion of the square on the backboard. You can see from this view, it's a better view and you can see just how much higher from the top of the square the ball actually hit the backboard. So as it's placed outside of the square and the height at which the ball hit the backboard is also very good. However, from this position, we need to make sure that we put enough side spin on the ball so the ball can spin off of the backboard and go directly into the basket from this position on the backboard. With this shot attempt, the player didn't put enough side spin on the ball so it hit this portion of the backboard and then it dropped down and fell short of the rim. he correctly catches the ball out of the net and then he's as he's catching the ball out of the net he steps with his right foot to the left side of the basket catches it and then jumps off of his left foot in order to shoot the layup in his left hand on the left side of the basket. As you can see again now on this side his left knee is low and we want that left knee to be up towards his knee level, towards his hip level in order to explode on the jump and reach the highest possible point of his jump so he can release the ball instead of releasing the ball here if he jumps higher he can release the ball here and the higher the release point the more difficult it is for the defense to block the shot Go to www.Flydreamers.com for all of your free flyer training!", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She's bending her knee effectively while straightening that back leg that's crossing behind the supporting leg. She could use a little bit refinement in the positioning of her arm, particularly her hands. She's also kind of overextending her elbow here, so some additional clarity in the shaping of the arms, particularly the one that's reaching above her head, but also the one that's crossing in front specifically with the shaping of her hands. As the dancer performs some quicker footwork, crossing this right leg over the left leg in a small jump or a pattern of small jumps, she demonstrates that she's able to move very quickly and efficiently and maintain the appropriate kind of size of movement to move so quickly while maintaining that rhythmic embodiment. She would again benefit from some additional movement in her pelvis and perhaps a more complex engagement of her upper body, including her arms. However, she's able to stay on the rhythm and on tempo as she performs these quicker, more advanced steps. As the dancer performs this basic salsa step, moving backwards and forwards in the space, she demonstrates that she has a fair understanding of the movement vocabulary, as well as the rhythmic embodiment required for this movement. She would benefit from grounding a bit more, dropping that pelvis back and bending the knees, as well as some additional clarity in her arm choreography, and some additional motion happening particularly in her pelvis and the engagement of the upper body. As the dancer performs this ball change moving backwards into the space, she's able to effectively and clearly engage her arms choreographically, as well as maintain a nice slight bend in the knees and a nice and appropriate range of motion in the pelvis. Overall, she appears confident in this step and she's even able to engage the arms in a way that's dynamically interesting. As the dancer performs this small shimmying or bouncing of her shoulders, she's got a nice clear positioning with her arms choreographically, as well as a nice slight bend in her knees. She's able to move her shoulders on rhythm here, which shows that she's able to deeply embody the rhythm and add some interesting movement dynamics as well. As the dancer performs a series of small step touches, she demonstrates that she has stronger control over her rhythmic embodiment, particularly in her lower body. She's able to play with different rhythms in the music, as well as maintains clarity in her upper body, in her arms, her torso, and her head.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So you want to make sure that your form is correct and just very strong, especially in this front arm, because if it doesn't, then it looks kind of cartoonish and kind of like you're playing around and not really being serious in the moment. So definitely want to have really strong arms. But I do like that both eyes are facing the side. They're facing the same direction, and they're moving together. So here they are standing side by side. His left arm is at his shoulder and then his right arm is down close to the lower of his back but they are crossed together and they are stepping forward and back with a little chasse forward and ball change step and then chasse back. So really nice job here staying together and also using the outside leg at the same time. So again still that same mirror effect that they're doing. Here they're just taking some steps forward and back. Again, I think if they were much better to be on the correct beat of the music it would just look a little bit better but because they're so off it's just hard to kind of follow and really connect if they're so off the music. So here they did a little body change and movement with each other. They're a bit off. They're just not quite doing the exact same thing, so I'm not sure what the choreography is meant to be. We have a nice little different movement in the arm. So they have this full circle to keep themselves connected. And they're both facing the opposite direction and stepping around. So really nice job making that transition very seamless from the last formation. So here's a good space where they both, they're doing different things, but they're actually complimenting each other as he's pulling him through and around. So that looks nice. I definitely think they can both bend their knees a little bit more and try to step a little bit lighter on their feet. So here they're just doing some like small chasse to the side and a ball change. There are some moments where they are matching each other's movements, but most times they are not. So that just kind of brings down the step. So here the dancers are stepping forward and back. I like that they are doing the opposite legs. So he's using his right leg and he's using his left. So it's almost like a mirror to each other. So here when they, after they switch places and go around, they're still connected by the hand correctly, but they are kind of leaning their body back as they step out of the connection. And he doesn't need to lean back that far. I think you still want to kind of keep your body as straight as possible, just straight up and down and less pulling back. Cause it looks like you're actually pulling each other. So here's a walk around. I definitely think they can either disconnect hands or at least just kind of pick up their energy a little bit more and pick up their feet so it's not so heavy to the floor. So here they're doing some jump kicks forward. They're not quite as in sync for this one, so they are a little bit off the... They're definitely off the music as a whole, but also with each other. They're not together. But the jumps are really good. They're keeping their movements nice and light as they move through the jumps.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

They're a little too focused on the hands Which is why we see the foot kind of pop off the first move before they begin setting up Ideally they can make the first few moves static by coming underneath into this undercling and then reaching up to the hold But the way there's charging up anticipates that they just want to commit to making this a bigger move, which is Potentially doable but much higher risk. It's such a large move that if they make a mistake attempting it It's gonna invalidate the attempt. They'll just fall So you see a climber releasing way too early, their foot's almost on the ground as their hand is reaching towards the hold, so there's just no chance they're going to be able to hit it from this position. It's probably doable as a dyno to jump across that way, but for the way they're climbing it, they're just not going to hit the move this way and it causes them to fall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

As we can see when the climber went up for the reach she had kept the right knee to come inwards and that helped for the climber to keep her right side of the body towards the wall when performing the reach. The climber was able to send the left hand quickly to the next hole at reach, this one being a jug, where the climber is able to secure the hand placement. However, it's all about the body position. This one, because the left leg was out and extended as a flag, the climber only areas of support were onto the right side. So to avoid herself from doing a barn door, which is like, think of a hinge that opens up, the climber folds the left leg behind the right leg. This to add, with the left foot pointing out to the right, is to give more support to the right side and twists the body over to the left to bring her center of gravity close to the wall when performing the reach. The climber continues into a close pull up to lock the move. And this is because right now the climber is staring at the next hold at reach. This is because if the climber was to extend the arms right now, she will be dropping the weight too low, being really hard to pull in if she wanted to come back. The climber was able to recover the move by bringing the left foot to come into place over the start hold and she continues to glance down at the feet to perform a foot switch by bringing the right toe to come into place over the edge of the hold to release the left foot from its place. The climber performing this type of foot switch technique is the most accurate one. This is because it's more energy efficient and the climber can transfer the load easily from one foot to the other coming into place. The climber once securing the toe placement we can see how she has brought the knee to come inwards towards the wall so that she was able to transfer over the weight to the right foot. In doing so the climber quickly releases the right hand to bring it over to a match at the hold above. The climber was able to place the left hand grip into a solid hand grip. This one because the climber is sustaining to the lip of the hold being a rail and is able to place the fingers behind the lip of the hold. Once the climber gets to secure the grip, then the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the highest grip. The climber right now is glancing at a hold at reach. This one the climber will have to perform a dynamic move. Reason why she has lower her center of gravity and extended the arms in order to gain energy over the jump. As we can see the left leg being extended. This is called flagging out and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. Now the right foot when being pressed for going up for the dynamic move will help the climber to gain height. And the left toe tapped against the wall will help the climber to gain direction on the reach as well as bringing her center of gravity close to the wall when performing the stance. In this case, before the climber was able to perform the next move at reach, she is bringing the right toe to come out of match at the foot hold. And this is so the climber is performing a foot switch where she is placing the outer edge of the toe towards the hold. And as soon as the climber releases the left toe from its place, the climber then will roll in the toe above the hold. The climber on the lock position sends quickly the left hand out for the reach, this one being a positive grip as the climber is able to wrap the hand over the hold. The climber was able to gain a stability over the movement by sending the right leg to be extended behind the left foot. This again back flagging so the climber can gain a stability over the move and quickly once it's stabilized the climber sends the left hand over to the jug to come into a match where the right hand is. The climber at first was struggling on making a foot placement for the left toe but brings it quickly into a high foot placement to bring it behind the hold securing the toe placement. As soon as the climber applied pressure onto the foothold, the climber's right toe has come out of place from the hold. Right now the climber is sustaining onto the grips for a slight swing due to the wall being overhung. It's important the climber always glances down at the feet, especially when making a new foot placement. In this case, the climber is bringing the left toe to come into a high foot placement over the foot hold. This one sticks out and makes it possible for the climber to place a good chunk area of the toe over the hold. Once the climber gets secured the foot placement, then the climber can move on to the next hold at reach. Due to the opening of the left hand grip being slightly onto the left side, the climber must drop the weight by leaning back to the right. And now the climber is twisting the body completely at a 180 to bring the right side of the body towards the wall in order to bring the left foot to a high foot placement. The climber starts at a one hold start. As we can see, both of the hands are placed into the same hold. This is called matching. And as we can see, the climber is placing the hands as open grips where she places the fingers over the edge of the hold. However, the climber must create pressure, the reason why the climber is leaning over to the left side due to the entry being onto the right side of the hold. The climber had performed a step up start, so once the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall, then the climb will start. And had positioned the left foot onto a foot hold. And bringing the knee in, so the climber can keep the left side of the body towards the wall. Now, when the climber had stepped up, the right leg has gone extended. This is called flagging out, so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. And keeping the leg on a flag when the climber performs the move will help the climber to gain balance and stability over the move. The climber had repositioned the right hand grip, this one to hook it behind the hold as the hold is a horn so the climber can continue to have a closed grip. In this case, the climber in releasing some of the pressure on the hand to readjust the grip she has kept the left leg to be extended. This is called flagging out so the climber was able to continue to apply pressure onto the right foot being in place. As we can see, the climber is sending the right knee over to the right to keep the hips square as the climber is pressing the right toe towards the lip of the hold onto the right side. Now the climber is glancing over to the next hold at reach. Due to the dynamic move, the climber has lost pressure at the right foot placement and now both of the feet in the air, the climber must sustain tight onto the grips to control the swing. And in able to bring the foot back into place onto the wall, the climber must engage body tension to tighten up the core to pick up the feet to replace the foot back onto the wall. When the feet are out in the air, this is called cutting feet. The climber at this moment is spending a considerable amount of time to look for a foot placement on the left foot and Right now the climber is sustaining to a positive grip above which the climber can sustain over for some time however Doing this for a while it can tire the grips The climber after positioning the toe over the foothold then she quickly releases the right hand that was underneath the left hand to send it over to the next hold at reach. This type of hold that she is sustaining, she is able to place the hand over the lip of the hold being a jug and once securing the grip the climber can extend the arm to drop the weight onto the grip. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet when performing a foot placement or a foot switch. In this case, the climber has brought the right foot that was out on the flag to bring the toe to come into place at a foothold. It's important that the climber is accurate with the placement on positioning exactly on a certain spot of the foothold as well as positioning the right area of the foot to create pressure. As we can see on this view, also the right hand was sustaining into a positive hold as the climber was able to wrap around the hand behind the lip of the hold. The climber now engages into a pull-up to bring the right hand over to a match at the last hold. This, the climber must demonstrate control and stability over the match as well as her body position in order to complete the climb. The climber is about to perform the next move at reach, sending the left hand up. So the climber in this moment is tapping the right toe towards the wall, this to engage more power over the reach as the climber will send the heart over the left foot and the tap will help the climber to drive force onto the stance.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

We'd like to see when that leg comes around, that standing leg a little bit more stable so that the dancer can pivot off of that back leg and bring that leg around a little bit more and that standing leg goes into a bended leg so that we can get more mobility and action out of that left leg that comes around when the dancer hits the foot.

So here he crosses over in front right now with his left leg. He draws his arm to cross over his head, which is a nice improvised movement, and change the arms. I do think he could have maybe used the space a little bit more on the cross and rotate his body to face the side as he crossed over, just to give a bit of a different dynamic since he's facing front for the entire time. Here the dancer starts stepping in place. He does a really good job picking his feet up off the floor slightly. His knees are nicely bent and he has a good rotation in his arms, shoulders, and back. Here as he taps forward, nice job keeping the knees nicely bent, tapping out, and then also changing the arms a little bit so they're also tapping with the foot, as well as moving a little bit of hips and shoulder movements as well. Here he steps out to the side. I think this heel could come off the floor just a little bit, but he does do a good job getting a nice space between the legs, keeping the knees nicely bent, and again, keeping the upper body moving around.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They have a lot of clarity, particularly in their footwork. They're incorporating their arms in a way that's clear, though it's a bit stiff and lacking connection to the rhythm and movement dynamics. And overall, they're really suffering from not grounding. They need to bend their knees deeper, drop their pelvis, and activate a sense of polyrhythm or movement dynamic within their pelvis and upper body in general. As a dancer begins with a basic stationary salsa step, they appear to be familiar with the movement vocabulary and comfortable executing the movement. They are including their arms choreographically in a way that makes sense and is appropriate for the movement technique, and are maintaining a steady connection to the rhythm, particularly through the use of their feet and incorporating some slight movement through the head. However, they appear quite stiff from their pelvis through their upper body to their shoulders. If they were to bend their knees a bit more, drop the pelvis back, be more grounded, loose and natural, and a bit more weighted in their movement, they would appear to execute the movement with more clarity, efficiency, and connection to the rhythm and the music. As the dancer performs a series of turns, he falls off the tempo demands of the music, which disconnects him from his rhythmic embodiment, particularly because he doesn't consistently spot his head, which is making him move through these turns more slowly than the music is demanding and thus throwing him off from the rhythmic embodiment. As the dancer begins a basic salsa step where they're stepping one foot out meeting the feet back in the middle and then alternating sides They find a bit more clarity and connection to the rhythm particularly through this nice bend in their knees and a slight dropping back of the pelvis They also are continuing to incorporate their arms in a way that's choreographically appropriate However, because their upper body in general is quite stiff from the lack of grounding in their performance Their arms are also coming off a bit stiff as well keeping them from deeply connecting to the rhythm", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The dancer's left arm here is bent and instead he should be extending it completely in a straight line. The dancer has to be careful here in how, in which he's raising his shoulders. His shoulder blades are raised very high, which eliminates his neckline and makes him look tense in his upper body area. So this is not a part of the dance choreography, but instead the dancer is freestyling and doing movements of his own choosing as a way to feel the music and mentally and physically prepare for the dance routine, as well as get into his body and his own artistry and interpretation. So it's really good that he is moving like this prior to the start of the dance routine. The dancer is turning on a flat foot with his entire foot on the ground, his toes, the ball of his foot, meaning the middle of his foot, and his heels. Instead, when the dancer hits his ending pose in which he was raising his arms out towards his left side, he should hold that pose, remain frozen and still, so that it is clear that the dance is ending and that he finishes in a neat position. Especially since it's the very last movement of the dance routine, it's important that it's done meticulously and with care. The dancer is looking downward on his turn. The floor is in his view, as well as his head and neck are tilted downward. The dancer exits his ending pose very quickly, and so it's not very clear as to what it is because it happens so fast, and it's not done in a way that the audience's eye can take it in as a strong finish. Instead, the dancer should be pressing his shoulder blades down. It's okay that his elbows are pointing outward. Also they should be pointing outward on the same angle, one is higher than the other. But in general, it's okay that his elbows are pointing outward, he just needs to also simultaneously press his shoulder blades down so his neckline remains elongated. Instead, the dancer should raise his focus and look straight ahead with his chin parallel to the floor, which would help him not get dizzy as he does a revolution or rotation in this turn.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As the dancer continues through the choreography, she quite clearly doesn't remember the choreography and is struggling to reenact it. She is really almost consistently looking off camera over her left shoulder, perhaps to another dancer or instructor in the room, and overall just appears a little bit confused in the choreography and therefore is not able to execute it. As the dancer begins his choreography, right off the bat she's thrown off from the music and appears a bit confused about her starting timing. You can see here she's looking over her left shoulder quite significantly, perhaps to someone or something off camera, and overall appears a bit hesitant as she begins his choreography. As the dancer continues through the choreography, she starts to appear quite confident, engaging a greater range of motion in her pelvis, her upper body, and her shoulders. She continues to consistently incorporate her arms as well as find some consistent clarity in her footwork as well. As the dancer gets back into the choreography and starts to find her place within the movement again, she right away is able to connect again to the rhythm of the music and has a strong incorporation of her arms choreographically in a way that's clear, precise, and appropriate. She also has similar clarity in her footwork and is able to incorporate movement in her pelvis and through her upper body. Once the dancer catches the choreography once again and begins to find some clarity, right away she's able to quickly connect to the rhythm of the music.

Looking at the player's release from his right-handed reverse layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice that the player does really well at jumping with full maximum effort, allowing his body's momentum, carrying him forward closer towards the target. The player also does really well extending his follow-through above his shoulders, allowing the ball to gain more arc to get above the rim. Thanks for watching! Looking at the player going into his jump on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player does really well locating his eyes on his target before going into his release, allowing a much easier finish. Also does really well jumping off his left foot, allowing his body's momentum to carry and guide him towards the right side of the rim. Thanks for watching! Looking at the player's release on his right-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice that the player does really well at getting his shoulders square towards the back of the rim after the release, allowing the ball a better angle of being directed accurately towards the target area. The player also does a good job getting his fall through extended above his shoulder, allowing the ball to create a higher release to get above the rim, going as we look on the left side of the frame, directly towards our target point, allowing it to create the proper angle it needs of dropping inside the rim, resulting in a completed layup attempt. Looking at the player's release on his right-handed reverse layup attempt on the left frame, we can notice that the player does really well getting his follow-through and wrist snapping towards the direction of the rim in our target area, allowing the ball to create the proper spin and rotation and arc it needs to get above the rim, hitting our target area, which is going to be the top right corner of the box on the backboard, allowing it to develop the proper angle it needs, dropping inside the rim. Looking at the player going into his jumping motion, on his right hand at reverse layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice that the player does really well jumping forward with full maximum effort, allowing the ball to gain enough momentum, power, and art to get above the rim. The player also does really well squaring his shoulders towards the back of the rim, allowing the ball to travel accurately in a better angle towards the target point. Looking at the player going into his right-handed reverse layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice that the player does really well, getting his body placement position low in an athletic stance, allowing himself to become more balanced, quicker, and more explosive going into his jump on the right side of the rim. As we look at the release of the player's right-handed reverse layup attempt on the left frame, we can notice that the player does really well at getting his follow-through going towards the direction of the basket after the release, allowing the ball to create the proper spin and rotation it needs to travel directly towards our target point. As we look on the left frame, we can tell and notice that the ball hits our target point, which is going to be the top right corner of the box on the backboard, allowing it to develop the proper angle it needs to drop inside the rim. A slight improvement the player can make to avoid potential turnovers in a game-like scenario as we look on the right side of the frame is bringing his ball placement position above his shoulders, creating separation from opposing defenders. In a game-like scenario, having easy access of stripping, taking, or stealing the ball. This also helps the player create more ball control and security going into his finish as well as creating a closer gap of releasing the ball quicker towards our target area. Another benefit that helps the player from his body placement position being lower in the athletic stance as we look on the right frame helps prevent opposing defenders in a game-like scenario being able to easily knock the offensive player off his position by initiating contact. The lower the player becomes the more power he has and balance going towards the rim.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This is so that the climber is able to maintain balance as he will need to force by shifting his weight onto the highest foot. Also when climber makes the move, it will help the climber to keep the hips square and to keep himself close to the wall. Here, in order for the climber to release the right toe out of place, he has brought the left toe to be placed on top of the matching hold that he had instead. This to release the right foot out of place. The climber continually needs to pull on the grips while making this foot switch. If the climber was going to try this again, it's important that the climber uses the resource of the left pinch. There's many forms in which a climber can achieve a series of moves to attain the goal. In this case, the right foot was way too high for the climber and made it very uncomfortable for him to shift the weight over to the highest foot. The outer side of the foot was what was placed onto that edge and it seemed promising that the climber's foot was going to remain in such place. However, what drove the climber's center of gravity away from the wall was the moment that he released his right hand. This due to the left foot not being placed on any hold down below, only relying on two points of contact at that moment. So it's important to the climber if he was going to attempt this again that he scans down at other areas where he can place his feet in order to release his right hand. When the climber released the left hand carefully from going underneath the foot and as soon as he places the elbow outside the leg, you can see how the climber was losing control of keeping himself in control to make the next move. Notice followed by the right foot coming out of place. The climber starts at a two hand hold start. As we can see the right hand is placed with the fingers above and the climber in order to create pressure has to lean underneath that hold. On the other hand, you can see how the climber's hold is upside down. This is a jug and in order to create friction the climber will have to place the palm upwards and slide the fingers behind the hold. Now in order for the climber to create pressure, we'll need to pull the hold towards him. As we can see the climb will start until the feet are off the mat, which he's already doing. The left foot right now is being placed on the foot chip down below. The right foot is coming into position to match where the left hand is. As the climber have reached the left hand to the pinch, we can see the climber sending the right foot that was out on the flag to be placed to match where his right hand grip is. The type of hold that the climber is holding onto and has placed the foot on, it's a ledge that sticks out so the climber can bring the right foot and apply sufficient pressure onto that edge with the outer side of the foot. This is an unusual placement as most likely he might potentially use this as a heel hook in the future if he continues to keep the foot on place. Now the climber is a bit crunched up to the right side and needs to release the right hand. In order to add force to the foot that's placed the highest, the climber has let go of the left foot placement down below. This to apply more force onto the right foot being placed which he will use almost like a third hand since this will keep the climber to keep himself pulled into the wall. Since the right foot has come into a stance, the climber quickly releases the left hand that was on the undercling so that he gets to bring it to a match where the right hand is. This one is a big hold so the climber is able to comfortably fit both of the hands by wrapping the fingers behind it and comfortably leaning on the hold. The climber places the toe above the hold as he pulls on the hold down below. This is called matching and it's important that the climber keeps pressure at the foot against the hold in order to sustain himself when pulling on the grips above. This because the climber is placing the entire leg in front of him. Now the climber will need to think about making the next movement.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Because the climber hasn't placed any foot placements onto the wall, he is right now engaging onto a pull-up in order to move on. This is called campusing. The climber, once sustaining the positive grip above being the edge, he is able to then lean back to place the weight onto the grip. As we can see, he's pivoting over his foot because he's sending the ankle outwards in order to smear the foot against the hold as he needs to continually have contact with the hold to not lose the foot placement. So it's like dragging the sole of the shoe to be repositioned where he can't face the wall this time. The climber performing campusing doesn't only involve fully on a pull-up, it also involves body movement and swinging to gain momentum. So when the climber is having the momentum of the swing, whenever he goes out for example to the right, he will engage that right arm on a pull-up to release the left hand. Whenever the climber is ready to engage of the left hand for example, then he will swing over the body over to the left in order to release the right hand. At this view we can see how the climber is sustaining to a jug hold and the good thing about jugs is that they can be held in any direction so the climber must squeeze into the hold forcefully in order to sustain the grip as he right now is going out on the swing almost as a pendulum totally on 180 at this moment so it's important that the climber eventually tightens up the core and engages on the pull up so that he's able to slow down the swing This is the ideal closeness that should be committed on this type of jump. As a climber, as we can see, the chest was brought forward and then the core, being the center of gravity, will follow as the climber starts gaining height. The left hand is still continuing to be on the hand placement and instead of pulling himself in, he's also pushing down onto that hand placement. But at this point, it's just a placement as the climber already is launched onto the air and eventually he will push down onto the right foot to boost the move. The right hand is already pretty close at distance since he has already removed it from the start hold. It's about a matter of time for the climber to bring the right hand to come into a slap above the hold. The climber is gaining momentum right now by swinging and also when doing so, the climber was constantly adjusting the grips. This is important. The climber secures the grips before committing onto the dynamic move. As the climber brings his center of gravity low, he's aiming at the hold of distance by making eye contact. It's important that he does so while building up on the momentum of the swing. This is because the climber will have to launch himself over to the hold and needs to make sure he gets to select which area of the hold he will make the hand placement as well. When the climber is ready, he will engage into a forceful pull and push down on the feet to bring his center of gravity close to the wall by bringing the chest forward against the wall. Now the climber pushing on the left foot will help him gain direction to stay underneath the hold and over going slightly to the right side. And eventually when the climber is gaining height, he will push onto the right foot in order to boost the jump. As we can see the climber was able to stabilize himself from swinging continuing to tighten up his body and at this moment the climber is glancing over to hold that distance since it's very difficult to do when the climber is swinging and it's important that he brings his center of gravity underneath his area of support before making the next move. In this case, the climber now's center of gravity is past the area of support. He has to send the left hand to bring himself to recover the move. So it's important that the climber continues to force the core to be tightened and try to pull himself in as he will continue to swing out. The climber is able to send the left hand up for a match at the jug. He is looking away so that he is able to gain more reach over the left hand placement. The climber must demonstrate control and stability over his body positioning as well as matching the hold. If the climber is able to do this, then the climb is completed. Here the climber was able to sustain onto that underhand onto the lip of the hold and has brought his center of gravity close to the wall, this one being on the core. And underhand placements are really strong as the climber is able to place the hand above him when his center of gravity was low by pulling away on the wall and it gets stronger when the climber gains height as he's able to pull the elbow close to his core once making a solid foot placement. Now the climber is sending the right hand over to the hole that reach, placing the hand over the corner top of the hold. The climber will be going out on the swing due to the right foot being engaged, pushing his center of gravity away from the wall. However, the climber was able to secure the right hand placement by wrapping the fingers around the thick edge of the hold and must create friction to catch by closing the grip. It's good that the climber secures the hand placement before he drops the weight. Dropping the weight will come into place once the climber gets to line up his center of gravity underneath his right hand placement. As he's going onto the swing, the climber is also bringing the left hand to bring it over to match the dining hold, which will help the climber support the swing by pulling in. Once the climber's center of gravity starts being pushed away, it's important that he tries to keep a body tension, mostly on the upper body, engaging in a slight pull up to pull himself in and tightening up the core so he doesn't get to swing out completely. The climber brought the right hand over too much at the same lip where the left hand is and The climber is now making an adjustment of the left hand to come as an under hand over the top edge of the hold This is preparing himself ahead of time For when making the right foot placement too soon once the climber makes that right foot placement He will gain height and at that point having both hands onto the same edge will be difficult to sustain as When the climber is just singing to the bottom edge She will have to be below the hold but in this case if he's going to be gaining height after making the height foot position then ideally would be that the climber sustains to the top area of the hold The climbers hand placement starts at a two hole start. This one each hand has its own hold and both of them are rounded with a hole in the inside of the hold. These ones are called donuts so the climbers able to slide the fingers all the way at the inside of the hold. This one as is with a groove in that area the climber can place the fingertips and squeeze onto the hold as he's able to place the thumbs on the outside of the hold in order to secure the grip. The climber once does it he will be able to lean back trusting on the grips in order to transfer over the weight. Also the climber has brought the feet onto placement the left foot is on a small foot hold and the right foot is on a larger hold where the climber is able to surface the front area of his shoe towards the flat surface of the hold. Since the climber is no longer in the mat and the climb will start. Because the climber was able to bring both of the hands at a match, he sensed the left foot to come into place at the large hold. Now the climber is pushing away from the hold in order to keep his center of gravity below his aerial reach. As the climber needed to gain height in this instance, he has pushed away in the hold as well as pulled himself tightly trying to lock the move. In this instance to send the left hand over to the next hold. This one is a promising hold as the climber has a deep area where the climber can place the fingertips behind the edge of the hold and can sustain it also by pressing on the thumb to secure the grip. As for his body positioning, we can see how his right leg has been extended. This is called flagging out and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place as well as keeping his right side towards the wall to keep his center of gravity underneath the top area of support. For performing the canvassing movement, it's not only that the climber engages in the pull-up, but also he takes advantage of the momentum on his body moving. So in this case, when the climber's body is moving out to the right, he is able to engage in a pull so he can transfer over the left hand to come into a match. Once the climber is airborne, there is going to be a fraction of a second where he's no longer in contact with the wall. This is the moment where he jumps, all of the limbs leave the holds and his right hand is about to come into placement at the hold. In this case, the climber must force the contact of the right hand onto the Dine Hold when having this moment. This moment the climber made a right foot placement and this one being high up the climber then now needs to continue to apply force to the top left hand placement. This one not only he is pulling down on his right hand but this time he is actually pulling away from the wall with the left hand. This one pulling the hold in two different directions so that he's able to secure his movement as he gains height. The next hold is the one distance in which the climber will have to gain sufficient height by fully standing up in order to transition the right hand later on to come into a match at the hold or potentially going up for the reach. The left hand grip the one that is up over underhand this one will need to be sustained when gaining height with the elbow close to the core in order to apply gripping power. At this moment the climber is at mid-jump and we can see how he has pulled himself in, trying to bring the chest as close as he can to the wall, and already has pushed away the left foot from its foothold, sending him already at that direction to stay underneath the hold. As the climber was swinging, he kept adjusting his hand placements. It's important that the climber focuses on making those placements secure before committing onto the dino jump. In this case, the climber is already had swung and right now he's extending his arms to lower his center of gravity and keep the feet above him as he will have to spring out of the move in order to make the hold that reach. As the climber needs to make the hold that reach, it's important that he stares at the hold at distance when positioning his body and while making the swing. The swing was so that the climber is able to gain momentum for when he's ready. He will pull himself forward, bringing the chest towards the wall and he will be pushing down on the feet. The left foot will be used to spring him out over to that direction to stay underneath the hold and then eventually the right foot will be engaged to boost the jump.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So in general he's being very efficient about keeping certain fingers down when he doesn't have to lift them. So that finger independence and that control shows some really good left hand technique. To play this arpeggio pattern, his hand had to shift down the fretboard that direction, and he reached the note accurately, and his finger was in the right spot. As he's playing these arpeggios up and down the fingerboard, he's changing hand positions accurately. However, there are a few notes that he doesn't have the finger pressed down hard enough, so there's a few kind of muted sounds in between some of the notes, but it's not super noticeable. If you look at his left hand here, his fingers are really close to the strings and he's not letting go of his fingers very tall. He's keeping them very close to the strings so he's able to move from note to note with general ease. His left hand shape looks really good. He's using the tips of his fingers, his knuckles are curved, and he's using the right amount of weight to make each note sound clear. He's now playing these chordal patterns in a step-by-step scale motion, and he's playing them with accurate hand shapes, and the strumming pattern sounds really nice as he's playing multiple strings at a time. There's a very noodley quality to the playing that he's doing. The tempo kind of tends to fluctuate. It's not clear if he's trying to play these arpeggios with a really steady beat or if he's trying to just be very casual about whizzing through them. He played all the accurate notes of this scale going up and down the fretboard very easily without making many mistakes changing between different hand positions. Not every note can be heard at the same volume as he's playing these arpeggios. It'd be nicer to hear a more even sound across every single note. As he gets higher, the notes get a little quieter and his fingers aren't quite as coordinated to get that clearer sound as he's going faster. He's using the tips of his fingers to be very precise with each note, and with this finger right here, he actually vibrated it a little bit and wiggled his finger there to warm up the sound at the end, which is nice to hear. As you watch him pick with his right hand, he's alternating. So when he's on the same string, he goes down, up, down, up. And so sometimes he has to change strings, but he keeps that pattern throughout. So every separated note is very distinct and evenly played.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Okay, this is the Mike and drill. It's a drill used for inside players mostly, post players to work on their touch around the basket. In this video, you're going to see the participants start on the right side and then move underneath the basket to the left side. He's shooting with the correct foot, off the correct foot, on the left side using the left hand. He's going to cross over to the right side here. Again, he's going off two feet. You'd like for him to drive off that left foot, kick the right knee up. Again, great touch with the right hand on using the backboard. Definitely better footwork on this drill. You wanna, when you're stepping over to the left side, you wanna step on the right foot and take off that right foot, pulling the left leg up, shooting with the left hand. So on this shot, this frame, the ball goes in the basket, high on the backboard, top of the square, great touch with the left hand, but you'd like to see a little bit more knee lift with that left knee pulling up and elevating on the shot. He's gonna cross. He's looking like he's shooting more of a hook shot, however. I'd like to see that right shoulder square up to the basket a little bit more. So it's more face on shooting where he's got the right arm in facing the basket. Like both shoulders need to be facing that backboard. He's definitely shooting a hook shot. Some people do the Mike and drill that way. I've taught it more as a shot where you're both shoulders square to the backboard. Again, more aggressiveness, more intensity when crossing over from side to side. He's kind of just walking through it, going off two feet.

So I would encourage them to think about is it like a gliding waltz or is it more of a rhythmic kind of internal bounce like a jig that's happening. So getting a one and chord with this dynamic quality will also help the partners cut across and ease through space. This arm connection here is super important. That, again, we talk about pressure of the pushing and pulling. By flicking their wrists or pressing their wrists out one way, it tells the dancer which way to go. So it's really important that the dancer executes this power and dynamic quality in order to guide their partner around the space. I would encourage the dancers to make sure that they have a stronger frame. Notice how their arms are down. So really to lift those arms and have this kind of wide frame and base to work from. So they create kind of a trapezoid or a parallelogram with their arms and kind of have this strong base with arms connected up top. Or it would be more like this, connected through the top. Right now by having the arms so low, we don't know which way they're going and it's hard for a partner to guide the other person on which way to step. Overall, I would encourage these partners to really think about weight shifting and the pushing and pulling of two opposite sides of a pendulum, kind of like a seesaw, right? And how that moving together, pushing out and then coming in and pushing out again, creates momentum of movement. So if they were to go out to each side versus when they come in close, like how they are now, how can they do that by using resistance and weight shifts and also by engaging that core and taking very precise and big steps. I would encourage dancers, they're pretty grounded right now, but I would encourage the dancer to really engage their core and rotate those shoulders forward, up and back in order to have more precision and power throughout their movement. Notice how the dancer's arm is kind of low here. What they need to do is lift that elbow up. And even though it can still, arm could still be under the armpit here, but this arm should be, this dancer's arm should be resting on top of the dancer's arm in the green shorts. So one arm is underneath the other. So one arm is underneath the other. So if this is the person's body, right? And this is the other person's body, the arm should be underneath the other arm. And then that arm should rest on top. So it kind of lifts both arms up and they create this kind of box shape that I was talking about a little bit earlier. So then they can have power and strength to be able to push and pull and guide. Right now, it's hard for the dancer, the shorter dancer to know where they're being guided to because they don't have any pressure telling them where to go. And it should be a respectful pressure. It should be a strategic technical dance pressure that they feel on their body, not a painful pressure.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So she is in this nice balanced position, you know, both hands are on this hold, but she needs to stay sucked under the wall. Cause now you can see her body's coming out away from the wall, which is causing her to pull up. You can see her arms are quite engaged, but the further left she gets, this sloping hold, it's going to be harder to stay on. Whereas if she's kind of below it and sucked underneath it, her arms are straight and she's kind of pulling straight through it and her body position's creating a lot more friction for her to stay on. So again on this attempt, she looks strong starting it. She hits it again left-handed. And she is able to get her left hand on it as well. So she is able to match it briefly. So I like this back leg so she's right hand, right foot on. Instead of bringing the left hand up, she does this back leg so that toe is kind of digging and keeping tension and it's keeping her balanced. So now she's kind of got this kind of wide stance, this big triangle as a base. And that's going to let her bounce out. Doing that back leg is going to let her bounce out so she can get that left hand up. And this is especially valuable on a hold like this because it's so flat. She wants as much of her body below the hold because the further away from the wall she is, the more she's going to pull in. And with these flat holds, there's not a whole lot of grip so you kind of want to let the friction and let your body position aid as much as possible.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She's not giving herself an opportunity to even get close to making the layup. So just making sure you're hitting the bag boy high and soft in order to be able to give yourself a better chance at making the layup. And also there's no dribbling. There's no rhythm in the attempt of trying to make the layup. So this is also causing her to be off track. It's causing her to not have that type of fluency into the motion of going to make the layup. The first issue is what's the concept? Is she trying to make a layup? Is she trying to make a reverse layup? So just understanding the concept of what she's attempting to do first and foremost. I think need to be established on this first initial clipboard. I think this angle here just shows right trying to make a layup from straight on is really tough Her posture is going straight forward. She has no angle at coming in To make that layup neither does she have any English on the spin and this is gonna make it even tougher Almost like a zero zero chance at making it The angle she's also taking is super flat. She wanted to be able to come down from a high angle to give herself a better chance at making this layup. And also just understanding if you're going to come off two feet, be able to have that flexion and try to release it at the peak of your jump. She's hitting the backboard really, really hard and obviously she's hitting it outside of the white box, which means she's going to have less of a chance at making the shot. So take a little bit off. You want the ball to hit the backboard as it's going down, not as it's going up. So honestly right now she has zero chance at making a layup due to those three fundamentals that aren't being followed.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I would encourage the dancer to immediately be more grounded in their movement. Again, I would encourage the dancer to be able to ground more because they're doing all this fabulous work in their torso and in their arms and even in their legs, but we're missing that in the hips because there's a lack of range of motion.

So he's going to want his arm bent and really engaged. That way he can kind of pull into it, get his left hand on there as well. Because that's just going to help him hold the swing. So I can't say maybe he has a first step down and that's, you know, hitting the hold. Second step would be holding the hold. A little better. Maybe getting the left hand on.

The player has executed a double scissor, scissor in right, scissor in left, but at the end does not change direction at all. So we would like the player to scissor right to get the defender to go right, scissor left to get the defender to go left, and then when the defender is off balance change direction and head in the opposite direction to the defender is leaning. The player has maintained close control of the ball throughout this last sequence. You can see the ball is in frame in at least this arc at all times. This helps them manipulate the ball better than if the ball was further away in this type of arc. Players executed a little L turn where the ball goes behind the standing leg and out the other way. We'd want the touch now though to be with the outside of the left foot and to continue on in this direction for the next dribbling section. The player has begun a roll over action. I like the distance that they've got here. Really balanced on the right leg. Reaching for the ball with the left foot as far as they can. This adds a lot more deception in the actual moment within the game. The player is trying to execute a little Cruyff type action, however he's made contact with the ball, the ball hasn't really gone anywhere, the ball contact needs to be hard enough so that it pushes the ball back out of his body so that he can then load up the left leg and push away. Players use the inside of their foot instead of the outside. This inside touch has actually brought the ball more narrow when because he was using the alternative beat an opponent we would want him to be going away from that opponent and not back into him. Players dribble has taken three or four or five touches in this area. Every time the ball has stayed close to the body and he's never had to reach for it. Keeping the ball this close helps the player continue to make actions and in a game makes it more difficult for the ball to be stolen from him by a defender. The player is trying to execute a little L-turn with the inside of his right foot. He's moved his left foot too quickly. The ball needed to be rolling a little bit faster so that it cleared this left foot before it moved back. Because the ball hasn't been hit with enough pace and the left foot has moved too quickly, the outcome is this little back heel contact that the player doesn't want. That's going to send the ball behind him and ultimately lose possession. The player has now been able to go into an inside Cruyff, so reversing the ball back across their body, linking the rollover and this action together is impressive for this player. This is a good action. The ball's rolling across the player's body. He's shifted his body weight to the right, loading up his right leg, and is now unloading and pushing his body weight to the right. These two body feints would give the defender really an issue, something to think about, because the fake makes it look like they're going either right or left. Players execute a scissor with their right foot. This is good timing here. Balls rolling at a good speed and the timing of their action to bring their right foot around the ball and plant us was really good. The player has selected a roll over action with the right foot in this moment. However, he's rolling the ball into the corner, an area of less space, and therefore is reducing his time and making the situation more difficult for himself. The scissor action was good but there was no change of direction at the end. We would want the player after the final action of leaning to the left to push the ball away with the outside of their right foot and change speeds to get away from their opponent. So as he's rolled the ball with the left foot, he's managed to plant the left foot quickly. At the same time as the left foot was planting, his right leg moves in behind him. So he maintains the kind of natural left-right, left-right gait. Now the player is loaded up on the left leg, the ball is still rolled across and is now in the perfect position for him to take the ball away with the right foot, really like this. The ball has got stuck under the players feet, you can see how both feet, legs and knees are together. This isn't good for balance and it certainly doesn't allow him to change direction with any speed or explosive power. The ball is really stuck under the body, so in order to move forward the player is going to get the ball out before they can continue on with the dribbling action. Players execute with a small L turn, put their right foot on top of the ball, drag it behind their standing left leg, and then in the same touch, move the ball back across that standing left leg so they can continue the action. They've done this in good control of the ball, eyes on the ball, it's a good action.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He's mainly just pinching and pulling straight down through it But if he kind of meat wraps the side which would be kind of letting his hands and like the meat his hands get around it He's gonna be pulling not only to the right Down that's gonna almost kind of wedge his hand into the hole and provide a little bit extra friction a little bit support And the other thing it does it's gonna leave this right side open for him to match his right hand on and do the exact same thing with this opposite hand And then he stays opposite of pose because he's going to be right hand, left foot, and bumping this left hand up to this pinch guy, this purple thing. It's kind of hard to say what happens here. He's doing a lot of pulling with his arm Kind of looks like he may lose his tension in his core too So it's like I think being more confident with the heel and really pushing down to the heel But also getting this left foot involved and kind of smearing up the wall providing a little tension just to give him a little bit push and Just increase his reach a little bit But just to push his body up a little bit more It's gonna be easier for him to push with his toes and have to pull down with his arm. You'll see his arm is quite aggressively Being used and it's on this kind of slopey pinch guy So it's gonna be extra hard to kind of make the move with just the arm So here we can see him setting this heel hook and that's gonna let him just kind of take a little bit more of the weight to his hands, but I think in order to make the heel hook effective is first grabbing it this this pinch on the left side because now The only open spot is on the left side so he's gonna have to cross it kind of under with his right arm pinch To then move up to the left So it's gonna make the sequence a little bit harder and harder to kind of share that hold and pull from that hold But overall the heel looks a nice idea because it's gonna Let him kind of pull straight down through the hold and it's gonna free up that right arm to do whatever it needs to do Okay, so here he's starting pretty straight armed, but his feet are kind of bunched up so he could kind of flag the right foot out a little bit to provide some counterbalance for when he reaches up with his left hand. So that would kind of look the opposite of what his left hand is doing since he's kind of pulling down with the right arm, toeing down to the left with the left foot. So he's nice and opposite opposed and isn't fighting the position too much. Then he attempts to kind of resituate his grip on this pinch, but just is unable to do so. And then just even to just kind of gasses himself out. I think he then attempts to set a heel hook, which is a good move as well. So by staying opposite of pose, you can kind of stay square to the wall, balance out, keep a little tension, and then bump that left hand up to that pinch. He does a nice little foot swap on this foot, kind of going up the right foot to it first instead of just cutting feet. He gets his one foot up so he can keep tension, then matches the foot, flicks the other foot up to kind of get this left-handed hold again.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Again, I think that he should be using a measuring spoon so he is not over or under seasoning his dish. Here you can see that he is swirling the oil across the entire surface of the pan so that there are no parts of the pan that haven't been touched by the oil. This is again so that he can be certain that the egg does not stick. He successfully flips the omelette over in about a minute and a half after cooking on the first side. The remaining side should only cook for about 30 seconds more for the omelette to be fully cooked through. Next step is to prepare his pan and here he is cutting the electric stove on medium-high heat. He has selected a small omelet pan or skillet to use for this recipe. Once his vegetables are chopped, he does stand up and lift his cutting board off of the table and walks it over to the bowl of eggs that have already been mixed and efficiently he is moving the cut vegetables from the cutting board to the mixing bowl with his knife while his left hand holds the cutting board at a 45 degree angle. He takes a handful of pre-sliced onion, I don't know if this was sliced prior to the video or if it was purchased this way, and begins to dice it. His next step is whisking the eggs together, which he does with this with the same fork. This is an appropriate tool for this particular task. You could also use a wire whisk. He stirs it all to combine and he sprinkles it with what I believe to be a little bit of salt. Obviously I would recommend he use a measuring spoon here so he knows exactly how much seasoning he is adding to his dish. He grabs a very small pepper from this bag, produce bag, and begins to thinly slice it after sitting back down. I do think that one of the challenges that he's having with using his knife is because he is seated instead of standing. He does fold the omelet in half, which is actually a classic way of serving the omelet. At this point the omelet is cooked though, so he should remove it from the pan and put it on his serving plate. Using this thin curved spatula, otherwise known as a fish spatula, he is going around the outside of the omelette to make sure that the edges are not sticking. Here you can see he gives it a little bit of a shake. This is to ensure that the edges are not sticking and to try to get the omelette in a single even layer so that it cooks evenly. And this pressing motion that he's doing is not actually really cutting, he's just randomly chopping away at the onions in order to try to get them into smaller pieces. He puts his hand directly over the pan's surface so that he can tell if it's hot enough. He could also do this by sprinkling a little bit of water from the tap into the pan and if it sizzles that means that it is ready. The first step in cooking an omelette is to gather all of your ingredients and the tools that you will need to complete the recipe from start to finish. You can see here that he has a mixing bowl set aside, a cutting board, and a knife back here at his workspace. He adds about a tablespoon of canola oil directly to the pan. Again, he should be measuring this. However, he could use any type of oil, butter, or pan spray. This is in an effort to ensure that when he adds the omelet to the pan, it does not stick to the bottom. I can't be certain what that last seasoning was, but again, he should be measuring these ingredients instead of just eyeballing it. The last step is to transfer the omelette from his skillet into onto the serving platter, which he does here with relative ease. You can see here that his knife skills are below average. He doesn't have a very clear understanding of the most efficient or effective technique to do this task. He has his index finger out on the blade of the knife to balance it, I guess. You should always hold the handle of the knife like you would just a normal handle, not with your finger out. And then also his left hand, he has all of his fingers out trying to guide the onion towards the knife. He is obviously putting himself in danger of injury if the knife should slip. He adds his omelet mixture directly to the pan when he feels that it is hot enough. Once that task is complete, he is ready to prep his vegetables. It is strange that he is sitting down while doing this task. It would be preferable to be standing at a countertop or a different workspace, not seated in a chair. He flips it one or two more times. I don't know if this is just for color or if it's because he is unsure of actually when the omelet is done, but it's fully cooked now. He cracks open a single egg with the edge of a fork and with his two thumbs spreads the egg directly into the mixing bowl.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

So the pinch is going to allow for optimal control of this hold and is the primary grip for this start position, whereas this half crimp is going to allow the climber to pull diagonally and progress up and left on this boulder.

This super low foot requiring a ton of tension and making the climber have to put a ton of weight into this right hand as well, because this left hand seems pretty useless.

He should be extending it with more energy. His arm should be straight at some point and have energy through his fingers. His fingers are a bit dead here. There's not energy radiating outward. So if he is gonna accentuate his arm like that and emphasize it by extending forward, he really does then need to fully engage and use his energy to extend his arm forward. The way in which his chin is placed here now when he's looking straight forward is much better. Now his spine is vertically aligned with his head upright. He barely sees the floor in the screen. He sees much more of the rest of the room including the curtain and higher. This is where his eye focus should be. The dancer has a moment in which he gazes downward here. He sees a bunch of the floor in the screen. His head should be upright, his chin should be picked up, and he should be focusing straight forward. This is another opportunity here when the dancer is doing these steps in place for him to be engaging his hips and moving them sideways. It is okay for the dancer to extend his arm forward here in this punch position when he's stepping Forward right before he does a revolution around It's just once he finishes that turn. He shouldn't be then extending continue to extend his arm in this up punching position The dancer extends his right arm forward here a bit of a punch position, which is awkward. It's not necessary His arms shouldn't be extended forward like this. They should be bent inward And alternating one higher and lower not extended forward like this The dancer isn't really lifting his feet here. He's barely picking them off the floor, sometimes not picking them off the floor at all, so he should articulate his footwork more here by picking his feet off the floor. He doesn't need to be marching by any means, but his feet should be lifted and then placed back onto the floor. This is really good shoulder movement here, how he's accentuating his shoulder with each foot tap he does forward. It'd be wonderful if he continued to engage his shoulders like this and even more movement because this mobility here is very good.

That very first step, stepping out to the side, he has this habit of looking downwards during. He should make sure to keep his chin at level and looking straight forward. The dancer also doesn't move his hips or engage his hips here. He should be moving his hips horizontally right and left with each step that he takes. So if he's stepping with his right foot, he should be moving his hips to the left and vice versa.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Now in this case climber generated so much power and coordination from down below where once generated the power the climber had a huge swing. This is a bit difficult as the climber you know if there is a big swing then the climber will not be able to hold on to the hold above. So it's important to know how much of power the climber is generating before getting on to the hold. As this is a dynamic movement the climber needs to make an efficient movement and also make it less physical or taxing. In this case this made climber potentially not being able to grip the hold enough due to the power generated on the swing. Here we can see the climber rocking back and forth and this so that the climber can secure the feet and also generate power when making the movement up from the pull up to the next move up. Now the climber right now when rocks back and forth is transferring weight first to the right foot that is placed the highest and then when the climber is down below it uses the left foot and then once the climber gets to stand up and create a dynamic move up to the next hold the climber will be pressing down on the left foot first and then bringing his hips over the highest foot being the right then to move up their hand as they stand up on the right foot. Here's a point of the climber to visualize the wall before starting the climb. Now we can see the climber performing some hand gestures, which this will help the climber have an idea of what the sequence of his hands movements will be when on the wall. Here we can see the climber going up for a dyno. This is where the climber needs to really make a commitment on knowing exactly where the hold is going to be held. This one in this case the climber thought of the right hand going up and exactly wanting to place the hand where he has it. Now the dynamic move comes out with a lot of force as the climber was squatting transferring the weight from the foot left to right and once the climber was ready by doing a sprint up to the hold the climber once gets to stick the hand onto the hold then the body will dynamically want to pendulum out of the wall due to the force. So the climber in order to sustain the grip will must to is not only create pressure generated from the open hand grip that the climber has in this moment but it would also need to bring their chest forward and try to use your core to bring their feet back onto the wall to avoid peeling off the wall. Here we can see the climber starting at a two-hold start hold. Each hand has a donut, is a type of hold that the climber is holding on to, and to create pressure the climber is pinching it using all of their hand to create the pinch. The climber also needs to generate a lot of power while hanging on to it and does this by leaning back. Also leaning back is called the rest position and can help the climber keep power or not get so tired when having the arms extended and only engaging the grips as the climber makes the placement onto the wall for the feet. Now once the feet are on the wall and the climbers off the mat then the climber starts.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

On the right hand he's holding on to a pinch so he has to aim the elbow away to the right side since the climber is standing right underneath the grips. Simpsons the climber was struggling on the grips and reason why the climber hasn't stepped off from the wall. The climber was going to do this again. He needs to make sure that he aims where the next move will be and as the left hand is placed as a mono, the climber is keeping the left hand as an undercling which this can be a powerful grip and in order to keep it in place the climber then eventually will have to bring the elbow close to the core when making the stance up to the next move. Heel hooks are powerful and as we can see the climber was able to engage into a forceful stance. This one engaging all of the standing power onto that right heel being placed. Once the climber was able to bring his center of gravity as close as he can to his right foot being the area of support, the climber also engages in a forceful pull up. This is called a lock off. In order for the climber to keep himself in that position, his left leg is extended behind the right leg being in position. The climber is tapping the toe against the wall. This is to sustain position while making the reach. As this was a wide hand placement, we can see the climber securing the grip on the left hand on a jug, meaning that the climber is able to place the fingers inside the hold, being able to have a positive grip, pulling away from the hold to create pressure. Now, the climber glances down at the feet because he must do a foot switch. Now, because the left leg being up kept the climber too cramped over, so in order to release some pressure down at the feet, the climber must pull tight on the grips. And the climber needs to make a quick foot switch because of the crunched up position, but also needs to make sure he is applying pressure with the foot coming in before he releases the left foot out of place. The climber is starting at a one hand hold start. As we see, both hands are placed onto the same hold and this is called matching. The climber is starting on a sit start, meaning that this will add a grade to the climb, since sit starts are difficult to come up from because the climber, once places the feet on the wall, he will need to raise his hips, applying weight into the limbs. Now that the climber has secured the grip on the right hand, the climber keeps the arm extended. This creates some pressure at the grips. The climber then brings the left foot to come into place to the area of where the heel hook is placed. It's important that the climber releases the heel hook with control as they create a lot of pressure on the pull and it's acting as a third hand in this instance. So the climber once creates pressure with the toe being in place into the hold, the climber is able to release the right foot from place. The climber quickly has made the right foot to come up to a higher stance. This one by placing the heel in first against the wall. The climber places it also above the edge of the whole foothold. In this case the climber is going glancing over to the next hold. So in order to make this reached move the climber is extending the arms to bring it to a rest and it's important the climber knows how to grip and hold position before committing to the move. As the left leg is extended, fold it behind it, hold behind the right leg. This is called flagging which the climber will then tap the toe in order to keep himself in position once he is up for the stance. While the climber was sustaining the jog with the match, the climber had blindly made a foot switch. This by making a feel of the left foot coming into place next to the right toe and quickly has placed the right foot onto a higher stance. Sending the heel into the wall so that the climber is able to use it as a heel hook for the next move. As we can see, the climber is making some hand gestures. This is because the climber is visualizing the wall. And creating the hand gestures will help the climber have an idea on what to expect on sequence when making the moves before getting onto the wall. It's important that the climber continues to pull on the monohull in order to create pressure. Right now the climber needs to glance over at the feet to fix the stance, as the climber will need to continue the rest of the climb, and keeping the arms bended for a long period of time can tire the climber's grip. As we can see the climber releases the right hand to bring it over to a match at the jug. For foot placement the climber has sent the left leg to be extended and this one is used for him to flagging in and has tapped the toe against the wall so that he can keep position when making the transfer of the hand over to the next grip. Here we can see how the climber is off to a start. This is because his body is no longer on the mat. As we can see the climber is glancing over to the left side and in order for him to achieve going out left he will have to send his left hand out for the next hold. For him to get direction the climber must sustain the left foot in place being the highest one and would have to keep a wide stance when making the move out left. To support the direction of the move the climber will have to press down on the right foot against the wall and extend the leg to support the reach. The climber here is shaking his hands. This will help the climber release any tension that has been built up. Also, shaking them will help the climber to have a slight warm up and regain energy for the climber to have a better grip when on the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So here she's doing kind of a little chasse, so kind of like a gallop forward and back with the kick and then a ball change step back. I think finally by this point she is getting the rhythm of it. She's doing a pretty decent job staying on the beat. But really again committing to the step and not trying to cut any step off but doing the step fully so her body can fully just understand what she's trying to do. And again I would say as some sort of arms the upper body is still very stiff to match the movement of the legs. The dancer starts with rock step, triple step, triple step, and she's doing it around in a circle. Right at the moment right before this freeze, she kind of stumbled a little bit. And I think it's because her body appears very tense. So really in this swing era, like loosening up your body, letting everything go would help a lot. And just letting your upper body naturally do what it's going to do in reaction to your feet. She does do a good job moving around the space, but getting flustered and mixed up is I think it's because she's not letting go of her body and just trusting the steps. Because she's repeating the steps over and over again. So just really trusting your body and doing what it's going to do. So here she's doing again just the rock step triple step and I think she's getting off the timing because her energy is not staying consistent with the music so she kind of builds her energy up I think would help her to not get off beat so much and she would just really stay on the beat if she just brought up a little bit more energy. I also feel like she's really heavy on her feet so I would suggest maybe pushing up on her toes a little bit more to be a little bit lighter bending her knees a little bit more when she is doing the triple steps because it does feel like she's just really heavy and weighted to the floor.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The violinist can just practice very slowly to make sure that they know where their fingers are going. They can also practice with the tuner to help see if they're in tune or not. This chord that they're playing starts really crunchy because their weight in their hand is not all the way down to pull down the strings. The violins are getting a really nice sound because they're keeping their bows straight in parallel with the bridge. This is another example that they're playing with their pads of their fingers. If they used more of their fingertips, they'd get more clarity in this section. Right now it sounds a bit muddy. The violinist isn't getting the most clarity here. They're playing with flat fingers. This also is affecting their intonation a bit. If they can play with their fingertips, they'll get more clarity and have more accuracy with their left hand. When playing this note, the violinist has this approach that they're coming from above, and it doesn't sound super coordinated. It'd be best, even for a split second, to put the hair on the string first, and then pull the bow. If they were playing on the pad of their finger, they could get more clarity in their sound if they played more on the fingertip. The violins are doing a gliss slide with their finger, keeping the string as they go down. Stylistically, they could make it a little bit more longer and gooier to make it seem more romantic. There's a brief scratch in the sound because the left hand and the right hand are not coordinated. The left hand should be leading to make sure that the string is down and then the bow can follow. This is another example for these shorter notes, that the violins is using too much bow. They can have a more compact amount of bow, and they'll have more clarity for these smaller notes. These fast notes would have come across a little bit clearer if they used a smaller amount of bow, so it's more condensed. They missed the shift here. In order for it to be better, they can just practice going from their current position to their past position multiple times to really measure the shift and feel comfortable with the hand is going. The violinist is able to do this exercise decently well, but it would serve them well to slow this down and be very aware of their finger motions. This note isn't in tune. The player can use a tuner to help get a better idea of the right pitch. When performing this technical exercise, it's really important to have curved fingers so you're really playing with the fingertip. The violinists could get better clarity if they were able to do this. This phalanx is doing a good job playing closer to the frog. In order to get there, they're also utilizing their upper arm, bringing it a little bit over, so that they can play with more weight, especially on the G-string. This section is losing a little bit of its clarity. You can see that they're using the pads of their fingers. Perhaps if they brought their elbow just a little bit further around, they can get more on their fingertips to get more clarity. They're doing a really nice job of this section using a full amount of bow to get the best sound also while traversing all these string crossings. This note, they could have actually launched the note a little bit sooner here for more of a stylistic approach. For these shorter notes, the violinist is using too much bow. If they used lesser amount of bow, it would be better for coordination between the left hand and the right hand. The violinist is still playing with some flat fingers, more on the pad. If they can play more with their fingertips, they'll be able to enter the string faster and leave it faster, which will result in more clarity and better coordination. They're getting a really excellent sound by having the bow being parallel with the bridge. They're also using a nice balance of weight and speed to get the string to ring. Here's another example with these fast ones that they're playing the left hand, that they could use a smaller amount of bow for it to come across more clearly. When playing on the E string, they're doing a good job of utilizing their forearm and opening up from their elbow.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

You can see the left hand fingers are curved and pressing firmly in the frets, and they are playing with great pitch and rhythmic accuracy. The guitarist is performing this scale pattern with great rhythmic and pitch accuracy at a consistent tempo. Each pitch is sounding nice and clear. The guitarist is continuing to curve their left hand fingers and press firmly on the strings and towards the center of each fret that is needed to play the pitches in this pattern. Here the placement of the left hand pinky could be adjusted again. It is pressing on top of the metal bar and should be pressing more towards the center of the fret to get a clearer sound. Here the pitch played by the pinky was a bit muted and not as clear as it could be as the pinky was released a little bit too quickly. It could have been planted more firmly for a bit longer to get a clearer sounding pitch. They are now performing the same major scale in two octaves with a different articulation. They are playing their notes staccato or more short and separated. Here, a pitch was skipped at first. The guitarists quickly pressed their pinky down and played the pitch that was missing before playing this pitch with their second finger again to correct this mistake. They again increase their tempo and are playing with great pitch and rhythmic accuracy and also a clear tone quality. Even at this fast challenging tempo, they are playing their pattern repeatedly and accurately. The aim of the right hand fingers is great. The guitarist is doing an excellent job at playing their finger style pattern at a very fast, rapid tempo. The guitarist is reattempting this scale again.

The guitarist is doing a great job playing their repeating finger style pattern. The right hand fingers are playing each string individually. They're not bumping into any extra strings, so they are getting a nice clear sound to each pitch and the right hand fingers are curved while playing this pattern.

You can see they are continuing to demonstrate excellent left hand position. The left hand fingers are curved over the fretboard. The thumb is on the back of the neck of the guitar. The guitarist is continuing to play their alternating strumming pattern accurately. They are alternating between using the pointer finger and the middle finger to play each pitch in the scale. The last two pitches that were performed were also muted. You can see that the pointer finger on the left hand is pressing directly on this metal bar, which is affecting the sound quality. It would help to press this finger more towards the center of the fret and curve it a bit more to get clearer sound. It would also help to curve and press the second finger down more towards the center of its fret to get a clearer sound on that pitch as well. They are continuing to shift to the higher frets with ease and they are continuing to get a nice clear Beautiful sound quality even on these higher pitches that are being played here They are now performing their same scale with a legato articulation again, but at a much faster tempo.

His feet are moving efficiently, but they're not quite moving with the rhythm underneath him. They're kind of moving in a very pedestrian, almost kind of confused manner. If you were to be able to find more clarity in this transition, by keeping his movements small and tight and really paying attention to the rhythm and the music, he would be able to execute it more efficiently. As the dancer performs some jumping variations of the Charleston, he continues to struggle keeping the arms engaged and the upper body engaged. Overall, his upper body appears quite stiff and kind of locked in position. His lower body is able to move freely and execute the step. However, he really loses his connection to the rhythm as he performs this bigger movement as compared to the rock step and the triple step prior. So if he were to keep his jumps a little bit smaller and find some more clarity in the working leg, particularly during those kicking movements, he would be able to connect more deeply to the rhythm and maintain that connection to the music. The dancer is starting to find more movement in his arms here, however his movement in his arms appears to be mimicking that of if he had a partner. So for example if he was dancing with another person here, he appears to reach his arm out in a way that's characteristic of holding hands with a partner in dancing. Which shows that he has an understanding of the movement technique, however he doesn't have the advanced knowledge of the movement to be able to choreograph arms for a solo performance. He's really leaning on what probably he might know prior to this, which is a partner performance. So he would benefit from finding more clarity as a soloist, particularly in the movement of his arms here. As the dancer starts to find more confidence in his movements, particularly as he's changing facings, he's able to connect slightly to the rhythm here and he's able to find a lot more clarity in his lower body, particularly in the movement of his feet and also the facing of his body overall. Where he would benefit here is from adding some more arm choreography. The arms have stayed pretty stagnant throughout the entire performance, as well as his upper body. He's quite stiff through the shoulders and the back. If he were to add some more choreography, particularly in the upper body, and loosen up that pelvis a little bit, he would be able to execute the choreography more fully, as well as with a little bit more efficiency and connection to the music. As the dancer is performing a series of basic rock steps and triple steps, which is characteristic of swing dance movement, he is able to really catch the rhythm in the triple steps in particular. However, he's struggling to move through his rock steps as quickly as the music might call for. He would just benefit from some more clarity and some more efficiency in his movement. As the dancer is continuing to perform a series of basic steps, he starts to get really, really thrown off both the music and the technical elements of the step. He appears to be performing a series of shuffles where he's taking his feet from this wide stance and bringing them in closer together in more of a scooting or a chugging motion rather than defining that rock step and the triple step movement. He would benefit from overall just finding more clarity in his movement here, taking a moment to breathe and refocus his energy because right now his movement feels very sporadic, it feels a little bit all over the place and it feels like it's lacking that technical clarity. As the dancer is performing these series of kicks that are somewhat similar to a Charleston, but also somewhat freestyle here, he's really struggling with his directionality and finding a lot of clarity in his movement. And he's struggling with this because this working leg that's performing the kicks is really leading the movement, rather than his torso and his pelvis leading the movement. He's letting his leg really take that energy so that he shifts facings from one direction to another, rather than leading with his torso to make that shift, which is throwing him off the music quite significantly and making his movements appear very reactionary, rather than as one cohesive performance. If he were to really utilize his torso and clarify his movements in his lower body, he would be able to connect more deeply to the music, as well as execute the step more efficiently. As the dancer is continuing to perform a series of basic swing movements, he's able to execute the movements fairly efficiently through his lower body, though he could use some refinement and some more deep embodiment of the rhythm. However, his upper body feels pretty stagnant. He would benefit from some added arm choreography. You can see his arms are just kind of tightly positioned and bent close to the torso. And his upper body through the shoulders and the spine particularly is quite stiff. If he were to loosen up his upper body a little bit more and incorporate some more specific arm choreography, it would really benefit him.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And then he's stepping and crossing in front and stepping out to the side. So in the beginning he is stepping in place. He does a good job picking his feet up off the floor. Maybe bend the knees a little bit more, but good job just stepping in place. So overall for a basic choreography, this dancer is able to just do all the steps really cleanly and go through each transition really well, so this is a really good example for basic. So here he's taking some toe taps forward and then also kind of bouncing his shoulders as well as reaching his arms out to the front. And now he's stepping out to the side.

The guy in the pink did a little spin and connected hands again and I feel like their feet are a little loud so they can definitely walk a bit softer so they're not quite stomping around. So here they, he's swinging the guy in the black around while still keeping the same correct rhythm. So nice shot there with a nice space in between. The eyes are still connected, which is nice. And also the hands are connected. So here a much better job at coming back together just with some heel steps forward. So the step is leading with the heel of the foot and they are again mirroring each other with the opposite leg. So here they're just kind of doing a bit of side waves of their body moving side to side as they kind of step and move back and forth. So not bad, just more improvised than actual choreography. I think here it's getting a little flustered because they're not quite mirroring each other. They're not quite using the same legs. So this where it looks a bit more improvised. So I think they just kind of need to reconnect and make sure they're stepping together. So here they are stepping together and they look like a mirror so nice job there keeping the beat and moving together. So I think it may help if they talk through the movement so they know what movement is coming next. And I think that would help them to transition better throughout the different movements. So here he's spinning the guy in the black around while still kind of doing this ball change triple step, the rock step triple step, and keeping the rhythm as best as they can. So here they start to lose the rhythm a bit, but they are still keeping the eye contact, which is really important to stay connected in a partnering dance. So here they're doing the rock step triple step around in a circle, but still staying together nicely.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So that's how I would like to see the dancer's waist, from the waist down moving with the hips, on certain steps, to see that kind of engagement with isolation in that direction. Arms should really be moving more naturally versus them being placed into a particular position. At that point too, when the movement is, where the arms are here and they're going up and down, I'd like to see the arms moving more like this, back and forth, rather than the arms moving more like this, up and down. Because the movement should really come from the shoulders. That comes from the center of the body. It really shouldn't be a hand gesture or an arm gesture, but more about the torso moving the shoulders there. Because the shoulders are actually what we wanna see in the isolations. It's not a hand movement or an elbow or an arm movement. The dancers should shift in the hips a little bit more. So if this were the hips, the lower part of the body should be moving, swiveling. So almost like if you're holding on to a, I don't know, like, what's a good example?", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They can move really fast but be in control of their body placement which is super important so they can do this by one grounding of course breath control and engaging their abdominal. I would encourage the dancer to really think about using their hips as well as their rib cage, not just moving from their extremities. This is a moment where grounding would help them transition between one step to the next. I would encourage the dancer to again think about placement of the arms and using the power throughout the back to communicate through the arms and through the fingertips and really being very careful about where to place the body so it looks the Movement looks clean and not sloppy I would also encourage the dancer to really study the intricate movements in the rhythm because sometimes they're a little bit off of the beat or they're having a hard time transitioning from one beat to the next.

This is just some left-right-left movement after the jug, nothing technically demanding of the climber, just pulling and grabbing and moving the left hand and the right hand. Here the climber perches over this left foot and continuing to drive through the right. They find a body position where they're able to, at least for a short time, put their full weight on this right pinch. That allows them to get into this pretty small left-hand crimp here. So we have a left hand on this jug-like hold here. This is a cool start. The climber back steps this orange foothold down here and kind of hops up into this right hand and now they're in the start position of the boulder here. Kramer then bumps up into this undercling and is able to get the right foot up here and the left foot staying where it was. Kramer is able to stand up into that undercling and get a match and top the boulder. And the climber is then able to maintain the same positions and get into this hold first with their right and then match with their left. This is what is known in climbing as a thank you God hold, which is I guess a little bit tongue in cheek, but nevertheless, it's used pretty widely. It's just a really good rest position after a stressful situation before. It's a place where the climber can recollect and set some new intentions if needed.

Again, the hesitation there, the pause will allow a defender in a game situation to match up with you. But this looks good. I get the shooting hand a little bit behind the ball, but I love the soft, token pressure of the guide hand. Again, see the small little steps, he's standing straight up. Let's drop those knees and hips. Great extension, follow through. Let's again spread those fingers. Love the guide hand, palm facing in. Let's get this elbow in. Good extension of the hips. He's going up on the balls of his feet. Would love to see a little more lift from this player. Beautiful extension here. This is really, really good. I might spread those fingers just a tad, get this elbow in, but good extension. He releases the ball at the height of his jump, which is good, and the ball's got some arc on it, which is you want it to go up. Again, he's just standing straight up, just bending the knees and getting ready and meet this pass. Again, he's getting his hands ready, which is really, really good. You know, and then when he does catch it, there's a little bit of a hesitation. You see his feet are kind of close together. You know, in a game, a situation, again, I mean, if you don't catch and get rid of this ball quickly, I mean, it's \u2013 you're not going to get the shot off. So let's be ready. Let's drop those hips, run and catch that \u2013 meet that pass and shot. Again, this is why I gave him a seven or eight. In this drill, ideally, you know, you want to make it as game-like as possible, so you've got to really meet this pass. And by doing that, I mean, you know, I call it be a ready shooter. Let's drop those knees, hips, and then step in and meet this pass with a one-two step, or in some cases, people may go run up and catch it and do what's called a jump stop or a two-foot takeoff. But he's just standing straight up, waiting for the ball to come to him. In a game situation, a defender's going to step in and steal this pass if you don't meet this pass. So let's practice it in this setting. Again, just to kind of like a little pause here. We'd really love him to step with that left foot to catch the ball, followed by the right, and use that foot placement to really lift your body up. Again, beautiful extension of the shooting arm, breaking of the wrist, fingers point down, the guide hand is on the side, really, really good here. I love the trajectory of the ball going to the rim. He's extended his hips, really, really nice. Nice look here, good extension, the attempt to hold that follow-through. I'd love to see him spread his fingers out a little bit, but overall really good. Again, he may turn a little sideways here. It's hard to see it from this angle. You know, again, that's just, you know, we want to square or face our body to the rim. Really good touch here, really see that guide hand come off the ball right before you shoot it. Nice job. Here's the extension. Again, really, really good here. You know, I'd get those elbows in just a tad, but overall really, really good. He's leaving the floor a little bit. I feel like he could get more power and elevate and lift more with a little more readiness. Again, great lift of the ball. You can see the ball sitting back on the fingers here. Really nice. Let's get that guide elbow in somewhat. Here the shooter is shooting a 15-footer. Pretty good touch and form here, as you can see in the EGO view. That beautiful extension of the right shooting arm. Just beautiful here. Breaking of the wrist, snapping down of the fingers. That guide hand is on the side. I might move that elbow in a little bit so that forearm is parallel to the floor. But overall, really, really good here. Great, good extension here. He's got his feet apart. Eyes and head are up. Again, here's his position as he waits for this pass. That's why I've given him a score of an eight. I really, ideally would love for him to prepare. And I've mentioned all that before. See his hands down. Let's be ready. That's part of being a great shooter is your readiness, your preparation to catch the ball. Here's the lift, again, really nice. But overall he's got, you know, he dips the knees, he's getting ready to jump a little bit, let's get those shooting elbows in under the ball, but this looks really good here with his hand back behind the ball. Here's the landing, balls in the air, beautiful trajectory here for it to go up and in, you know, but what you don't see is his follow-through. He, you know, he drops his follow-through, his arm, right arm down, kind of turns a little sideways or inward. We want to keep our hips and shoulders square and let's extend that right arm in our follow-through. And ideally, you know, a lot of times we hold the follow-through till it hits backboard rim or swishes. Again, he's still waiting for the ball. He does extend his hands out to catch it, which is really good. It looks like he's getting ready to backstop it with his right hand, which is really, really good. That guide hand is where it needs to be to help guide it into this right hand for the shot. But again, let's get our feet apart. Let's drop our knees and our hips and really, really explode into this pass in one motion, catch and shoot. Again, as he prepares to lift, right foot slightly in front. That's what you want to see with a right-hand shooter. He's got the ball sitting on the back of his pads of his fingers, which are not your fingertips and it's not the palm of your hand. I would get that shooting elbow in just a little bit under the ball. You want this elbow to be under the hand. It's out here a little bit. That's being really picky. Again, let's get that guide arm elbow parallel to the floor. I really feel like this guy can jump a lot higher by preparing a little bit and being ready, what I call a ready shooter, to catch and shoot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So you see a lot of different steps, so a nice diversity of the steps that the dancer is executing and also playing with the music a bit. So there are steps like the twisting in the hips, the shifting, and maybe going to the box step that are appropriate along with the music that they hear. So they're doing a lot of stepping out, the dancer is shifting and the way and really allowing themselves to move quite freely in the space because they are moving with a grounded sense of self, they are moving with bent knee, they are isolating and moving with I would say ease and clarity and execution so you know what the dancer is doing from one step to the next. The dancer is reaching up into the air and bringing their arms around when they are doing this step, stepping from side to side, so they have a very nice, clear execution of their arms in terms of being aware of where the arms are going, the direction that they're taking their arms in and dancing that full out. It seems that the dancer is very clear about the movement they're doing and where their body is being placed and where it is going. The dancer's doing really nice footwork and knee work and changing levels here, which was quite dynamic and playing with the music. So the dancer was bending the knee and almost kicking the leg out to shift to the other side and using the arms to help pull and thrust the body up from the floor. And using, I would say, the dancer's core strength to keep control of the body when they were doing these level changes. The dancer also had a very nice use of the floor space, moving from left to right across the floor and taking up space and not staying in one place, which was also nice to see. The dancer does a great job of executing the Charleston. The dancer is even engaging in some level changes and really flaps the arms and the feet. It really is engaged and has a great rhythm with this step and also is staying in tempo with the step, not twisting or shifting in the hips at all, but being stationary in the waist and really just putting the movement into the knees and the feet and the arms that are swaying back and forth and then moving a little bit forward, rocking back and forth as the dance step progresses. Dancer is doing a nice job of also anticipating the music and where the breaks in the music are so that they can play around with different steps. And so that is a nice dynamic the dancer is adding there. And so that is a nice dynamic the dancer is adding there. Dancer is doing a great job as well when the music does change. The singer changes, the tempo changes, the instruments are changing, the dance changes from one song to the next. The dancer very quickly adapts to that new tempo and keeps time with the music and even starts to execute movement that has a different energy and flow but also will bring up the tempo, increase the tempo if the song is also increasing. So it's not just the speed of the step but it's then where the dancer executes a step that has a little bit of a different energy that matches the music that just got changed. Dancers are doing a great job shifting from the box step into doing some swings. And while this might be improvised, the dancer is still making sure that they are executing the movement on both sides of the body, on the right side and the left side, to really complete the phrasing as well as keeping the beat and not really losing that tempo, that beat, that rhythm when they go to shift in the steps or the phrasing or the different combination of steps.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

One of the reasons why I can think that might be an idea for the climber is because the right side of the undercling hold might feel a little bit better. So this would probably encourage the climber to try and hang onto it in the first place. But by getting herself in this cross position, the next move afterwards is what's making it really hard for her to be able to complete any further movement from here. Because what ends up having to happen is as the climber reaches for that hold and wants to move from it, they need to make sure they transition all their bodyweight over onto that left foot. And in the way it is right now, a lot of her bodyweight is kind of placed more over to the right. So it is a large distance and a great area that she has to transition her bodyweight around in order to actually use that right hand hold. So with that, the climber does realize very quickly that this is a very difficult move to complete and does move back to that matching of the start hold. So it's nice to see that the climber is trying to figure out some different movement here. But I would definitely encourage the climber to spend her time off of the wall to try and figure out her movements. So then that way she can commit to a single move because we can see that the climber has been hanging on this wall for a long time, which does use up a lot of energy very quickly. And so here we can see now she's attempting to try and reach over with the left hand and trying to pull in an outwards fashion. So by pulling in this outwards fashion, this is what we call a gaston when you're pulling in an outside direction. So this does make it a very powerful move by utilizing a gaston. But one thing that I'm seeing with this climber is with the direction of her left knee kind of going in an internal rotation, that actually helps to push her body weight over to the right. So she's kind of counteracting her movements right here because her arm wants to pull outwards, but her leg is pushing her over to the right. So she's kind of working against herself right here, but shortly afterwards, her left foot does slide off. So again, I would just recommend to this climber to step off the wall, really figure out exactly what type of move she wants to commit to. And then when she has something in mind, then at that point to get on the wall and try and commit to that move. So then that way she can kind of conserve her energy because by going back and forth while on the wall, this does use up a lot of energy very quickly and could make it very difficult to complete the boulder overall.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I would encourage the dancer when they do that hit hit hit to make sure they drop their pelvis all the way to almost all the way to the ground when their arms are shooting out here to create different levels and greater dynamic qualities to this advanced choreography. I would again encourage this dancer to release their shoulders so they don't look a little more less awkward and they feel like their chest is communicating with the audience. Overall, the dancer has really great energy and really great attack of the movement. I would encourage them to one ground, be more precise, as well as incorporate their center, meaning incorporate their hip articulation and their ribcage articulation. The dancer sometimes slips and slides in their sneakers and lose balance. So a way to avoid that is one, to engage the core. Second, to really drive that foot into the ground and be sure about where to place the weight. So the choreography always looks clean and precise. I would encourage the dancer to make sure that they drop that pelvis because they do a really good job of being engaged in their torso.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As the dancer performs a series of slight jumps where she's crossing one leg here in this instance It's her right leg crossing over her left leg. She appears very pedestrian in her movements She really lacks any sort of connection to the rhythm And really doesn't perform any sort of specific arm choreography. You can see her arms are in a very pedestrian manner Situated in a very pedestrian manner here Overall, she doesn't appear to be performing any sort of specific Embodied rhythm here, and she also appears very frantic and pedestrian perhaps additional practice of the choreography would be beneficial As the dancer performs a series of step touches, touching this one foot out in front of her and then bringing it back to meet in the middle and alternating feet, she's able to maintain a connection to the rhythm, particularly through her feet. However, the rest of her body from her knees up is really disengaged. She's not performing any specific choreography and is not really engaging with the rhythm in any significant way. Here the dancer starts to incorporate some audible movements which includes some snapping of her fingers and a clap. However, the snapping of her fingers and the clapping really demonstrate how disconnected she is from the rhythm. She also has a slight bounce happening in her knees which is really disconnected from the rhythm as well and not a lot of engagement happening through her shoulders, her spine, and her pelvis which is making her appear quite stiff as she's performing the movement. As the dancer performs a swaying motion back and forth, alternating between crossing her legs over herself and changing her facing slightly, she stays slightly connected to the rhythm, however she really starts to lose the connection when she performs this swaying step. If she were to bend her knees more and drop her pelvis back, as well as engage her upper body in a meaningful way, she would be able to stay more connected to the rhythm here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He has become accustomed to those and so it it's semi-efficient for him But to really bring his playing up to the next level. We would want to really kind of go back to those basics and Working hands independently and really strengthening those muscles to function the way that With Those curved up fingers to make it a little bit more fluid in his playing and to help him go into the next level All right, the pianist is starting out. He has a pretty good posture and arm position and hand position in relation to the piano. We are seeing, starting with arpeggios, you can see how the pianist is jumping here instead of kind of turning and tucking to go to the next or crossing over to go to the next octave. He's just lifting his hand in general and so working on some of those turns would be helpful. So, again, it's just memory with the key, and so I would recommend probably going by around the circle of fifths, so that you go from the key of C to the key of G, adding one sharp to the key of D, adding another sharp, so then you get to two sharps, to the key of A, three sharps, to the key of E, four sharps. Because when you play that way, it's a lot easier to remember where you're at, and those arpeggio patterns, and rather than, you know, when you move up chromatically, it is a little bit more difficult to remember on the fly, you know, when you're going through quickly, where your sharps and flats are. So while shifting rather than turning, that even though it's just slight, it does create a bit of hesitation before playing the next section. And so that is the benefit of using that. You know, you want to stretch and turn and we want to practice that. So by playing, you know, like finger one, one, two, three, and then tucking the thumb as you're rolling up allows you to kind of get those there and practice that. So you would practice a one, two, three, one, and then you do that again. One, two, three, one, one, two, three, one. And then one once that feels comfortable, then you would want to add the one, two, three, one, two into the next phrase and making that. And so as you finish the second arpeggio, the second octave, one, two, three, one, two, three, five, three, two, one, cross, three, two, one. And that would kind of help with that overall flow of those arpeggios. So rather than a progressive exercise it is Kind of a lift and separate or separate and lift in that area and so Yeah, I would just kind of encourage him to work on each hand in independently so that You can kind of work out where that where those Turns are gonna be His fingers are rather straight and so we want to kind of work on that hand position Nice and curved into the C cup position Which allows your fingers to be at the same Length hitting each of the keys", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Because she was already low, when she did the previous movement where she was pumping and twisting her right knee in and then pumping her left arm, because she was already so close to the floor, she's able to easily bend this left knee down to slide in, which she did a nice little clean slide into the next part. So I've learned that when you are ready to go down to the floor, for people who it may be hard to go from a high level or a medium level to the floor, the lower you are right before you get down, the easier it is going to be to transition. And she did a really nice, smooth transition from a squatting position into the floor on one knee. All right, and that last little eight count, really good, again, sticking to the music, hearing the melody, hearing the beats, and hitting the accents with her movements. A really strong finish, those arms are nice and high and lifted. This leg is straight, the toe is pointed. She's pushing into her right hip to the side, and the head is leveled and looking straight forward. So, a really nice finish for this piece. All right, the part right before this, it's the dun-dun-dun-dun. Really nice with the music, musicality of that part. I would have shook a little harder, but really good sticking directly with the music and making it really clear for the next part. So here she just, her energy kind of gets a little bit more elevated. She punches forward, taking two steps to punch forward and then punching out to the side. Again, her energy definitely lifts up at this point, which is really nice. So the next part she just did a spin around a really nice clean turn but I could tell she lost her almost lost her balance a little bit on the turn so just making sure once you spin around making sure you spot to help you just get around in a very clean way but then also just getting your feet back on the floor nice and flat so you're able to just land properly. Here she does a layout which is actually really nice. It was very controlled. I could tell she's balancing. Everything looks even. Her leg is up at a nice level off the floor. This foot is flat. This knee is slightly bent a little bit. Her eyes are looking straight up to the ceiling. So really nice. Her arms are just out really nice. Just a real nice simple layout and I could tell she definitely is using her core to keep her balanced as well. So here's now she punched up twice to the ceiling. Those arms are in a nice fist. And then that toe really lovely, nice and pointed. As she brings it up to passe, not quite a passe because it's not at the knee, but the foot is nice because it is pointed. And then again, her energy is just really starting to rise up at this moment and really nice. So this next part, she does a release, dropping her head. And as you see, her knees are bent. Both feet are flat on the floor. Her head is down. Her back is almost flat. So definitely, it was a really quick drop. So I probably would have just let it go just maybe two seconds longer, just to get the full effect of the drop and release. All right, the footwork just now was really, really nice and clean. That would be really easy to teach because you could just see every single step, and she took her time throughout her steps and her movements and did all the feet, the footwork full out. All right, so in the beginning, the dancer starts stepping out and pointing her finger forward and then reaching over. In this moment, reaching over with her right arm, reaching around and back. This is a really nice moment. It definitely matches the music. I would prefer to see her energy just increase just a little bit as she's starting off the dance. Alright, so this next part is a little bit confusing. She did a kickball change, kickball change, and a little bit of twisting, and then when she started to turn around, the footwork got a little confusing, so I would just clean that up a little bit. I'm not quite sure what she was trying to do, but just try to clean it up because you're also spinning around and changing directions. You want to be clear about your feet and what they're doing. So as she went down, again, a nice smooth transition getting up. She was just facing, her body was facing the ceiling. Her eyes were facing the ceiling. She had one hand on the floor, her left hand, I believe, on the floor. And she was able to easily twist her body around and then go into a lunge. And because she was already so low to the floor, and I'm sure due to flexibility, she was able to easily transition that leg forward into a lunge to then get up for the next step. So here she used a really good use her arms full out the arms are up and open and extended she's lifting up in her body and then she almost comes off the floor I'm not sure if she was meant to go up on her toes or not I would have just committed to just rising fully up on your toes and trying to hold that pose or hold it flat but then still holding your chest up nice and high but really good nice arms for that part All right, this next sequence where she's punching her fist down and then out and then she does a little like kind of star hands open jazz hands across in front of her face. Really good job using the music and hitting the accents of the music on this part. I just want to highlight the spin that she just did. It was a very clean spin. She stepped and just did a nice little bend of her knees and then spun around about a full turn and maybe about a quarter and then landed really nicely to the corner here. Her feet are together. As you see her hair is still whipping around but it was just a really clean turn.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So she's looking like a four right now. I like it. Good extension with her right arm and it looks like okay ball placement on the backboard depending on how much power she used. So she's going over there left hand. She's kind of leaving it alone, not really supporting with her right, which is tough, but her form with that actual left hand is pretty good. And I like where her gaze is up right up at the rim. I'll give her a five. She did great. She settled in and found the right power and was pretty consistent with it and made probably over half of her shots. She just needs to use more lift, be quicker between the right and left side transitions, and also have her offhand supporting the ball too. So if she used too much power, look for her to adjust that in the next couple reps. Same thing on the right side, the strong hand is just being left alone with no support from the weak hand. She's got a good knee bend here though.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She increased her octave each time, so she added another octave every time she played through the scale. She had a nice even, her hand position was good. She is playing with an even pulse and all is going well. In the pianist ends her exercise with an arpeggio going from low to high and has done a really nice job keeping the tempo even and steady. Her hand position is very good and overall technique and posture is very well done. Right here you can see her wrists are in a circular motion so there's no stopping of the pattern. The pattern continues going, there's no pausing, and it just continues moving. The pianist is beginning with scales, it looks like in C major, and she has a nice posture and she's starting slowly. This is a moving technical exercise where the pattern is the same as she moves up and down the keyboard and it is very fluid and She is using again good technique good body position good posture The pianist is playing through a cadence pattern and again she has great posture, great hand position.

So that's because his finger just didn't get to the right spot and didn't go down far enough down the fingerboard. The chord shape that he's using for this chord here is accurate. He has all of his fingers in the correct spot. So his first finger on the first fret, second finger on the second fret, third finger on that fret. So he has to stretch out his hand a little bit, but he's getting to the right notes on the right strings, and the chord sounds accurate. The guitarist is demonstrating that the first finger goes from this third fret here to the second fret while these other fingers are being held down. This demonstrates a good amount of finger independence. So his first finger is able to move while the other fingers stay down and that is a skill that many guitarists work very hard at and he's doing it pretty easily and demonstrating it with a lot of ease of use. The guitarist is playing a seventh chord with a stretch of about four frets. So there's one finger there, one finger there, one finger there, and then one finger there. So this is a hand shape that's pretty common in guitar, but he's playing it with a lot of clarity and the fingers are all in the right spots to get the correct chord and notes to sound. He played an incorrect note going up the scale right here with his first finger on that fret, but then he kept going. In order to play some of these arpeggios, the guitarist is kind of stretching out his hand pretty far. So you can see his first finger here and the fourth finger there are pretty far apart. And he's doing that to accommodate those large leaps when playing arpeggios. And he's doing it and it sounds pretty smooth. For this handshape, his first finger here has to reach back to the first fret, while these three fingers over here are a little bit farther down, so there's a little bit of a reach and a bit of a stretch for this chord, but he was able to find the right note at the right time, and it sounds pretty clear. As he played this low note over here, he kind of wiggled his finger a little bit using a bit of vibrato which helps warm up the sound. He played this scale with a lot of clarity and ease. He kept his fingers really close to the fingerboard of the guitar. They didn't leave the string very far. They stayed really close. So he was able to play those notes in rapid succession with a lot of evenness and clarity. The last few times that he shifted his left hand back and forth a little bit, it was very smooth and fluid looking, and so all the notes really sounded smooth and connected, and he was able to go up and down the fingerboard with ease. He played a few notes in this position right here and then his finger very smoothly went to the next spot and he got his fingers in the right spot for the next chord pretty smoothly and pretty evenly. So that showed a lot of good skill of changing hand positions and then finding that next chord. His left hand moved from one position here to the next and then to the next. And so that worked really well. It was very slick and he got to the spots accurately and with not a lot of attention in his left hand. He's using a finger pick here and going in a down, up, down, up, down, up pattern, and he's doing that with a lot of clarity with that finger pick in his right hand right there.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This is crucial that the climber keeps the foot in place and is able to apply the right pressure when making the stance as he will need to gain height. At this point the climber will be coming off the wall due to only securing one point of contact on the wall. The first move out of the start the climber has placed pressure on the foot down below this so that the climber is able to gain height and Doing this the climber also needed to pull himself close to the wall blocking the move in order to reach up to the pinch hold. As we can see the climber has placed the hand as High as he can to create friction and pull on the hold to maintain pressure as he pinches on the hold with the hands With the fingers on the right side and the thumb press on the other side to generate power on the grid As we can see, the climber is making some hand gestures. This will help the climber to visualize the sequence when on the wall before attempting to climb. Now that the climber has secured the right hand on the pinch, the climber needs to now release the left hand to make the next move to the following hold. As we can see, the right foot has come out of placement and this is because the climber is keeping the leg extended to transfer over the weight to the left foot being placed the highest. The right leg being extended, this is called flagging in as the climber is pointing the toe inwards to support the climber staying on his right side when making the pull. This will keep his hips close to the wall when performing the stance and shift the weight over to the highest foot when gaining height. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start, meaning that each hand is holding to its grips and down below the climber has placed the feet, the right foot being in position first. Then he brings the left foot up to place. Once the climb has secured the first stance, then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So even though it's moving slow, when you're moving slow you have to be even that much more precise because you can't get away with missing those little details, especially in basic choreography. I would encourage the dancers to think about their arm placement. Notice how this arm kind of goes dead a little bit. So making sure that you have attention in both arms is super important to this detail of partner choreography, right? Because it's about the frame or the carriage to hold each other up versus when your hands are disconnected and you're pushing and pulling versus even when your arms are separated, that communicates something. So having power and strength when you're separated is also important. I would encourage the dancers to really think about the swing and sway and the curvature of the movement, right? And how you can continue to flow without ever having awkward pauses. So thinking really through how you move through transitions. Immediately, I would encourage the dancers to not look at the floor, but to look at each other, and to look up and out so they don't bump into each other or anything else. I would encourage dancers to keep making sure that they have a strong connection here with the pushing and pulling, telling their partner where to go, or taking instruction from their partner by giving a little pressure or getting a little pressure. I would encourage these dancers to really study and listen to the music because they are off of the beat.

Not being able to protect the ball. The ball is free right here. It's easy, blockable, all right? So you want to make sure your body is in position to protect the ball, all right? And shield the ball from any type of defense. So whooping the ball again is not ideal. All right, you want to be able to go straight up with that shot, all right, instead of leaving room for error for someone to be able to come in between while you're looping in the ball. Good job coming off his left foot. Finish doing this right hand though.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I encourage this dancer to start by plieing, sending those hips back, and making sure they bend those knees so they look more grounded. I would like the dancers to think about spotting and making sure they spot and whip that head around really quickly. I also encourage this dancer to not look so much on the floor, but to look up and out, and also to rotate their shoulders forward, up, and back, so their chest communicates confidence, and it creates another layer of dynamic quality. We've talked about this a lot with this dancer. I encourage them to really engage their rib cage so they have full range of motion besides just using their shoulders. They're also incorporating their back and their torso to create more elegance and flow and grace in their movement so it doesn't feel as choppy.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She's on the balls of her feet. She's letting her pelvis kind of move forward and back, which is sort of driving this movement, which makes it look really strong. Nice grace through the fingertips, good energy out the fingertips as well. Pretty good tabletop here. You can see pretty, it's a little bit of a steep angle here. She probably could have stepped this foot a little bit further out, but pretty good. And also she's pretty well lined up shoulder over elbow over wrist, which is what I wanted to see to begin with. This arm coming up also looks really strong, nice straight elbow and energy out the fingertips. Too slow of a dynamic here. She's bringing this elbow up while this knee is coming in and she's just not attacking it enough. And also the elbow is making a pathway like this which also makes it look obviously more curved and smooth and less sharp. Pretty good job here with a little bit of a sharper quality so that she's able to hold this position for just a moment. It helps to create a shape that the viewer can actually see before she drops it, so good job with that. I like the shape, it's very strong, nice angle here with the shoulder, straight elbow, graceful wrist here, lots of energy out this arm. This arm also looks very clear and strong and I like that she's also dancing on the balls of her feet. That's helping to keep her movement smaller, smoother, more efficient. Very weak here. Well, she did a good job standing up very quickly from this lunge to an upright position, so I will give her that, but the arms are very weak and so the strength of her rising up with the legs is really lost because the arms are too, again, too smooth, not enough attack, not enough sharpness. Good footwork moment again here for her. She's on the balls of her feet She's keeping her feet pretty close to each other which helps to make the movement more efficient more interesting more smooth more elegant She's also got soft knees here, which is also helping with all of those qualities Really stiff here and that's because she's holding her neck really stiffly and gazing straight forward as her arms are coming up and around. So I'd love to see if she could just let that loosen up a little bit more, maybe change her gaze of direction, but just really let it reverberate and relax more and respond more to what she's doing so that this doesn't look so stiff. This is really weak. She's the feet look pretty good But the arms are doing this really kind of strange up-and-down movement with the elbows and the fingers kind of splayed I don't think she really understands the point of this the intention behind this movement so I'd ask her to clarify that with the choreographer and Think about moving maybe more from the shoulders or the core or even moving up and down with the knees rather than the elbows going Up and down it looks really amateurish She's not coming down onto the floor correctly. This is not very good technique for falls. What she needed to do was get her weight on her right foot and her left arm, but rather than that she kind of kept her weight on both feet until the last second when she just put her hand down, but her weight isn't actually really much in that arm. So when we're doing a fall it's really important to establish the hand as a contact point ASAP and to have the shoulder lined up over the elbow over the wrist. You can see here that her shoulders more forward because she doesn't have much weight on it. And also she's doing a pretty good job now of bringing her leg or her weight towards the side of her leg rather than the top, so she is doing that well. Pretty good job here again finding a shape and holding it. I wish she would have held it for just a millisecond longer, but pretty good job. I like that she's got a strong leg here, a nice straight knee and straight out through the toes here, and arms down also look really strong and clear. She's doing this fist motion, one arm and then now bringing the other forward and she's doing it really slowly but not in a controlled way. It lacks energy, it lacks pizzazz, there's no sharpness to it which doesn't match up with the shapes themselves. It's a very straight arm with a fist and making coming into this X position and so neither is she going for a sharp dynamic nor a controlled legato dynamic. What she's doing is more of this like low energy movement and also she's quite stiff through the whole rest of her body. It's just the arms that are moving so it really lacks dynamics, it lacks interest, it lacks coordination. Here's her layout here. Pretty darn good. She did a great job with the arms coming out and up. Nice straight elbows, energy out the fingertips here. Looking up at the ceiling, really great. Her leg looks really strong, nice line out the toes. And it's nice and high, so a 90 degree angle here. A layout, typically we want it sort of to hinge so that the back is actually in line with the foot. So I'd love to see if she could work on her core strength and think of this less as an arch through the back and more as a flat line from the toes to the head. One thing that could help her with that is a plie through her standing leg. And also again, generating some momentum as she came backwards to prepare for this moment. Really weak transition here. She's just sort of standing. She's got straight knees which means that she's not going to have a lot of spring or momentum to really move. She's just standing here in this non-specific way, sort of looking in a non-specific direction, and then she's just slowly bringing her arms up here but it looks really unintentional and weak because there's not a lot of clarity and strength to the shapes and then a lot of tension through her fingers. So here she started her spinal articulation really well with the lumbar spine, but then moves the whole thoracic and cervical spine as one unit, and so loses the nice articulation and again makes it look very stiff. Here she's doing a good job with a plie, a little bit of a twist through the spine. The arms and hands look really strong here. I also like that she's looking up towards her hands in this moment. It helps to make this look a little less stiff. Her dancing in general kind of stiff and so by choosing to gaze upward here it takes away some of that stiffness that we're seeing in other moments. Here she led this movement with her arm with her shoulder coming up and down which looks a little bit tense and a little bit awkward. So I'd say lead more from a twist of the torso which is a much stronger place to move from. This is really nice. She took a really big risk by stepping really far back on this foot, which is really cool because that makes it look exaggerated and even more impressive. Arms again are really nice. She's making a really good arc here. A little bit high in the shoulders, like raising the shoulders a bit too much, but I won't nitpick that too much. Lots of energy out the fingertips, nice straight elbows, and I like that she's really going for it on the balls of her feet here. It makes it look really impressive because she's going so high in the air so quickly. I think she forgot what she was supposed to do here because she just sort of opened her arms and is now letting them reverberate back upward again not dancing through her transitions very well. Good job here. She's brought this hand to the back of her head and I like that she looked away from that hand and slightly gone into that left side of the pelvis there and the attack is really nice, very sharp. It's a very brief moment but she does it very well. She is actually ahead of the music here. She's really rushed this section. She might be nervous about getting in time for the next part of the music. So she really rushed her arms coming back here and was frankly ahead of the beat. And also let go too soon of that shape. Because again, I think she's trying to get to the next thing. She's rushing basically. So because she got there early, I would say that's even more excuse, a more reason to hold the shape for longer. You had time, hold it, let it read as a shape before you move on, but she doesn't. So she's still rushing in this moment as she's letting go of these arms. She's holding this position which is not, it's just frankly a boring position to look at. It just looks like someone's standing there and that is not what this choreography and this music really sounds like or feels like. It doesn't feel pedestrian but she just stands here and holds this for like a whole bar of music and it's not good. I just recommend she have an actual interesting stillness instead of this sort of casual stillness. So because she didn't put her weight on this arm to start with, in order to begin her tabletop she had to move her hand slightly, which means that instead of just one or two fluid movements, she's having to do three to four movements, which makes it look jerky. Pretty good. She's a little bit early for the music here and it's really important to be right in the pocket, especially at the beginning and end of a choreography. The shape itself looks really nice, nice straight knee with the toes on the floor with these mirrored by these really nice arms, great specific shape, angle with the shoulders, nice straight elbow, energy out the fingertips. Again, lack of sharpness in her dynamics coming to this position, which is unfortunate because the position looks really strong. It's just how she got into it. The quality of the movement is really lacking. I'd love to see her sharply attack this movement or come up really slowly and controlled. Again, she's somewhere in between those two and so it doesn't look great. It doesn't look intentional. I wish that as she came up here she did a good job with the dynamics and sort of rolling up through her spine for the most part. Again quite stiff through the thoracic and cervical spine so kind of moving that as one unit, but regardless it was a good dynamic as she came up. I wish she would have kept her hands on the back of her head instead of letting them go as she came up because that nice dynamic with the torso is lost. We can't really enjoy it because the arms are distracting because they look very weak. Good footwork there, nice job being on the balls of her feet. She's moving quickly, efficiently, smoothly. She just brought her leg out to a straight knee but immediately brought it into this position so again lack of clarity and holding her shapes is making the movement look imprecise because it is a little bit imprecise. Again, lack of strength is not helping her. She really straightened these elbows very quickly and then brought them really quickly back up. So we don't get to see a shape. We don't get to see something held. Again, I think she's relying more on her joints than her muscles, which is one reason it doesn't look very strong. Again, lack of dynamics. She does attempt to do a little bit of a quicker sharper movement there, but it looks very very weak I think she may just need to Generally work on the actual strength of the muscles in her arms because even though she's attacking she's sort of resting more on her joint straightening rather than resting on Rather than relying on her muscles moving to make this happen Unfortunately this arm movement really doesn't work for her. She brought it down to her pubic bone and up with this bent elbow but this is as far as it gets. It really looked like it was meant to fully unfold into another straight arm. This coming up here just looks really awkward. So she's begun the choreography here, pretty good shapes. I don't like the bend at the wrist here, that makes her arm shape look a little bit weak. This arm shape looks really strong, nice straight elbow, energy off the fingertip. Also being on the balls of her feet really, really nice. It just lacks oomph and energy and it's because she didn't really attack this moment and so she didn't attack it but she also isn't doing it in a slow controlled way either. It's just sort of somewhere in between and so it lacks clarity and interest and as the first movement of the whole choreography it's really important to grab attention and she doesn't do that. Pretty good three-step turn here. She's staying on the balls of her feet. She does use her hips occasionally as her pivot point, but for the most part, the balls of her feet are her pivot points, which is exactly how we want to do it. She is somewhat spotting her head. You can see that her gaze is kind of towards her arm here, which means that her gaze is further than the rest of her body as she's turning. And so that shows that she's trying to spot her head. I'd love a bit more specificity with the hands here, though. It just looks a little bit asymmetrical and in unintentional. Oops, let me go back. Great attack here right on the beat, but again I'd love to see her hold that shape before dropping it here. Good footwork again. She was on the balls of her feet until this last moment Which helps her to be more efficient and smooth this foot came out quickly and back behind her again So this is a good section for her. It looks really strong She finishes her layout by bringing the working leg back towards the standing leg, and that's not typical for a layout. It's much more interesting and beautiful and effective if you can actually aim to step further out away from your working leg. And part of the reason that she ends up bringing this foot back is because this knee was straight, and so she doesn't really have anywhere to go except backwards towards that knee, and so it loses the bigness, an exaggerated shape that it could have. This is nice. She brought this up in a really sharp dynamic and the hands look really strong. She did a little flick of the wrist as she brought the hands up, which looks great. I love that she's got a nice straight knee here, actually, because it helps to just emphasize the tightness of the shape. That was really nice. She did a sharp blade with this arm and is now bringing it around her body to help her with this turn, really good attack. Good job with this arm movement here. She's done a very sharp dynamic and brought the arms straight up into really nice shape Good fist there looks really strong and clear holds it for long enough for it to read this Leg looks really strong because she's leading with the knee but she's getting and she's getting the knee really high without having to arc the Pelvis forward or bend this knee very far, which means that she has good Flexibility through her hamstrings so she can bring the knee up but keep her posture pretty strong Also, she's pushed into the floor with this foot which I can tell because she's currently in a plantar flex position that's helping to add a nice sharp dynamic but also helping to bring the knee up further and Having the foot plantar flexed here also makes for a really nice line So she's just walking backwards here. I would love to see her make this more exaggerated not only because it would be more interesting to look at but would be a better preparation for what she's going to do next because it would build up momentum. So I'd love to see more of a leap rather than a walk backwards. Pretty good attack with these arms and a really nice pathway bringing them down out and up in a nice arc really strong through the arms here great angle of the shoulders nice straight elbow energy out the fingertips and a graceful bevel of the wrist. Good shimmy, really, really good shimmy. Nice and strong. She understands the mechanics of how to do it back and forth. She did it in a really sharp way. The arms look really strong and clear and are helping to exaggerate rather than detract from the shimmy. Great arm arc from the front to the back here. I'd like to see, well, that's actually really nice. She's doing a nice curve here with some energy at the fingertips. This is also a strong shape. Again, lacking attack, lacking energy, lacking personality, lacking pizzazz. I'd love to see partly why that's happening is because she's just kept her head in the same position as the previous moment. So if she could add something here, maybe looking over her shoulder or following her arm with her head, something to just give it a little bit more pizzazz. So here she's sort of I think was supposed to do a body roll but again really stiff through her spine and so she doesn't quite achieve that and it looks very stiff.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He goes up on the balls of his feet. It looks like he's like almost shooting a free throw, which is fine. You don't really need to jump on your free throw. I would like to see some elevation, however, in this drill. Better here. Here's the rim. Here's a shooting arm. Great extension. Let's get that guide hand up. Again, let's bend those knees on our landing. Again, as he shoots, let's hold that follow-through. I mean, a lot of times hold it till it hits the ground. Again, he comes down, he's just straight up, you know, not bending his knees in a balanced, slow position. Again, I'd also like to see his feet more staggered, one foot in front of the other for better balance and control. Much better view here. I would like to get that guide hand elbow down more. It's kind of sticking out. Much better extension here of the shooting arm. Let's flick that wrist down, point those fingers down. And you could tell, you know, the ball's kind of like, just, it's not even spinning. I mean, it's kind of just like a knuckle ball and it's because of this guide hand is too much in the shot. Here he is shooting with his left hand. Love that the guide hand is here on the side. Much better extension here of the elbow. Again, would love to see some lift and elevation. Bend those knees, drop that hip and the butt down, and be a ready shooter, catch and shoot. Again, he's waiting on this pass, would love for him to kind of back up and step in to meet this pass and catch and shoot. Here he's, you know, here he's kind of taking his time, pausing. I mean, he's probably learning how to shoot here, which is fine, but in a game-like situation, you've got to catch and shoot quickly before the defense gets there. And I just really believe in practicing drills that are game-like. Love the lift here. Much better job of flexing and bending those knees. Would like to have more timing though of getting up off the ground as you lift it. Like he could be off the ground already as the ball is lifted up. But love how he's got his shooting hand behind the ball, that guide hand. Maybe a little bit on, it's hard to see in this picture, but maybe a little bit too far on the other side of the ball. The great lifting of the ball to get it up toward your forehead so it's not easily blocked. Yep, left arm, that's a shooting hand. Again, let's bend our knees as we come down on our landing. Here's a great look of his shot. Again, you can see where he's, as the ball's being released, this is actually a really good picture. He's shooting with both hands. It's just going to throw off the rotation of the ball. And, you know, in basketball, you love to have this backspin as the ball makes its way to the basket. Here, it's probably going to go side to side, hit that rim and go out. So let's establish a shooting hand. Here it is his left hand, but I think his guide hand is way too much in his shot. Here, you know, he just needs to do a better job of cocking that wrist back and then releasing it. His release is really good. I like the extension here and I like the guide hand there. Let's get that elbow, that guide hand elbow down parallel to the floor. Here the shooter at the foul line is a left-handed shooter. We'd love to see him, you know, back up and step into this pass. He's got very little lift or elevation here. But you can see the extension of that left arm. That looks really good, a snapping of the wrist, if you will, in this particular frame. The guide hand is here on the side. Looks pretty good in this shot. You can't really see the wrist coming down. We'll see that later on. Again, here's the basket. And in this particular view, everything's to the right. I mean, his shooting hand, that rim should be right here between, that should be the view. Everything here is to the right. He's kind of shooting across his body. His vision is over here, and it needs to be between. He should be looking between his left shooting arm and his guide hand. Again, get that guide hand elbow down and under, get it on the side, not too bad there. Let's flick that wrist down, snap those fingers down, great extension of the elbow. Again, let's elevate and lift. On the follow-through, pretty good here. Love that guide hand here to stay more in the picture here in the shot. You see here he drops it down. Let's keep that guide hand up. Again, we'd love to see him land, bending those knees. He's a little straight up on his landing. Let's cushion that landing, land on the balls of our feet. Great extension of the elbow. There you got it. There's the breaking of the wrist. Great look at the guide hand as it's not so much in the shot here. Good extension here of the legs. We'll again love to see him leave the floor here. Here as he shoots it, and this is what I'm talking about, I think he's a left hand shooter, but it seems like now he's shooting with his right hand. Definitely both hands are in the shot. It's just going to throw off the touch and the accuracy of the ball as it makes its way to the basket. This is what we call when you don't have a shooter's touch. Again, both elbows are pointed out, and you can see that in this picture here. I do love the elevation here, or the extension, I should say, of his hips. Here you do see a little bit of a snapping of the wrist, but you can see how that elbow kind of turns out to the left. We want to keep it parallel to the floor. In this particular frame, you know, he is kind of leaning, which is probably going to throw off the shot. Stay balanced and in control.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Also, creating more ball control and security going into the finish while creating a closer gap of releasing the ball quicker towards our target area while creating separation from opposing defenders in a game-like scenario, trying to take, steal, or strip the ball from the offensive player. Looking at the player go into his left-handed, Mikey and Leah pretend on the right frame. A slight improvement the player can make is to jump with full maximum effort, getting more lift off the ground, allowing the ball to gain more momentum, arc and accuracy to get above the rim, and also preventing opposing defenders in a game-like scenario, having easy access of trying to contest or block the offensive player's shot. Looking at the release of the player's right-handed mic and layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice again the player does a good job of having his shoulder square towards the back of the rim, allowing the ball to be directed in a better angle, traveling more accurately towards the target area as we look on the left side of the frame. The player does a good job of getting his follow through and wrist pointing towards the direction of the target after the release, allowing the ball to create the proper spin and rotation it needs to get towards the target area, creating the proper angle of dropping inside the rim, resulting in a completed layup attempt. Looking at the player on the right frame going into his right-handed Mike and layup attempt, we can notice that the player did a decent job of getting a slight lift off the ground, allowing the ball to gain enough power, momentum, and arc it needs to get above the rim, hitting our target area, and dropping through the proper channel. Looking at the player go into his right-handed micing layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice that the player did a good job scoring his shoulders going towards the back of the rim, allowing the ball a better angle of being directed accurately towards the target area. Looking on the right frame as our player is going into his left-handed mic and layup attempt, we can notice that the player did a decent job of stepping with his right leg. However, we want the player to jump off his right leg or off of two feet as the player is doing, allowing his shoulders to be squared towards the back of the rim. Going into his release. Also allowing his body's momentum to carry him towards the left side of the frame, allowing the ball to gain the proper momentum, power, arc, and accuracy to get above the rim, hitting our target point. Looking at the release of the players left-handed mic and layup attempt, we can notice on the left frame, the player does a great job of getting his fall through, going in wrist, going towards the direction of the rim, allowing the ball as we see to create the proper spin and rotation it needs to get above the rim, to hit around our target area, which is going to be the top left corner of the box on the backboard, allowing the ball to create the proper angle it needs of dropping inside the rim. We also want the player to bring his ball placement position above his shoulder area to create separation from opposing defenders in a game-like scenario, being able to strip, take, or steal the ball from the offensive player. Looking at the player go into his right-handed, Mike can lay up attempt on the right frame. We can notice that the player does well at locating his eyes on his target before going into his jumping motion, allowing a much easier finish. The player also does a good job of jumping and stepping with his left leg, allowing his body's momentum to carry him towards the right side of the rim. Looking at the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player did a great job of getting his follow through and wrist pointing towards the direction of the target, which allowed the ball to create the proper spin, rotation it needed, and arc to get above the rim, hitting our target point, the top left corner of the box on the backboard, allowing the ball to create the proper angle it needs of dropping inside the rim.

Looking at the player go into his left-handed Mike in layup attempt We can notice that the player does a good job again Locking his eyes on his target before going into his release allowing a much Accurate finish However, we want the player to improve on Keeping his ball placement position above his shoulder area To create more ball control and security on the finish Also creating a quicker release Allowing the ball to become Closer towards the rim Looking at the player on the left side of the frame on his release from his right-handed mic and layup attempt, we can notice that the player did a decent job getting his follow-through going towards the direction of the target allowing the ball to travel accurately towards the proper target area which is going to be the top right corner of the box on the backboard allowing the ball to create the proper angle it needs of dropping inside the rim.

Now, it's important where the exact placement of the hand should be as the climber is making a dynamic move. Once the climber gets to make this placement, the climber is doing this with an open hand, so friction must be applied, which the climber will have to send his center of gravity and weight onto the higher hand by pressing down on it and creating friction. So now the climber was able to make that reach for the many components that requires up for the reach. And we can see how the left leg is still extended. This to help the climber have balance. Here we can see the climber performing a foot swap, where the climber glances over quickly to make sure that he has enough space for the foot. Knowing that the foothold is big, the climber is able to comfortably jump out of the left foot out of placement and decides to bring the right toe into placement. If the climber was to attempt this again, the climber will have to really apply sufficient pressure on the throw. And it's important that the climber does this quickly, as the climber will automatically have their feet peel off the wall. And it's important that the climber also gets to hang on to the grip with the left hand, being the pinch that he was holding on before. Here we can see the climber starting at a one hand hold start. So this is when both hands get to be placed on the same hold. This is called matching. The type of the hold that the climber is holding onto is onto a pinch hold, meaning that the climber will be using the hands and pinching onto that hold, which he does this with both hands. Now, having the thumb underneath will help the climber generate a lot of power grip while keeping in place, thinking as a clamp, and to generate power from the top fingers that are already placed on an edge, the climber must create pressure by leaning back on those holds. As we can see, the climber has the left foot placed onto the wall, and the type of hold that it is down at the bottom is a big foot hold, so it sticks out and the front of the toe box is pressing against that hold. Now the climber will be able to start to climb on hill until he gets his right foot off the ground. Here we can see the climber wasn't able to apply sufficient pressure on the right hand. This is necessary as due to the dynamic move, the other parts of points of contact would potentially be compromised as they would be relying on the body weight transfer to be on the top hold. The climber also needed to sustain the grip on the left hand as naturally as the climber will have their feet come off the wall. And so potentially if the climber was to sustain that right hand hold, then the climber would have to pull himself in. Here we can see the climber getting prepared to make a dynamic move. Now the climber would most likely be sending the direction of the throw from the foot. This one, the right foot being placed, helps the climber not only to keep his right side against the wall but also for him to gain leverage in the direction that he needs to go. But in order for him to gain more leverage when making the stance going up will be from the pull of the hand. So the arm will have to come tightly onto a pull up that will bring his chest towards the wall first as he stands up for the direction. Now the left leg being open meaning not in any foot placements, the climber is bending the leg. When he gets to do the stance he will extend that left leg. The left leg will act as a position where the climber will get to help with the propelling by extending it to gain more force when at the throw. Here we can see the climber reaching up to the pinch holdout left. This is closed grip so the climber is trying to aim on staying at the bottom part of that hold. Having a closer pinch helps the climber generate more power and sustain the hold for a longer period of time. Also to create pressure the climbers is still leaning on the hold. As we can see he's right leg is extended and this is called flagging in. So the climber in this instance has brought the right toe to push against the wall and this is helping the climber to keep their hips close to the wall as he would need to be leaning onto the right side. And to keep the hips square as well meaning to bring the hips close to the wall. As we can see he's brought his left leg to be open stance by keeping the knee being out pointing out to the left opening up the hip.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And in this position we can see that they're hanging on with their right hand here and they're utilizing a left foot on this yellow hold here and I think their right foot is also on the wall as well right here. So in this position they are kind of setting themselves up to do a good transition over to that left side over there. The one thing that the climber needs to really make sure they focus on is continuing to transition over that left foot just because it is guiding them in the direction that they need to go to so the more that they can transition their body weight over that left foot the better it's going to be and give them a better chance of hanging on to the hold overall. And so here we can see the climber is getting closer to that yellow hole that they're aiming for But as they're doing that we can see that their left foot has now slipped off of the foothold It almost kind of seems as if the climber was trying to make this a powerful Dynamic move or they kind of had to jump off that foot in order to reach it But by doing so they did place the rest of the body kind of hanging out away from the wall now Because their foot is no longer on that foothold So what I would encourage for the climbers to continue to transition Their left knee over that left foot and making sure that left foot stays in that foothold Which will give them the best chance of gathering on to that yellow hole they're aiming for and continue further movement after that", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So he has the left foot on and to kind of bounce, he doesn't do a backflip, but he does kind of drop that foot off so he can be left hand on right foot on. It kind of does open his body up and away, and this is kind of be a little bit more core tense. So I think the move here, I'm going to leave the left foot here and twist this right knee down and in. So that way you kind of bring your hip into the wall and kind of twist over it. And then again he starts kind of doing this weird dropping the left arm super far down low. I don't know if it's to rest. He's not really hanging it long enough to probably get anything back. So maybe he's just going for style points. But whatever it is, he's got to kind of relax on this side and he's got to kind of pull it back through and regain. So it kind of seems like a wasted movement when his arm could just stay on or stay closer. So you don't have to move it as much or swing it around as much. And notice as he moves that right arm, his body position doesn't even shift at all. And as he kind of goes to take more weight to that right arm, he's able to shift that right foot back out and get opposite pose by being right hand, left foot on. Then puts the heel up and right to try to make this last move of finishing out. This kind of looks like a sloper. Doesn't look like the most positive. So hopefully that heel hook, what it's going to do is going to take the place of his right arm. So as he gets his left arm here, that heel hook will free up the right arm. So I think what it is, it's placed maybe a little bit prematurely. And so what he wants to do is hit the hand first, then set the right heel hook so he can move the right hand. And again, kind of feet cutting here, causing him to kind of pull up. So now it seems like maybe he is getting a little bit tired, isn't able to maintain that good positioning. So he's kind of taking more of the weight to his arms. Then he kind of shakes out the right arm again and relaxes the right foot, which kind of makes him barn door a little bit because now he's left hand, left foot. So you can see his whole body kind of just rips out. So that's where you want to stay. You know, if we are going to rest and do all this stuff, we want to make sure we're in a good position, really have the legs tensioned up and loaded up so they can take as much weight while we're on one arm. So we're off to a good start this this kind of starting position is really scrunchy He'll notice he kind of really loads up this left foot. So when he starts off to the right You know, he's toned down a little bit more like this and his knees over here to the right But as he pulls into he pulls that knee up and over So he can really shift his weight over that hole and kind of perch on to it So really thinking with the with the lower feet You know with the legs and the waist and what his torso was doing before what his arm is doing And again kind of resting out shaking that right arm out trying to get something back. Yeah it doesn't seem like it's been long enough to have to shake out. Or he's kind of doing this arm drop thing like he did in the move before. And for this move, this undercling, this is one of those moves where you really can't pull harder into it and pull yourself up. You've got to really drive those feet. Left leg does pick off, so maybe having a higher foot or kind of twisting this right knee more into it so you can kind of post more on that left foot would save this little foot cut. But overall, it doesn't seem to hold them back too much. And we can kind of see him position out too. So as he makes that first move, rocking over that knee, he kind of sinks into this left arm. So now he's left arm, left foot. So instead of foot swapping, he kind of just brings this right foot slightly behind it, kind of pokes it up into a nice little back leg so that way he can balance out and move that right arm freely.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As the dancer begins with some basic salsa step, right away she demonstrates that she has an understanding of the movement vocabulary, she's able to incorporate her arms choreographically in a way that's clear and appropriate, and has a lot of clarity in her footwork which is helping her to embody the rhythm. As the dancer moves through some quicker footwork here, she struggles to stay connected to the rhythm and find precision in her movement. She needs to find some additional clarity and refinement in her footwork, as well as the choreographic inclusion of her arms. As the dancer performs a turn around herself, she's able to do so fairly quickly and efficiently because she's spotting her head and has her arms shaped very strongly above her head, which is helping her to find stability and perform the turn quickly and efficiently. She also has found a lot of clarity in her footwork here as well, which is helping to move her through the turn and keep her connected to the rhythm.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Good extension here. I'd just like to see that elbow come in a little bit. She needs to snap that wrist down. And then that guide hand, again, it looks like she kind of, it's, it's got some sort of movement here. Could be kind of throwing off that, off the shot as well. Here she's dribbling. Again, you're going to be defended and guarded. And you know, she's dribbling with the left hand and she's a right-hand shooter. Again, it's a jump shooting drill. We don't need this dribble here. And then look how she looks down. You know, you lose sight of your target. Beautiful verticality. I love to see that follow through that with that elbow in, more in line with the rim and the basketball, kind of coming across her body. And just the consistency is just snapping down that wrist so that we continue to get that backspin on the basketball as it makes its way to the basket. And then she kind of seals, she locks it out. Again, off balance, follow through. Here's the basketball. See, now she's really off balance. Look at her trying to... she's leaning forward on these toes. I think the ball hit the rim and popped out, but she's still up on her toes. She should be down, you know, soft landing, bent knees, butt down. Again, we just need better flow and consistency here. Here's the shot, you know as she jumps, you know, we just got to have really like good timing and flow here I love that she's jumping and getting up Extending the hips. We just need a little softer, you know Touches that ball leaves the hand get that elbow in let's snap that wrist down It could have been how the ball sitting on this hand initially, you know We just wanted to come off those fingertips with a nice rotation and backspin Not sure where the guide hand is here. We'd love to see that in the in this view as well Here she dribbles. Again, we don't really need a dribble. We need to catch and shoot the ball quickly. Unless it's a free throw, you know, we gotta, you don't have time to take a dribble here in front of you. You're gonna be guarded and defended and not be able to shoot at all. So be ready shooter. Step into this pass. You know, really get ready by dropping the hips, bending the knees, stepping those feet. One, two, catch and shoot. Gotta be a little bit quicker. Again, look at the landing. See all the weight on that right foot and knee. Left leg kind of pops back. She pulls that follow-through back. Let's hold it out there until it, you know, she might have a little too much arc on it. You know, we don't, we don't need quite that much. Again, it's got to travel so far here. Let's take a little bit off of that. Hold that follow-through though. Stretch that arm and keep it out there. See how she starts her shot from here? She kind of pushes it. I think that's probably why she's off target some here. You know, we want to, you know, you don't want to really dip it down and obviously you don't want to push it from your, from your belly button. You want to raise it and then shoot it. She's shooting it from here. So again, it's got just a long ways to go here. Probably off target. I like her knees bent. Let's spray those feet a little bit as well. Again, here's her landing, a little off balance, you know, on the balls of her feet. The knees are really, a lot of the weight's out here on these knees. Again, let's hold that follow-through out instead of bringing that right arm back. She's kind of jerking it back, which could cause the ball to go off target here. And then, you know, the landing, again, a lot of her weight is on this right foot. We want to land evenly here. Just be balanced, cushion landing. Hold that follow-through again. Let it follow the ball to the basket. Not, we don't want it to go straight up. Again, much better landing on two feet. Maybe drop the knees a second, a little bit here, but again hold that phalla out. Let's not jerk the arm up and back. Stay with it. Again, a little better here starting the shot up a little higher instead of here. So that's much better point of release. That guide hand comes off. Here she's raising the ball a little higher. Let's spread our feet so we can lift and push and have a good base that supports us. Yeah, it hits far right, I think right here. Again, off balance landing. We just gotta really work on having more of a balanced landing, cushion, spread our weight evenly across both feet. Here's the follow-through. The arm is extended. However, it's kind of the elbows popping out. You know, we want to line everything up here, the ball to the rim. Snap that wrist down. Good extensions. You does this really well. We just got to work on the jumping and and make it a little bit more smoother, softer. And again, she could start in close, add the little simple jump here. Nice and easy touch. Again, kind of starts her shot I noticed like from here. That may have a little do with how she's shooting it so hard. But this looks nice. But it's kind of, you could tell here, she's kind of shooting the ball really low. So it's kind of pushing it instead of lifting it up here and then shooting it. She's starting her shot really down low here. And that might be why it's hitting the rim so hard as well. Here's that guide hand. It looks bent, which is what we want. But let's get this guide hand facing in. You know, it was on the ball initially. Let's just not have any movement with it. Keep that palm facing the basketball. Here comes the shot again. See how she shoots it really low Instead of lifting it up here and shooting it. It's a little flat. I Mean, I love how the fingers come off, you know, that's that's good. And let's get this guide hand I'm not sure if it's in the shot or not We need it just to stay stationary, but she does jump. She does extend her hips Again, let's get that elbow in of the shooting arm. She does extend it, but we want it in line here with the basketball. Kind of pops out, comes across her body. Good push-off verticality. Hips are extended. Here the shooter shooting a mid-range jumper. I love that she's jumping and she's got her feet apart. Maybe square this left foot and knee more facing the basket. It looks like it's a little turned to the outside as I pause it here. Good extension of the hips. I'm looking at her follow-through. I mean, not bad. I'd get the elbow in a little bit more in line with the basketball, but she does extend that right shooting arm. You see the elbow extended out. It's a little fuzzy, but let's snap that wrist down, make it a little more fluid. I'm not sure what the guide hand is doing here. It looks like it's pulled back or curled back. Let's just keep it out there. Bent elbow, palm facing in. Again, here comes the pass, look where she caught it. So again, I just am a firm believer, like to be a great jump shooter, you gotta go meet this pass. And it's about being ready in between shots, stepping into it, bending the knees, dropping the hips, having the hands ready. You don't wanna step back. When you step back, that defender's got you. They're gonna get in your space and take away everything, shot, pass, et cetera. Here's her landing again, just the follow-through is way across her body. We want it to be more, you know, let's follow that, let's follow that basketball to the rim. Bend our knees, distribute our weight evenly across both feet, maybe hold that guide arm up for balance. Again, much better release here. Looks like she's snapping it down here. We gotta get this guide hand out of the shot and just let it stay stationary, but good ups here, good extension. Again, here's the ball. Again, that follow-through is really high. We want it to be more in line with the basketball. Better job of, you know, being soft here, a little knee bend here, which is nice to see on the landing. But her landing, all that weight landing on the right foot, she picks the left leg up. Again, let's have a smooth, consistent follow-through here. Here she jerks it back. Again it's probably going to throw off the ball in its rotation, in its flight path. I like her foot right foot out in front of the other and she does bend her knees but again it's all from this this positioning she's not really stepping into it so now she's having to use her legs but just going straight up there's no momentum like just like if you meet that pass you're stepping into it here is just really relying on just being able to lift her body up I like how she's looking over the top of the ball at her target Again, mid-range jumper. She is jumping. Nice job. Good extension of the hips. Again, we need that follow-through. There it's a little bit better here. There's the basketball. Eyes are up. A little flat. We'd like it to be a little more up. Just get that guide hand out of the shot. I don't have any idea what it's doing here. I just know how I want it to look. You know, and then here's her follow-through, there's the basketball. Maybe a little softer landing, bent knees, drop the hips, hold this follow-through. You want the arm to kind of, almost like it's following the basketball, so not straight up. And you know, we'd love to see it here in this ego view, it's kind of popping out if you will.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So then it looks like you're taking bigger steps on the step step step and then rock your hips and then step step step somewhere else, rock your hips. And I think that could have helped to make a little more sense with this dancer. Also I noticed her arms have not really moved, so by this point she definitely should have had a bit more upper body movement. The arms go up, sideways, down, just making sure there's something happening throughout the entire body. And here she's doing a kick with her right foot, just kicked up in the air, and then doing a little step with her left and back. Again, I think this movement just needs to be more defined. So if you're going to kick, fully kick, if you're going to step, take the full steps so it's very clear what it is you're doing. Right now, it again just looks a little jumbled up, and it's hard to tell what she's trying to do. So here she's doing just kind of a stepping side to side, taking three steps and then doing a little hip rock. Here she's definitely off the count of the music, so it doesn't really line up or sync up with what she's doing. So I would definitely suggest trying to get back on the music so you're on beat. But then also really accentuate and add more detail to the hips and the steps to the side, because it feels a little jumbled, and I'm just not quite sure what she's trying to do. I think this dancer has a lot they could work on, but I think the main thing is counting would definitely help. So that way they're keeping track of their steps and making sure they're staying on the music. And then of course using the full body, adding the arms and also using more of the space. So here she's kind of doing like a Charleston variation. She's adding a little extra step in on her left foot, but she is kicking that leg out. I would suggest maybe pointing this toe just for a nice presentation. But again, I think counting and being on the music would help her a lot, just an overall presentation, because it's not really blending well with the music or making sense to the viewer. So here again she is doing her step side to side and then doing a little hip rock. So I was trying to count it out and there really isn't a clear pattern. Definitely for a beginner basic learner you want to make sure the patterns are very clear because they're not at the level where you can do just different timing just to you know make them understand the steps easier. So definitely thinking about like making it the timing a lot clearer so that way you're on the music and it just makes sense to whoever's trying to learn the steps. So the dance just starts with a kind of a step and glide, step glide, step glide. So you're stepping one foot forward and then sliding it in, then steps the other foot forward and slides it in, and as she slides it stays on the floor. Here's one of the very few times where she was actually on the correct beat, so just making sure you are dancing on the with the right timing, but then also I would suggest maybe doing something with the arms just because it opens up the show and it just looks a little dull just her feet doing that motion. So here she's like taking steps forward and kicking and it's not really consistent so again I can't really tell what step she's trying to do. So again just finding more clarity, finding the counts. I think counting out loud may have helped this dancer a lot just so she's staying on the beat and then giving each step is proper do that it needs for each count. So here she's just doing a step and toe touch back. So right now she just did a step on her left and her right foot is touching with the ball of her foot going back behind her. This is a really good simple basic step that she's doing and she's executing it correctly. But again just making sure she's on the correct timing for any student. So the hip swings I think could have been a bigger moment, especially because you hear the horns nice and full. So don't be afraid to move those hips if that's what you're going to do. Shake them and then also add some upper body arm movements as well.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Undercling is when is the palm facing up towards the hold as the jug is upside down and the climber keeps the thumb on the outside to create pressure on a pinch at the lip of the hold. For body movement the climber had dropped the left foot. This one with the left leg extended is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. The leg being extended this is for the climber to then keep balance over his her areas of support as she sends the arm over to the left side. The climber has only positioned the left toe into place while the right foot is out and extended in space. With the right leg extended, this is called flagging out, so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot. The climber is now leaning back, bringing her hips close to the wall to bring her center of gravity into the wall and not drop her weight. In doing so, the climber quickly makes a performance to the next hold, where she sends the left hand underneath the hold. However, the climber yet has not appraised the grip and potentially she will be sustaining onto the lip of the hold or repositioning herself. The climber had stepped off from the climb due to being restricted on the move. Ideally, if the climber wanted to bring the right hand grip to the undercling, the left toe being in position would have been a better option as she would be able to keep her left side of the body towards the wall and able to lean back comfortably while sustaining the right hand grip on the undercling. The climber in this position was restricted due to the inability of releasing the left hand with the right foot being in place. This was difficult for the climber to sustain because the undercling is being sustained from above her which makes it really difficult for the climber to secure the hand placement. The climber is approaching the wall to assess the moves on the climb from the ground. This will give an idea for the climber to visualize the moves that she will need to encounter when on the wall. The climber is able to secure the grip and this time applying even the palm towards the lip of the hold to create more friction of the skin towards the grip. As we can see the way that the climber is sustaining it, she has to be pulling it away from the wall. This is hard for the climber to do, a reason why the climber is leaning over on the opposite direction of the entry of the hold. The climber is glancing down at the feet to perform a foot switch. The way that she's performing the foot switch, she's bringing the right toe to come into place at the hold. Once the climber creates pressure of the left toe coming into place, the climber then releases the left foot. The climber is starting in a one-hold start where she places both of the hands onto the same hold.

Placements of the arms are great. These arms are extended at this point. But when the dancer was moving the arms in front, it was almost like they had a drum beneath their arms that they were playing. So the dancer, I believe, should be pressing out while the body's going the opposite direction, and vice versa. The dancer is reaching out here. It's okay, obviously, if that's the choreography, but even if it's not, it does look uniform and it looks like that's what the dancer's supposed to do. That was their interpretation of the movement. So for this, it looks okay. You want to make sure that that is a reach and not so much a hop in that movement, where the arm reaches out to the right and the leg reaches out to the left. Here in placing the hands, probably would like to see them extended a little bit more. If the choreography is stylized for the dancer to just place the hand out, that works too.

So are they, when are they supposed to be on the ball of their foot versus when are they supposed to be whole foot versus when should they be like tapping the toe of the foot. I would encourage the dancer to be more grounded, so to plie more and to send their hips back a little bit further so it doesn't look like a march as opposed to like a grooving in this basic choreography. I think the dancer could take bigger steps and a way to do that is by being more grounded.

Here he is using a strainer to strain out the loose tea leaves in the tea mixture. The strainer is being placed over the cup that the tea is being poured into. And this is the proper procedure. Now, if you were using a tea bag, there would be no need for a strainer as the tea bag contains all the tea leaves. Here a small saucepan has been selected to use to make the milk tea. This is the appropriate size and type of pan to use. One could also use a kettle, either an electric kettle or a kettle that you place on the burner to boil the water or milk. The individual preparing the tea has good control of the temperature, the flame, under the saucepan. He never allows the tea mixture to boil up and almost over the edge of the saucepan. It is always kept on a low boil and this is what you want to see. The tea leaves have now been added to the saucepan where the water is just starting to come to a boil. A better technique would be to boil the water and then pour the liquid over the tea leaves, either in a mug or a teapot, and allow the tea to steep for about three to five minutes. That way you're extracting out the most flavor. In this case, the milk tea is made primarily with water. Now this is totally acceptable. Tea is based on personal preference as far as taste.

But so it was a little unclear to me what was happening, but maybe because the dancer kept moving, they were able to kind of play it off a little bit or appear to be of where what the movement should have been. The dancer has great placement of the arms and extension, as well as nice isolations in the hips, tapping the toes there while the weight is on the back foot. And this movement and the shoulders are isolated, isolating and keeping up with the beat and the rhythm. And the dancer has a very nice pace with the movement and the music. Actually, it looks like the dancer might have been marking it before everything started or improvising it or they had done it and made a mistake and then they started again.

Here the violinists both performs a slight gesture, a little nod to help them time their entrance and begin together. They played at a soft dynamic level. Here the violinist demonstrated the bow stroke that they would use at the end of the piece just in the air above their violin and it definitely helps to plan out which direction whether they're going up or down with the bow with their partner in a duet so that they are both matching. It would help to practice these parts alone for a while. So the first violinist should practice their part individually, using a tuner if needed, and while watching the left-hand finger positions on the fingerboard. The second violinist should practice their part alone for a while as well, too, to work on intonation. And then they should practice together again, really listening to one another, watching their finger position for more accuracy and intonation of the pitches.

An accidental is when there's a note that's played that is not included in the key signature of the piece and instead either a flat, sharp, or natural sign is written in front of the note to indicate which pitch that it should be played as. Right before they stopped playing this phrase, the intonation between the two violinists was a bit off. The violinists had more success when attempting their cue the second time and starting their piece the second time.

And this is, you know, very basic seasoning that's being used, which is fine. You can also add other dried herbs or fresh herbs or even some allium, such as shallots or red onion or scallions. The preparer is using a diagonal cut, a 45 degree diagonal cut on the cucumber. This is a more decorative cut. However, you can do a straight cut across creating half moons or half circles, or you could make an additional lengthwise cut on each half and just cut it into small cubes. The cucumber is being peeled here. When making a cucumber salad, it is not necessary to always peel the cucumber. So for just a run-of-the-mill traditional cucumber, it's going to have a slightly thicker skin than say a hothouse English cucumber or Persian cucumber. However, you can still leave the skin on or you can stripe the skin by alternating peeling. So you have green and light green, dark green, light green. With the Persian cucumber, the hothouse cucumber, it's really not necessary to peel. The preparer is using a commercial salad dressing, commercially prepared salad dressing, and this is absolutely fine. The benefit to that is that the flavors are well balanced in a commercial product, but it's still important once the salad is mixed to ensure that it is tasted to make sure that all the seasonings are well balanced because there was additional salt and pepper added. The cut of that first tomato is indicative of a dull knife. The preparer had to actually separate the two pieces of tomato that were initially cut in half. So a sharp knife will allow you to go through the skin of the tomato all the way through to the cutting board so that separation manually is not needed. Just noting that the vegetables are being used directly from the packaging. So the cucumber was taken out of the bag from the grocery store. The tomatoes are being taken out of the plastic container that they came in. It is important to make sure that vegetables, or really any vegetables, should be washed prior to cutting. This would prevent cross-contamination from any contaminants that end up on your cutting board. It's also important for ready-to-eat foods, such as salads, where they're not going to be cooked, and any potential for contaminants be removed prior to cutting. Here the preparer is taking a Japanese cleaver, a Chinese cleaver, and drawing the blade across the cutting board to clean the cutting board off. This practice of drawing that blade across the cutting board will dull the blade. And when cutting, you want the sharpest knife possible to prevent any injury. And even though that sounds counterintuitive, a dull knife is more likely to slip and cause a cut, whereas a sharp knife generally will not slip while cutting. Here the same process that was used for the first half of the cucumber is being used for the second half, where it is being cut in half lengthwise, the flat sides being put down on the cutting board, and a 45 degree angle cut is being made as the cucumber is being sliced. Prior to cutting the cucumber in pieces, the preparer cuts the cucumber lengthwise. And what this gives you is two flat surfaces that you can place on the cutting board, two flat surfaces of the cucumber. And the other thing that this does is prevents a round vegetable or fruit from rolling while cutting, and the potential for rolling can end up yielding a cut. The knife can easily slip if the vegetable rolls. So in this case, he's taking the two flat sides, putting them down on the cutting board, and making his cuts. The preparer has a small bag available near the work area to put any food scraps in. This is a great idea as you don't want your work area to be cluttered with a lot of food scraps and other waste from the cooking process. It does not have to be a bag. It can be a bowl or any other type of small container. This way you collect everything and at the end of the cooking process you can dump out.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Bypassing a hard match on this pink hold, the climber just locks it off and perches over that right foot and is able to roll out and get into this jug here with relative ease. Here we have the climber one move in on this boulder. They are actually putting their right foot on the left start hold. Right hand is still on the start hold and then left hand is in this Waco crimp. Already I really like this method. A lot of climbers keep their feet low and then try and match this hold, but here we have the climber skipping a lot of that tedious aspect of this boulder and just plopping their foot right up on this good crimp and laying everything back into this shoulder off of this left hand hold. And then after getting this left hand out, uh, to, uh, this decent hold here, the climber starts to think about, uh, maybe I should put a heel hook where my hand is, maybe I should do something with my feet and ultimately just kind of decided to campus through. So they went right hand and then quick left hand into this jug pinch. And I really liked this level of decision-making from the climber. Um, they knew that if all else fails, you can probably campus through it. And instead of attempting something that feels, um, insecure, the climber just goes ahead and campuses through. They did a good job at reading the boulder, knowing that both of these hands were on and that they were really good. So you don't always have to do the perfect beta to have the most efficient beta. Climbers then able to just own all the weight into this left shoulder and on that really nice foot That was the left-hand start hold they're able to sink in to that position and pretty easily Crossover into this pink hold you'll notice how active this pinch is So you can really come at this hold with a fair amount of heat because of that pinch It's a lot easier to control a hold when you get a thumb opposing the four Main digits on the hand and so already just a very nice method that we're seeing from this climber", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I might keep that guy hand on there a little bit longer, but not bad there. Again, goes off the correct foot. I just wish he would really plant that right foot and really drive that left knee up. He's just choosing to kind of stay just parallel. Both legs are just staying parallel. So, but in a game he might not be able to get this shot off. He needs to just be kind of approach this drill with a little more aggression. Here, you know, it's not a lot of explosiveness. He is going off that left foot. Let's really pull that right hip and really drive that body upward. Here the shooter is shooting a right-hand layup. In this actual movement, he is going off the correct foot. He is shooting with the correct hand on the right side, but we'd love for him to just be more explosive. I feel like he has the ability to lift his body up and really push off this left foot and raise that right hip. He's just kind of going through the motions here a little bit.

That looks really good. Just little teeny steps. I would just lengthen my stride here as I go from side to side. Just have a kind of have an intention and purpose to really cover space as you go.

I would advise having a more higher wrist. You can see the wrist is below the keys almost. Raise this wrist up will allow the fingers to droop a little bit more over the keys for a curved position for a stronger acquisition of notes and keys. Student showed an excellent cross under for the upscale. Playing of these octaves looks really good. You can see that there's more emphasis on the pinky side of the hand here with this concaveness. I would see if they could bring this hand to the center, bring the weight of the hand centered a little bit more, and you can see how it's affecting the wrist angle here. If they were to bring this hand weight over this direction a bit more, this wrist might go this way and fix itself. Might cause pain over long periods of practicing, but this might be necessary for them to reach this octave. You can see they're barely getting that pinky and knowing spot. This hand frame for octaves actually looks really good. Due to the size of her hands, she needs to adjust a further back hand position to achieve the full spread. This is acceptable for a student of this age. You can see here, bending of the fingers at the knuckles in a concave way. They need to be convex in order to play stronger on the keys. Student opts to use a fourth finger instead of the third finger to reach for the E note here. The finger pattern should have a third finger here instead. This is because she's about to play a ring finger in the left hand. Practicing is required here to isolate that moment. Another great example of an ascended left-hand switchover, which is a crossover instead. When the student crosses over, they end up playing both of these keys at the same time. I would advise practicing just that moment to isolate one note for one, or one finger for one note.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Sometimes the phrasing that they choose in one musician isn't followed by the other, and it sounds like they're not together. Tempo very obviously slower here for a much harder moment. Intonation on the violin here is off. Notice here the really short strokes in the viola and the longer bow strokes in the violin. Good example of playing differently, but knowing that it's supposed to sound together. They're matching energies here really well. This thumb tends to be peaking up a little bit too much as well. This musician has an amazing elbow use when getting up to that higher register on a lower string. Elbow should absolutely be up like that. That looks really good. Really excellent ricochet bow stroke here. Uh, Vila was rushing here at the end while the violin was slowing down. These musicians do a good job of being just slightly different with the articulation between them as to still be heard separately without getting lost in the mix between the two. The bow articulation with this section was particularly enjoyable. They're obviously fresh looking at this. Even though this musician here isn't getting all of the notes, he's really good at flubbing it until he can get to the next downbeat. Sign of a good musician who's good at sight reading. Really good following ensemble here These musicians tend just to play fast because they're young. As soon as they slow down, textures, phrasing, even their ensemble drastically increases. They just suffer from too fast of an internal pulse. installation here. I really like the sound and control of the energy here that I'm hearing. Great musicians already off to a good start with their postures, nice and tall spines for both of them, good flexibility in their side-to-side motions. This musician tends to be more up and down this way. Shoulder rest situation for the violas might be a good change. Beal's doing a really good job staying consistent throughout this whole section. I feel like they could follow the phrasing of the violin just a little bit better in order to make the phrasing more cohesive between the two of them. No sense of real tempo in this section other than that it was fast. I love how gentle the very top high pitches are in both instruments and how delicate they sound in the bow. Great intonation with the octaves here in this musician. Good phrasing in the bow and bow control with the feel. Intonation in the violin here again. This musician's thumb is on the top of the bow, which looks really good. And the first finger is curved beautifully over the stick. This is good technique and form on the bow. This sounds really good. They slowed it down and it sounds much better Thumb is pretty collapsed in there, called a banana thumb in grade school.

This boulder, they start matched actually here on the right side. We got this good foot for the left and then a lower right foot and here the climber is kind of playing with the idea of coming in and matching this undercling. I think that this boulder might be easier if you're taller because maintaining the drive to this right foot is pretty imperative to being able to match this undercling and I think it's just a little too low for some of the climbers to feel confident in driving in this undercling. After bailing on trying to undercling, the hold just to the left of the start hold, they try the power sequence. So getting all the way up with their left hand here, and here their foot just picks as they're reaching for the hold. And yeah, it just seems like a lesser of two evils. You either try and maintain this left foot and possibly come up short on the hold, or you go past the foot and it picks and you do get enough reach, but it's hard to hold with no feet.

That way the climber does not lose pressure of the left foot placement and potential being able to get closer to the wall to make the reach. The climber right now is lowering her center of gravity due to having to perform a dynamic move next. As she is glancing over to the hold at reach, she lowers her center of gravity to stay underneath her grips by extending the arms as well as pushing over with the left foot against the hold so that she remains underneath her grips. Now when the climber is ready, she will then engage in a forceful pull up and press down mostly on the right foot to gain direction over to the hold at reach. The climber right now is chucking up and the pouch that she has attached to her is a chalk bag where she places each hand inside of the bag then later spreads them onto the palms. The chalk will help the climber to gain a better grip when sustaining the holds as well as absorbing any moisture that may be coming from her hands. The climber wasn't able to make the hand over to the edge of the hold when performing the reach. A couple things are because the climber must gain more momentum down below when coming off to the dynamic move when pressing to bring the left hand over to the hold at reach. However, we can see how her center of gravity is slightly away from the wall when performing the reach and this is because the climber's left foot has not been adjusted to go over the hold where the climber should have placed the foot slightly above to have the toe roll into the top of the hold. In this case when the climber was transferring over the weight to make the jump in the stance, we can see how the foot is still placed onto the right side and when performing the move the climber wasn't able to bring her hips close to the wall and instead is being slightly pushed away enabling her to make the reach. The climber starts until she is no longer standing on the mat. So she's in her first position, sustaining to a one-hold start, where both hands place into the same hold. This is called matching. The type of hold she's sustaining is called a jug, because the climber is able to wrap the hands around the lip of the hold. Now, the climber needs to transfer over the weight to her placement, the reason why she has brought her hips close to the wall, to transfer it over to press down by the feet. And is able to lean back onto her hand placements to transfer the weight to the grips.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Good placement of the hands and the arms. I'm not sure what's going on here, but the arms are going way high. I'm not sure if that is necessary. It is part of the choreography, but not sure what steps those are. One thing that I noticed is that the dancer keeps swaying back and forth, which might be their own personal style, but the movement should definitely be more in the feet, where the body is moving and the feet are stepping, and the ways in which the body engages in the movement will be based on the isolations and being how the dancer moves those particular areas. So it's less so in the hips swaying and more so in the feet and the isolated parts of the body. This movement is very good. Dancers are in sync. They have a nice distance and connection.

And here he appears to add his seasoning to the cucumber mixture, which is garam masala or cumin or coriander, some Indian seasoning. Now he realizes that he needs to have the mixing bowl to complete this recipe. And again, I'm not certain if this is his working knowledge or this knife just appears to be very dull, but he has a very hard time getting that initial cut lengthwise to go through his cucumber coins. He seems relatively comfortable with this type of cutting board with a knife attached. However, he does have his fingertips right up against the blade of the knife, and it appears that the blade is rather dull. After transferring the tomatoes to the bowl, he then has to transfer the cucumbers from the plate to the bowl. He could have eliminated this step by having the mixing bowl on hand at the beginning of the recipe. This is a slow and very misguided approach to chopping a tomato. Efficiently, you would want to chop it lengthwise and then create lengthwise slices before chopping it across the grain. Here it seems that he's taking each quarter and slowly chopping that into a fine dice. And here, if you look close, you can see at the bottom of the bowl, there is a ton of liquid in this salad. Additionally, he is missing a key ingredient of salt. Maybe there is salt in the seasoning mixture, but it's unclear why salt was not added. Again, whether this is his technique or the dullness of the knife, he seems to have a very hard time slicing this tomato fully with just the blade. He's having to take the vegetable and move it in order to finalize the chop. Obviously, a fourth of a cup of seasoning added on top of one cucumber and one small tomato is too much seasoning. One teaspoon, up to one tablespoon would have been sufficient. Step one of making a cucumber and tomato salad is to gather your tools that you'll use to execute the task and your ingredients. Here he has a cutting board with a knife attached to it. First, he appears to add one teaspoon or one tablespoon. But then he looks like he decides to pour the entire bowl onto the cucumber mixture, which appears to be about a fourth of a cup. That would be way too much acid for this amount of vegetables. Here to note that he transfers the cucumber back to this plate, which is not his mixing bowl. This creates a process where he's moving that product two times. Later in the video, you'll see that he moves it back to the mixing bowl. This indicates to me that he doesn't necessarily know all of the appropriate tools that he needed at the beginning of the recipe. And so he didn't grab the mixing bowl, which creates a two-step process for the cucumbers. This indicates to me that he has not made this recipe prior to this video and that he doesn't have a good working knowledge of the amounts that are consistent in producing this task. Here you can see that he's struggling to get all of his slices into a single line so that he can chop them lengthwise. He grabs one small cucumber and begins to slice it crosswise into half inch or fourth inch thick rounds.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

Can he jump higher? I think so. Love the extension of the elbow, the snapping of the wrists, guide hand is here on the side. Beautiful extension of the hips here on the release. Kind of starting to get off his feet here a little bit. Here's his elbow. The ball's coming off the fingers last. Here's that guide hand. Great job with not putting the guide hand on the ball on the release. So when he catches it, you can see his footwork here. It's really slow. And I don't mean that in a negative way. It's just, it's gonna take him a while to get it off. Therefore he's gonna be defended. So why don't we step this left foot aggressively, bring the right leg in aggressively when you catch it. Here there's just little footwork, just a little small step. He holds it here a little bit too long. Here on the release, he kind of short arms his follow-through a little bit. It's a little bit down too low. Let's get that follow-through up. He also jerks back that non-shooting hand as well, and you can see that in the image here. Let's square these shoulders and hips up. It looks like he turns that right leg in a little bit. Let's get our whole body square to the basket. Again, he catches it because he's not really ready to catch and shoot. So when he catches it, there's like a hesitation or a pause here. And just that split second, that pause is going to cause a defender to then now defend you. So we got to be quicker stepping in and meeting the pass. And then we got to catch and shoot a little bit quicker here. You see the footwork, his feet are really close together. My recommendation is to really step in with that left foot, pull the right foot up and then elevate. Here it's just a little bit too slow. Here you see him, here's the pass coming his way. He's kind of upright. His feet are together. Again, in this drill, my recommendation is the shooter drop his hips, bend his knees, and step one, two to meet this pass to get more lift and elevation and make it more game-like. Ultimately, that's what we want to do in these drills. Go game, speed. Again, he takes a little extra step here with his right foot, therefore it's out here in front. Again, let's square our hips to the basket. I like how the ball's sitting back on his shooting hand. He's caught that wrist back. Guide hand is here on the side. Again, here's the release. Beautiful follow-through extension of the right shooting arm. Wrist snaps down. You see all four fingers pointing down to the floor. That's really, really nice. Guide hand is not in the shot. It's here on the side. Pretty good verticality here. Start to see a little air under his feet, which is good. Here's the release. Pretty good extension here of the right shooting elbow. You see that that arm, it kind of followed through a little bit across his body instead of straight on. Again, let's get this left elbow of the non-shooting arm parallel to the floor. This is really nice. Beautiful extension, snapping of the wrist, fingers down, guide hand on the side. My only continued recommendation is let's get this elbow, the non-shooting hand, elbow in. It kind of goes out a little bit. Again, let's square this, our feet and this right hip facing more to the basket. But the ball looks like it's leaving the hand, has good, good arc to the basket. Here are the shooters shooting a 15-footer. Beautiful extension of the right elbow, the shooting arm. You can see in the egocentric view. Pretty perfect. Beautiful extension. Snapping down of the shooting wrist. The fingers are pointing down and spread. Has nice arc on the ball to the basket. The guide hand, the palm of that guide hand, that non-shooting hand is facing inward. My only recommendation is I bring that left elbow in and have that forearm more parallel to the ground. Pretty good lift here. This right hip may be turned in just a tad on this shot, but good extension and elevation here. I probably could lift up even more if he would prepare a little bit more ahead of time and meet that pass and drive those hips into the shot. Here's where he raises it up. He does bend his knees here a little bit. Here the shooting elbow looks like it's a little bit out. Let's bring that elbow in under the ball. In this view, it does really look like he's bringing the ball really a little bit back behind his head. You'd like to shoot it from the forehead. Again, waiting to meet this pass, he kind of just standing straight up. He does have his hands up. We'd love to see him backstop it with his right hand right here, because that's his shooting hand, and just that guide hand can just help bring it into that right hand. But let's let's bend our knees, let's drop our hips, let's get our feet apart and really step into this pass. Here comes the shot. He's got a pretty good hand placement on the ball. You can see the shooting hand and the fingers spread on the ball. His guide hand is here on the side. I do like that his feet are now apart. He's stepping a little bit with the right foot forward. I would love for him to jump up vertically, to go up straight. Here the elbows have a tendency to kind of pop out a little bit. Let's bring these elbows in under the basketball. Here comes the pass. You could see he's really just kind of waiting for the ball. He's not going to meet it with a with I call a one-two step. And again, the reason you want to meet this pass is you don't want a defender to step in there in a game situation between you and the ball and steal it. So you got to meet your pass in any of those situations. I like that he's got his hands out. He's starting to reach his hands out, but let's extend them more out to meet the pass. Again, beautiful extension of the right arm, the shooting arm and hand. Here, the fingers may be a little close together, but not bad. I love the inside of that palm of that non-shooting hand facing in. Again, let's move the elbow of that guide hand, the non-shooting arm in. I really feel like, again, this player could get more lift and legs in his shot. He's barely getting off the floor. I think he has a capability of lifting and elevating and shooting that ball at the height of his jump.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

It just needs to be one fluid motion here. But love this, love this, excellent. here you know what a lot of shooters do this just really pushing off the left foot and like fading back sometimes they watch too much of the pros doing all this but you know it looks good but you know he's weights needs to be more evenly distributed I love that he's lifting off the ground beautiful extension here doesn't get any better than that let's get that left elbow in palm facing inward it looks really nice he's just falling backwards a little bit could throw off the shot Again, I just can't emphasize this as much as possible. Like, just being a ready shooter, like, you know, it's hard to really execute this drill to the 10 unless you're really stepping in and meeting this pass, bending your body down, having your weight down, bending your knees, dropping your hips. But, you know, at the end of the day, he's got his hands ready. He's a right-hand shooter. Let's backstop it with his right hand. It's a lot quicker. You catch it, shot. If he catches it with his left hand, then he's got to move it to his right hand. And that second or two can cause the defense to guard you. And you're not going to get your shot off. Here he kind of steps to the left a little bit on his landing. You know, at the end of the day, you just you want as little movement as possible. You know, you want to go straight up, straight down, be real soft on the balls of your feet on the landing, hold that follow-through. You just want it to be one simple movement. Any extra, like, you know, jerking back, falling backward, falling one side the other is going to throw off the accuracy of the shot. Again, not a lot of lift. If he could step more into this pass, he could get more jumping. But this looks really, really good here. Flexion here, elbows at 90 degrees, the ball sits back on his hand to shoot it. He's got his fingers spread. Really nice. Here he receives the pass. He kind of bends his knees in together a little bit, kind of as he crouches to shoot it. You want more of an explosive, like step into this pass and one, two, and lift. Here he kind of squeezes the knees together to get his power. This is really good. I like this. Elbow in maybe just a tad, but this looks really good with his hand behind the ball and that guide hand is just offering some token pressure there to help raise it and lift it for the shot. Here, again, he's going off this left foot. Again, just let's evenly distribute our weight here. Beautiful beginning of the extension of the arm. The ball comes off the pads of the fingers. Look how they're nicely spread. And that guide hand looks pretty good. Again, gets the ball up to the height of his jump. This is really, really, really nicely done. The landing, he kind of falls backwards here a little bit. You really couldn't see it here, but again just, you know, bend those knees. Let's get, let's get our body a little bit more square. Get these shoulders facing the basket. Again, he's kind of turned a little bit to the inside or to the left. Beautiful shot, beautiful extension. Let's get that guide hand here on the side, elbow in. But I start to see some air there. But really relying on pushing off with that left foot. I would really recommend going off two feet. Here the shooter receives the pass. You know, he's got his feet staggered, but I would love for him to drop his hips and then lift his body. He kind of steps with his right foot here a little bit more. I love the fact that he gets the ball up high quickly. This is really nice here with the ball sitting on his shooting right hand, elbows bent. This is what it should look like. I'm trying to see if this is his guide hand. It's on the side, just token pressure there. Again, he kind of bends his knees inward. Let's evenly distribute this weight so we can catch and go straight up. This looks really good. It's more of what he's doing before he catches it because once he's caught it, it looks really good. here his weight he kind of falls back again a lot of the weight falls on the left foot I can tell just slightly again let's bend those knees hold that follow through Here's the release. So, I mean, he could jump even higher if he would step into it. That's why I say that. But he's got pretty good... he's elevating here a little bit. I love it that his hips are extended. Beautiful. Better extension of the shooting arm. Great breaking of the wrists. Let's get this guy's elbow, this left arm, get this elbow parallel to the floor, that forearm parallel to the floor. But looks good. Here you go, just really pushing off the left foot, throwing that right leg up. He's feeling it here, I think, but, you know, falling backwards, I think it's the last shot of the drill, but love his extension, love his energy, enthusiasm here. Beautiful follow through as the ball elevates to the basket. Again, he kind of short arms it. Let's hold this follow through high and lengthen that elbow. When he lands, he kind of is a little straight legged. Let's bend those knees. Keep our body square or facing the basket. Looks like he kind of turned a little bit to the left. Let's stay square. That means keep your shoulders and hips facing the basket. So, on the follow-through, let's extend this shooting elbow more. I just sometimes call this short arm in it, where you kind of hitch it back. The guide hand looks pretty good, but let's extend this elbow. Let's break that. He's got the wrist broken. Just extend that elbow more. He's got some extension here. Leaves the ground just a little bit. I think he can get more power and lift if he would step more into this pass.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So both hands on the same hold this is called matching and the climber does this position in a way so that he can find a way to lay back. Next hand to be released could potentially be the lower one as the climber will need to extend out right. Here we can see the climber sort of testing the holes before getting onto the wall. The right hand is positioned as a normal grip where the fingers will slide into the donut and the thumb is used as for a pinch to sustain the hold. And on the other side, the climber as he's getting lowered has placed the palm to be facing up with the fingers sliding into the donut as well. But it seems as that would not be ideal for the start move. Here we can see the climber, his hand position was not the best. That's because both of the grips were stacking one on top of the other, creating unnecessary pressure done by the left hand that was above and pressuring the top of the right hand. That is not a very comfortable position as it's like over gripping and can hurt the hand for the climber or even worse, not be able to release the right hand for the move. Here we can see the climber getting himself positioned, each hand holding onto a donna. This is called a two-hold start. Now as we can see the climber has flipped the right hand to be also gripped with the thumb being supported for a pinch. Once the climber gets to hold onto the grips above, it's keeping the arms extended. This way it can add more pressure to the grips above.

Be able to just kind of apply all that pressure through it. And that's going to free his right hand just to come up, up and over and hit this handhold. Again, works on this nice back flake, so he's right hand on, right foot. So he flakes this left foot back behind him. Still not a super rigid, so a little bent, so you could kind of clean that up and really sink down into it. But that kind of lets him bounce out, so he can just kind of casually reach up with his left hand. He does a good job of when he cuts his feet and then recovers, he kind of saves his body to the left so he's kind of underneath this hold more. So he can kind of relax and play around with his feet and get his feet where they need to go. And this kind of move seems like it wastes a little bit of energy. He hangs out one arm quite a bit and kind of just lets his left hand drop down before kind of slowly adjusting and going up to this big hold. So he could probably move a little bit faster, keep both his hands on. And by doing that he's able to really kind of Get his sequence on his hands And he's kind of does this crossover so instead of matching he's kind of getting his hands swapped on there So that higher right spot might or the higher left spot for his right hand might be a little bit more positive Which kind of ease up and let him go up to this next hole a little bit easier I like this move so he could go off this lower foot and drive up and over to this handhold, but he opts to use his heel hook. So he's going to replace this hand, he's going to be able to pull straight through that hold, take all that tension. And so then he cuts his feet, I think just by balancing on keeping a little extra tension not having that other leg flop around, you could kind of prevent a lot of these foot cuts. And then again he's dropping the hand down. So he's kind of wasting energy. And he's not really using this left foot for anything. This left foot's kind of just dangling. It's almost back plaguing, but he could just keep it a lot more rigid, let it post into the wall, and let it kind of drive him to the left. But he's kind of opting out of that. So he kind of unintentionally maybe goes into the backflip a little bit, but he goes up left hand, but he's got his right hand, right foot, and his left foot kind of kicks back around. So that's kind of his body just kind of bouncing out. I'm not sure if it was on purpose or if it just kind of flung that way and just kind of bounced out on its own. But he does work on a little backflip there to get a little more control on that left hand. So then again, cuts his feet again, but he's on two positive holds, so it doesn't seem as bad. But it does look like maybe he's getting tired and not as good at holding the tension as he moves through the row. But the handles are big enough that he's still able to hold on and keep going. And then again, he's right hand, right foot, so his left leg is kind of just dangling out here so he could kind of straighten it out, kind of smear into the wall and push, create tension with it or you get the balance out. And so just let it flop around. I like this, how he readjusts so there may not be room for his left hand, so he goes back down to this lower hand hold to kind of pace himself and set himself up for the next move. So he kind of recycles that hold with his left hand. It's really nice, he kind of gains control of his hold and he kind of segs down off of it so that way he's not really fighting it. He's able to kind of relax into it to kind of readjust.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This can compromise the climb as the climber will have to over grip to sustain herself from falling and trying to recover the move. However, we can see from the left hand how the depth of that lip of the hold is more positive than the right hand grip that she's sustaining above. the clambor and switching the feet with keeping the left leg extended. This is called flagging out and is to control hair position and balance when performing the next move. However, the left hand seems to have lost grip pressure so the clambor is reapplying the grip onto the hold. This one is a slight jog but because the lip is sticking out and is not as far in depth to be positioned upright, the clambor is actually pinching into the hold and it's important that she pulls it over in the right direction which means that she needs to keep the elbow down and close to the wall to sustain the grip. And once the clambor is able to apply the pinch, then the clambor will be able to lean back to transfer over the weight to the grips. The climbers are starting at a one-hole start and as we can see both of the hands are placed into the same hole. This is called matching. The climber places it over a jug where it has an indent where the climber can place the fingers behind the lip of the hole. Now the climber starts until the feet are no longer standing on the mat and are placed onto the wall. In this case, the climber had brought the left foot to come into place first and brings the right foot at a high stance, looking at the next hole at reach. The climber has come in contact with the mat due to loosened pressure of the feet, which means that the climb has ended. Now, if the climber was to attempt this move again, it's important that the climber immediately, when placing the left foot onto the hold, she continues to apply pressure of the right toe to stay in place. And once the climber secures the left toe placement, then she can release with control the right foot. As we can see the climber had sent the right foot back out to the original hold where she had placed the right foot and Has dropped the left foot from its place with the leg extended This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place And having the flag helps the climber to also Support and keeping the center of gravity close to the wall as she performs the twist of her shoulders To bring the right shoulder up to send The hand to the hold that reach Now as we can see the climber can remain underneath the hold that reach being in this position however, we can see her fingers are being placed above the hold and She wraps the thumb around the edge of that hold to sustain the grip. This is a flat surface type of hold so the climber must Continue to close the grip in order to create friction of the skin Towards the hold once the climber gets to find the catch then she will be able to lean back To transfer over the weight to the highest grip At this moment the climber is glancing down, retracting the right foot placement to bring it over to a match at the foot chip Where she brings the right toe to come into place at the hold. This one being a small, the climber is being metatautical by swiveling the left foot out So the climber can get to place the toe of the right foot above the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Ideally, the bench would be a lot wider here, and they could actually move with their hands and get rid of this kink here. I don't think this would normally be their position if they were sitting in an appropriate chair. Really excellent posture sitting. Like they could be a little closer to the edge of the chair, but the spine is nice and tall with a slight lean forward to show that they're rested there.

She's tapping with the toe as she steps out and I think there could be a bit more movement in her shoulders just to kind of change up the movements a bit more as well as moving her hips side to side as she steps. Here she steps forward. This left knee can be bent as she steps out. She is stepping on the ball of her feet, which is great. And again, a little bit more fluidity and movement in her upper body as well as her hips can move a bit more side to side. Here, nice job with a nice little roll. Her arms are extended above her head really well. She's sitting in this right leg, which is straight, and then the left leg, the toe is positioned on the floor with the left leg slightly bent in the knee. And then a nice roll throughout her mid-range body. So here the dancer starts just stepping in place and then stepping out to the side. She has the ball of her foot on the floor. I think the knees could be bent a bit more in this area just to provide a bit more grounding to the movement, but her arm is nicely placed out to the side as she stretches it out. So here, nice job in the kind of a jazz square step as she steps across and around and then jumps out to this position. So nice knee bent here in the leg that she's standing on, her right leg. This left leg is stretched out with the toe pointed nicely. And then her arms are stretched out in a diagonal and her eyes are looking forward. So great job there. So here, really nice turn. I love that her arms are extended nicely up over her head as she spins around and she's also spotting with their head as she spins. But again, I think a little bit more fluidity throughout her full body, just moving side to side, adding her hips and also bending the knees as she turns around. So here as she starts to travel a little bit, she's moving side to side in the step. Again, I think bending the knees would help a lot, but I do like that she is standing on the balls of her feet.

So their head moves really sharp and then their body follows quickly. So I mentioned it earlier in the video, so I wanted to spot out or highlight that this is a great example of that. Here, in order to save and conserve their energy, I would encourage them to bend their knees and engage their core in order to exert less energy for this intermediate salsa. I would encourage the dancer to be very clear on when they should be on the balls of their feet versus when they should be flat-footed. This would encourage with the buoyancy and energy throughout the movement because they're doing all this amazing work and all this footwork and in demonstrating such musicality and attention to detail in their arms and engaging that core, but really being clear on whether their articulation of the feet would take it to the next level and save them some energy in this intermediate salsa. Here the dancer uses their arm a lot and they're pretty sharp when they use their arm. To further encourage the sharpness that we've seen in previous videos, I would encourage them to continue to pay close attention from their wrists all the way to their fingertips and make sure that that has as much energy as their arms do so it looks like a great attention to detail. I would encourage the dancer to think about the quality of breath because they're so great at executing the movement. So think about how the breath can give longevity or agility to the movement so they don't feel tired or out of breath as they looked in the first section of the video, because they're doing all this incredible work, but breath control will help them maintain doing this great, amazing work. Here for the scoop unders that they do, kind of scoop with their arms and then scoop and their their legs are moving side to side so they go scoop with the arms and scoop with the arms. I would encourage them to take bigger steps so they can plie or bend their legs even further so their scoop almost touches the ground like they're holding a bowl and then they can scoop again and touch the ground like they're holding a bowl and come up even bigger. This would give it more dynamic quality and is more closer to the roots of salsa and it's like African aesthetic and technique so digging into getting closer to the grounds would help with that dynamic quality and intermediate salsa and pay homage to its roots. Here, the dancer does a really great job of doing isolations or moving one part of their body at a time. They go backside, front, arm, arm, head, roll. And so, in order to do that more efficiently, I would encourage them to be very sharp on what they're doing and over anticipate their movements. But overall, really great job. Here, I would encourage the dancer to be quicker about spotting their head or quicker on what direction they want to turn. So you look first and then you turn. So I would, when they look, I would encourage them to look even quicker and even sharper in order to be able to turn faster. This would give them more efficiency of movement and allow them to again turn quicker.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

To do this, the climber avoiding from swinging out completely, he will need to create body tension, meaning engage the core and bring the feet up. However, because the climber stood up lastly on the right foot to press and driving his direction away from the wall, we can see how his body has been shifted to have his chest face the opposite side. This because the climber had engaged forcefully on the reach. So this automatically will make his body face the opposite direction of the reach. So in this instance, the climber must force the grip in order to sustain the move. It's important that when the climber finally gets to engage on the stance, the climber pulls himself in as much as he can. This to bring his center of gravity with him to get as close as he can to the wall. It's important that he will bring then his chest first in to then the hips to follow while he pushes down on the feet to generate a jump up to the hold. The climbers is starting it at a two hand hold start, meaning that each hand has its own hold and as we can see both of them are donuts. Meaning that the right hand hold at least is curved in so the climber is able to sustain a positive grip, meaning that he's able to wrap the hand around it by keeping the thumb on the outside to generate more force when on the grip. On the left hand, the donut is not as positive, but in order to create pressure he places the fingers on the inside and leans back to create pressure on the hold. The climb will start until the climber's feet are on the wall, which he is doing right now and this is his first positioning. As we can see the right foot is placed on a positive hold, meaning a big hold that he can place his entire toe box over it. And now the climber's feet are on the wall, then the climb starts. Here, the swing has been more powerful than the climber being able to apply pressure on the grip, which is making the climber now lose pressure at the grip by having a feeling of getting peeled off due to slightly having his elbow already not underneath where the climber's hand placement is. This will create a peel motion and as the climber is already making himself way down, the right foot will be positioned on the mat and the climb will be over. The moment that the climber stepped up on the right foot, which was the highest foot placed, you can see how the climber first was going parallel with the wall on his body. And the moment he stepped, he shifted his direction slightly out. This will continue to send the climber away from the wall if he doesn't get to make the reach by palming the hold above. Here we can see the climber swinging forcefully. This is so that the climber is able to generate power before going up for an explosive stance, meaning that the climber will need to leap up in the air to make the reach up to this big green hold. This is called a dyno. So the climber will be leaping up in the air for a matter of seconds, not touching any holes until he makes a placement of the right hand up to the hold. It's important that the climber aims exactly which area of the edge he's trying to get at as it will be necessary for sustaining the move.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And then I would anticipate maybe on the left, since she took two more counts, but she did like a different kind of pull and then she claps and then she did a stretch, right? So again, I would have liked for her to finish that movement. It felt like she did the two on one side and then she just decided, I'm going to do something else. And so I think to execute the movement more fully and to really feel that and be in tune with the music, I would have chosen to do it both the right side and the left side and then gone into the stretch and then the clap. Maybe the clap is a four count, going right, left, right, left. Maybe the stretch in the middle is a four count, a right, a left, a right, left. After the two essence pulls to the right and two to the left. So really completing that movement and committing to it and not changing it up before you would really round out the sequence. So, overall, I think that the dancer had pretty good execution in terms of just moving and utilizing steps that I would find familiar in this movement vernacular with social dancing and looking at some Lindy Hop swing dancing. However, again, I could see there was some improvisation happening, and therefore she was thinking about the movement and not just hitting the movement and hitting it clearly with the extension of arms or the feet and things like that. That's something that I would pick up on. So in a context of just in general, just making sure you know where your body is going and what steps that you're executing and being clear of whatever the sequence is. But then, you know, if it is choreographic, then I would speak specific to the choreography being executed or not and hitting certain movements. So, again, the dancer is trying different movements, not really completing them on either side. I noticed that she goes right into a kick very strongly, which is great, but then realizes that if she doesn't slow down, she's going to lose the beat. So I'm seeing that in the movement when she brings the leg down. I've seen this a couple of times. So she'll sustain that. And that is fine, but she could also keep going and add another step in there as well to make sure that she keeps time with the music. So that was another good example as the dancer is reaching and she's looking. Her hands are going to different positions, right? So again, if this were something that was choreographed or that was a specific step, then she's reaching right and she's reaching left. She's reaching right, she's left, but she's still going to the same place. I feel like she's going in different levels with her arms in the spaces she's turning. So you're not really sure where she's going with those spaces. And then if this is a dance, dancing that she's doing with a partner, it's very difficult for me to see if she's leading or following or if she is dancing solo, right? So if say she's following, where would the hands be or the steps be as if it were a puzzle on the other side of her, this other person dancing, where would that person be fitting into the things that she's doing as she's moving about? So I'm not exactly sure if I'm describing this correctly in terms of what I'm assessing and seeing and analyzing in terms of me not being sure. Like I need more context, right? Is this something she'd be doing with someone? Is this a stylized jazz dance? Is this social dancing, something that's like the Lindy Hop or the Big Apple? Are we looking at specific steps and executing steps or just how she's executing movement? Because to me, these are not specific. These are specific steps as in I could see a step ball change or I can see a kickball change, a shuffle. I can see steps in that way, but with the phrasing and the sequencing, the steps are quite short. It's hard to see what the phrasing is or what is being communicated with the phrasing, if I'm saying this clearly enough, with some of the steps. I also think she could do steps a little longer so that we can really identify what it is that she's doing or she's saying with the body, with the steps. She's changing a bit. So it's kind of hard again to see what the phrasing is and where it begins and where it ends. And that doesn't always shift with the movement changes because a phrase can change movements, but it's really also about how it fits with the music. Okay, so this was a good example. I think she did the step where she was swinging her arms right and left, then she steps forward. She's still coming down a diagonal going towards the left, down diagonal towards the viewer. And then she kind of brings out the arms from the chest and opens and she does it twice. And then she goes backwards and she does the movement again versus stepping on the left to do the same movement on the left, which would have taken up the same four counts, but she changed the movement, which again, she's bringing in different movements and variations, but not really completing it on one side from the next, which would I think even out the movement a bit better. And it would also just take up the steps and the counts because when you have a four, four, you're counting usually eight counts, a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So if you do the first four going to the right, one, two, three, four, you can do that movement on the left side of five, six, seven, eight, or do something else. That's a five, six, seven, eight. But what I'm finding is she might go into a five, six, seven and step into an eight to do the next movement instead of on the one. And so that's where I'm saying that she could balance that a little bit better. I could probably show you what I'm saying more clearly. So doing my best to try to verbally describe what I'm seeing, but that is how I would suggest for the dancer to execute that movement. Furthermore, if the dancer is clear about where they're going, the movement is done more fuller out, it's done with more confidence and more energy and less inhibition or apprehension. Thank you. The dancer is doing great with adding her head, with the movement where she's doing the two-step and adding the arms to sway. When she starts to do the quarter turns and what looks to be a kickball change or stepball change, it was really the first two were more alike. And then the third one, she did like a harder stop. And then the fourth one went back to the first two. Usually if you're doing a movement like that, you're doing the same movement on all four sides in a quarter turn. So I would have liked to see that just to make sure that it's very clear, all the steps. And then one might go back the other direction to round that out. She's turning quite a bit on the right side here. Even though the third step was a harder step, it also was differentiated from the other two steps by what looked like a shuffle almost. Like again, going into maybe a tap movement, like a shuffle ball change. Whereas in jazz, you might have a step ball change. A shuffle would be creating that sound that we heard there. Another example here that I'm referring to is what I would refer to as an essence pull, where she brings both of the arms out. Usually you want to pull in the hip to the right or to the left, whichever direction you're going, and you want to move right or left with the feet, the legs. She's moving somewhat back on a diagonal and kind of making it a slide, and that's fine. Again, it's hard to say, okay, is that a specific step or is that movement? So if I'm looking at this and saying, if you want to achieve an essence pull in this sequence and that's choreographic or that's where we want to place that, my direction would be to fully step out on the right and stretch the right arm over the top of the head, over to the left side of the body, and really lean into that to the right, and then do the same thing on the left. Even if you're doing those double time steps that she's doing, right, right, and left, because she's going back, it's hard to see, okay, is it that essence pull that I think it is, or is this something different? And then if it is something different, and I do appreciate how she did it both on the right side and the left side, then what is that? Maybe it's supposed to be going in that diagonal because that is a step that she's created or that's a movement and that's fine, but not really identifying the exact step that that person is doing, that this dancer is doing, it's a little difficult to say, is that person doing it correctly? I would just say, again, all the movement needs to be fuller, fully extended and fuller on the top part of the body, just as much as you're doing the steps with the feet, really stretching the arms and releasing in the chest and holding the head up and those types of things would be some of my corrections and tips if I'm looking to help guide somebody through a sequence that looks like that, because you want to see confidence, you want to see the joy, you want to see that somebody's having a good time. You want to, again, going to this African aesthetic and these canons, there's a certain level of confidence and vibrato, if you will, there's a certain approach to the movement at any level that shows that you're really enjoying yourself, right? Because if this is social dance and this is cultural, then this is really about expressing oneself and in a heightened state of joy or excitement. A lot of these dances come out of resilience and beauty and connection and community. That's what we want to see in the body with those movements and being very intentional and clear again, because if you're dancing with somebody, that other person needs to know where you're going in space and be able to anticipate that as well. Another example of this is it's not very clear if the dancer is pushing her arms out, stretching her arms out into like both being fully extended to create a T, or she's just kind of moving through the space. So again, we want to be intentional with the way that we're directing our movement. So if you're extending your arms, it should be a full extension and everything should be straight from the fingertips all the way across to the other fingertips, right? So no bends in the elbows and being very direct versus having a bend in the elbow and also just the direction of the hands. If you're stretching out, is the path that you're pushing the air and then dropping the hands? Are you extending it fully? So that's what I just mean by the commitment is just trying to understand where she's really going with her hands and her arms. Her feet definitely seem to be more clear, but directionally and with the energy, I want to see the effort being more intentional and direct and her just being aware of, okay, where am I placing my arms? If this was choreography, where would those arms go? To me again, she's improvising. So she's just kind of moving her arms in a direction to sway along with the feet, but she's going to make the movement, make it with intention and make it very clear. Another example is the reaching out in the quarter turn. So the dancer begins to reach out just with her right arm, bringing her arm back in, bending her elbow. And then when she gets to maybe the third one, she adds the other arm. And it wasn't clear in the first two if her arm was really fully out there or she was thinking about it. And so it turned into both arms. So maybe because it was a quarter turn, in my mind, I would like to see both of those arms going out in each of those quarters turn steps, really facing each of the corners or the quarter, if you think about a pie or a clock, and just being intentional with the movement as she turned around in that circle. Dancers begins with moving her shoulders and catching the rhythm of the music. And then she steps out to, I believe it is the left. And then I saw a little bit of a, I don't know if it was apprehension on the movement or a thought to go in a different direction, but the direction she went. So I did see a little, it's not really a mistake, but it's more that she was thinking to do something, but she went in a different direction or did a different step, which is what I am seeing. Again, there is the improvisation. The dancer is trying out the different movements and executing on the steps. It does, in some aspects, I would say a tip would really be to just the dancer to be very clear about where they're going and what the movement is that they're executing so that it doesn't seem like they're thinking about it or holding back. That's what's coming through a little bit there. Then also, it seems at this point, the dancer is anticipating the music ending. There are moments where I notice the dancer probably could have finished. They strike the pose and then realize, oh, I need to keep going, which is fine, just saying that I picked up on that. What's helpful is to, again, it was nice the dancer was listening to the music in the beginning, but just have an idea about where the music is ending if you're improvising or what that can look like, or even having a transitional step in there. Again, because this isn't choreography to me from what I see from my experience. If it should be choreography, then it's easy for me to say, okay, this step is not accurate because this is the choreography or this is the specific step. The dancer is moving and improvising, so some of it is subjective in the sense that, okay, this is the dancer's choice to do this or to do that. However, my perspective is that when they are doing some of these movements that they're improvising, they do need to be more intentional and stronger in their movement, more convicted, more committed to carrying the movement out so that it is clear and that it does not seem that the dancer is unsure about the movement. Overall, though, I do think that the dancer knows how to move their body, they know how to execute steps, and they know how to incorporate their body and be rhythmic with the music and the movement. Another step, a point here along the same lines, and pointing this out because it shows how it does impact the movement, is just the twist from the dancer. It's not clear where her feet are stepping. She is sort of moving both right and left, and so she has great groove, and she's listening to the music and it's rhythmic, but hard to see where her feet should be, right? When she's just kind of moving in the space. Because even when you're improvising, even when you're dancing by yourself, you know where your body is going, you know where your feet might be going in the space. I think about some other dance forms that do include improvisation, that maybe like folkloric dances, for example, even though there's improvisation there, it's still being done within a structure. So when she's doing this shift here, this twist, what is the structure? She could have still had her feet in the same placement and been in the center, and she's just rotating her knees from side to side and her hips in opposition, but she's keeping her feet in the same place. So we're very clear about where she is in the space versus her feet picking up and being in different places as they land. It doesn't seem as organized in the body or in the space, even though the movement can still be executed. And so maybe that was the goal for that kind of step. And then I would just say, keep the feet together, parallel, right underneath the hips, twisting and rotating so that it's clear what the dancer is doing. Another example of that is just even on the hand claps, right? So I think that those hand claps could be stronger. The arms could have been held more taut. The elbows could have been at a stronger angle. I felt like it was a little bit of a, for lack of a better word, it was a weaker clap, as in it wasn't done with as much strength or force to bring our hands really together. And a lot of times with movement, when you have accents, right, where you can stomp. And she did a really good stomp in the quarter turns on that third turn. But even in the claps, just being very intentional and using some strength behind that movement. And again, it could just have been because she wasn't sure if that's where she wanted to go. Or she did do that, and she was thinking more about her feet. And so we want to have that same energy throughout the whole body to mirror what the top is doing with the bottom, particularly in this kind of movement. Again, that is based in African aesthetic, even though you're doing isolated movements, right? So you're moving those hands independently of the feet. They can still be on the same beat, but you still want it to be strong and carry the same energy throughout the body simultaneously. The dancer has great execution with the movement. She's lifting the knees high, she's kicking. So that's very clear with the steps. I can tell because she's not doing the steps on both sides of the body that she might be thinking about doing the next thing and then kind of jumping right into it before she finishes a sequence. So she's gonna do a kickball change on the right. And that's like a four count. She's going into another movement that might have a three count versus a four count. She could have repeated the movement on that other side to complete the roundness of the movement. And also I noticed she stepped to turn on a right side or a left side when again, that I would have sequentially just thought for her to move, to finish a step or sequence that she started. She's keeping the rhythm very well and being clear with the steps. But again, for me, I can see that she's improvising. It's a bit evident that she's doing that and thinking about what to do next and executing on it. But she's kind of will do this step, I'll say once and then again. And the second time seems a little bit clearer because maybe she feels like, okay, this is what I'm gonna be doing. And I feel a little bit more confident in that movement. The dancer is doing great. This is a nice two-step here. She's adding snaps and swaying the arms. The arms are not executing the same, going to the same place as they swing right to left to their height or to their high point, but she is swinging at the same time. So I could tell like when she started to do it, she thought about doing it and then as she started to continue or she as she continued, she started to kind of get her groove with it and then felt a little bit more carefree with it and confident. And then I can see her hands swaying in the visual from the egocentric view there. I do like how the dancer is coordinating the top half of her body with the bottom half, which does help one to keep the rhythm and show interconnectedness between the top and the bottom part of the body and to keep step.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Here you can see that he has a black pepper grinder and he is going to grind that directly into his salad. I always recommend using a measuring spoon when seasoning a salad so that you know exactly how much seasoning you're adding to the finished dish. He eyeballs about a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar and pours that directly into the mixing bowl. This is the acid that he's using in this dish, which is a key component to a cucumber and tomato salad. However, again, I would like to see him use a measuring spoon or a liquid measuring cup to determine how much to add. A tablespoon or two is adequate for a salad of this size. It's here that you can see that he has like just very average knife skills Outside of the fact that he's seated which is a very awkward position to be Executing these tasks. He doesn't seem very comfortable with the knife and he doesn't seem like he has any Rama reason or technique To what he's doing It's just very random He is grabbing each tomato, it looks like a grape tomato, out of this container here one by one and cutting it in half crosswise. He continues this motion over and over and over again until he has his onions chopped or minced to his liking. Here you can see that once all of his vegetables are cut, he moves them by hand in batches from the cutting board to this mixing bowl. He actually would be better served by holding the bowl underneath the table here and dragging all of the vegetables directly from the cutting board down into the mixing bowl. It would be much more efficient that way. Then he slices it into half-inch thick slices and then proceeds to do the same technique as he did with the onions which is holding the tip of the knife down on the cutting board with his left hand and moving the knife up and down in a backwards and forwards motion across all of the cucumbers that are that are sliced. After cutting off about a half inch thick tip from this cucumber section, he cuts it in half lengthwise. The first step to making a cucumber and tomato salad is to gather all of your ingredients that you will need for the recipe and to set up your workspace. You can see here that he has a cutting board and a chef's knife here in front of him. He is sitting in a chair which is never recommended when you're cutting anything. You need to be standing up on flat feet at a workspace that's at an adequate level for your height. However, he does have his ingredients handy. He has some pre-sliced red onion here that he is grabbing from a bowl and transferring to the cutting board in batches. His last step is tossing all of the ingredients to combine, which he is doing here with a metal spoon. This is an appropriate tool selection for this task. Here you can see that he is adding a pinch of salt, which I assume to be about an eighth of a teaspoon, which would be a sufficient amount of salt for this recipe. However, again, I would like to see him use a measuring spoon to execute this task. He cuts off about a three inch section of a small baby cucumber and sets the balance aside for another time. Once his onions are chopped to his liking, he groups them on one section of the cutting board here. He should probably at this point have transferred the onions to his mixing bowl so that he would have adequate room to work on the next vegetable, which is his tomatoes. Holding the knife down with his left hand here, he holds the tip of the knife down on the cutting board and with his right hand he moves in an up-and-down motion across the surface of the cutting board. Obviously all of the onions are underneath the knife and are getting diced. This is actually a reasonable way to dice onions if your onion starts from a pre-sliced state.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

Here she's moving backwards in space with her right leg and she's leading with her toe first. This is helping her remain mobile. The dancer should make sure her focus remains forward for the entirety of the dance routine, even if she's reaching towards the end here, instead of looking downward at the floor in her hand. On this box step the dancer could be covering a lot more ground. She kind of stays in the same vicinity But this is a traveling step so she really could travel far over to her right and back around To just cover a greater portion of the studios and she has a space available to her that would make her dancing more exciting Again, every dance step the dancer is doing is leading on her toe first. So this is why she's able to cross over, cross behind, and come back around in the direction that she is doing easily with her heels off the ground. The dancer keeps her weight on her toe when she turns. Her heel is in the air and that's helping her be able to get around on the floor without any friction. The dancer tilts her chin a bit down here and lowers her gaze slightly. We see more of the floor in her ego view. She should make sure that she keeps her eyes straight level in front of her, especially since she's about to turn. She doesn't want to do any head movements like tilting her chin downward because that can make her more dizzy and also throw her off balance. The dancer can improve this movement by changing her focus to be looking in the direction in which she's extending her arm. So because she's extending her arm to the left, she should also be looking to the left. The dancer is inconsistent with her focus. When she walked to the right side of the room, she was looking to the right, but now as she walks the left side of the room, she's looking forward. So she should just be consistent. Either would be fine, but it doesn't seem like she's very much so concentrating on her focus, which she should be. These basic dance steps, the dancer could also travel more as well. She could be traveling further forward to the center than further backwards just to make her dance more exciting especially because she's a dancer who has long limbs. She has long arms and legs so she really should be using those to her advantage since they're a resource for her. The dancer does a great job of distributing her weight on her toes when she's sliding out to the side Her weight is on the toes.

So he would overall benefit from some refinement and some clarity in the use of the upper body. However, in his lower body, he's also maintaining quite disconnect, a lot of disconnection from the rhythm. He's taking very large steps, which you can see his foot elevated quite significantly off the ground here, and bending his knees a little bit too deeply for what the movement would call for, which is overall making his movements appear slow and quite jumbled in relation to the rhythm. As the dancer continues to turn around himself, he's kind of disconnecting from the movement vocabulary of salsa here. He's really turning around himself in more of a freestyle way, disconnecting his feet from one another. He's got this really significant turnout in both feet and this significant bend in both of his knees which is causing him to move slowly as he turns around himself rather than quickly and efficiently.

He would also benefit from some rhythmic clarity here. He seems to be holding the arm above his head and moving it down to alternate arms without any sort of real rhythmic embodiment or connection to the music.

Here the player has demonstrated a high degree of proficiency when he accidentally hit the ball a little bit too far behind him. Rather than panic or lunge, he manages to contort his body which takes some flexibility. And if you see here, he still has a locked ankle with the heel down and the toe up, which leads to a perfect recovery touch and then he gets back into his rhythm. Being able to quickly adjust your body and maintain flexibility but still maintain proper striking surfaces is a key to good juggling. Not only did he reach back but he maintained a heel toe relationship that was locked in order to quickly get control of the ball. The player also is showing a high degree of skill. Not only are they maintaining balance, but they're using different strike surfaces of both feet. Using both feet rather than just your dominant foot is another sign of proficiency in through juggling and will help you get better at the actual act. He's used the inside, the laces, and here consecutively he's using the outside of his foot. He still maintains proper striking form in the sense that his ankle is locked, his toe is up, which gives the ball a strong surface to go up on. You can see as he's juggling there's almost no spin on it and he maintains the exact same touch multiple times showing the consistency we're looking for when you're learning to juggle at a higher level. The player also demonstrates the ideal control for the ball, which is especially when using the feet below waist height or at times even below knee height. If he's not doing that, the ball still maintains relatively close between around his head height or around shin height where you'd want the ball in order to keep it up. At times players might mess with greater heights, but the ideal height for striking with the feet is below the waist, which he does with ease unless he's changing to a different surface, such as his thighs. Again, and it's extremely important to note in terms of his skill is that he's developed both foot. One footed juggling is a detriment in the long term and makes the actual act itself harder. Demonstrating or practicing proficiency in both feet will help you with balance and help you to be able to juggle longer for extended periods of time. He's worked on both touches, both surfaces, and you can see he's comfortable with both his left and right and multiple surfaces. Also, he's shown that he's comfortable using his thigh, chest, and even shoulder and head while juggling, which is important for the entire act in and of itself. You'll also notice with many of his touches, the ball has minimal spin or very little spin. At times, having some backspin or slight spin on the ball is okay, especially if you're doing it on purpose, but a sign of a pure touch is that the spin is minimal and it's not changing or moving the direction of the ball. Many early jugglers make the mistake of having too much backspin, which moves the ball into your body. Here, he's shown a high level of proficiency and control in the ball and not spinning it in any direction, which helps him maintain his control. Here the player is going through the act or the skill of juggling which is keeping the ball off the ground using all soccer allowed surfaces that excludes the arms and hands. The objective is to get touches while maintaining control of the ball without letting it hit the ground. The player is doing an excellent job of when they do change surfaces or hit the ball higher or farther out, quickly adjusting their body so they're back in balance and back to the same steady rhythm or relatively the same height use of the ball, which is head to shin. They're doing a good job of getting the same cadence as soon as they regain control. Here the player has adjusted his body very quickly. Rather than lean or stick out a leg or fall over, he moves with the ball so he maintains his own balance and regains control. If you ever lose control of a ball, regaining your own balance as quickly as you can and moving with the ball rather than lunging for it will help maintain control for better juggling. Another sign, as you saw from just now in the video, is that he maintains a consistent rhythm on the ball. You saw when he briefly lost some control, he quickly got hold of the ball and then got back into his rhythm, showing that he'd regained complete control. When working on juggling, a steady rhythm shows a superior level of touch and proficiency in terms of actually using striking surfaces. Immediately you can see from his balance that he's very in control of the ball. One of the key things to juggling is maintaining your own balance so that rather than you being off balance and constantly needed to readjust, you're in proper balance and can focus on how you're striking the ball. Here you can see he has good posture, a good relationship between his knee or his hip and his knee and his foot which allows him to focus again on how he's moving the striking surface of his foot rather than if the ball was all over the place or if he was off balance and leaning, chasing after the ball. Balance is one of the key indicators of you being able to successfully juggle versus you being able to constantly have to chase or dropping the ball.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here the player makes contact and doesn't really move forward, so we limit the control and accuracy we really have. And we can see the non-kicking foot is still pretty much rooted through the ground, so a lot of the control and the accuracy and the power is all generated by the right leg in the contact point with the ball, not really utilising the body for that additional element of the technique. Again, look at the non-kicking foot position where the toe is. Again, we're making contact with the ball in front of that line, so we're going to naturally be hitting the ball when our leg is moving forward. Hit the ball on an upward trajectory, it's going to limit the control of power. Also, obviously, this is our body leaning back and away, so that's going to affect, again, elements of the technique. So we want to make sure that we're making contact with the ball when it's in that number 10 shape where the non-kicking foot is, stroke the ball when the left leg is more vertical to the ground alongside the ball, bending this right knee, getting our hips forward, chest leaning slightly forward, and moving forward in the line of the pass. Again we can see obviously the direction of the ball coming in, playing the non-kicking foot again well behind the line of the ball so now we're reaching forward and also obviously the distance between the non-kicking foot and where the ball is travelling to leads us to now bringing this left leg pointing in, heel up, toe down, making contact close to the heel so that's going to affect the control and the power of the pass. And obviously we also have the body leaning back and away more towards the left side so based on the angle of the foot the body is not being fully utilised for the contact and for the next follow through action. I'm just looking at the contact point with the ball, so I'm making contact with the ball in front of the standing foot. Generally, we can see that by the position of the toe, the direction of the foot and where the ball is made contact with, so we can see it's well in front. We can see, again, the right leg, the leg turning inside, which is naturally going to lead to this foot position B, where the toe is pointing down, the heel is up. We want to be making contact with the lower leg, slightly straight and more vertical to the ground. Heel down, toe up, lock that ankle, really striking through the middle of the ball. Here again, it looks like we've made contact with the ball closer to the heel, stroke ankle area, which is going to lead to less control over the ball due to the nature of the curved surface and the harder surface. We can also see as the player is angling his foot to play the pass back towards the player, the body position, again, is still pointing slightly to the right. We want to try and make sure on contact and follow through that our body is aligned and moving through the line of the pass. And just looking at the contact point with the ball, we want to make contact ideally when the ball is alongside the standing foot. This just helps with our balance, our control, maximising the follow-through action. So we can see the ball is being made contact with in front of the standing foot. So now we're going to be reaching slightly in front of our body, making contact on the follow-through, which is going to impact the contact point on the ball and the follow-through action in general. The foot position, we see the toe down, heel up. So although we could potentially have a locked ankle position here, we're going to be making contact again closer to the heel, ankle, just because of the direction of the foot or potentially the lower half of the ball, which is going to impact the quality and control of the pass. So on heel down, toe slightly up, ankle locked, strike through the middle of the ball in the direction we want to go. And ideally we want to make contact when the lower leg is going straight down, not turning to the inside, because that's what's going to naturally move the foot into the position it's currently in. And we can also see as the player is striking the ball, the body is leaning backwards and away from the intended direction of the pass. We want to try to bend this right knee, get our hips forward, chest leaning slightly forward, so our body momentum moves through the strike. Just looking at how the player is receiving the ball. So as the ball is obviously travelling in, it's important to be on the balls of our feet, move our body behind the line of the ball so we can make good decisions on the technical selection and surface. So here you'll see the player preparing to strike the ball with the inside of the right foot as the ball is travelling towards his left. But we've already planted his left foot very flat to the ground, straight leg and the ball looks like it's travelling towards that foot. So if we're preparing to use the right foot, it's probably not the right technical selection for the most accurate and clean of passes. We can also see the body, very upright position. I do like the player really maintains strong visual contact on the ball all the way coming through. But we need to really be on the balls of our feet, moving our feet and timing both the selection of the pass that we're looking to make as well as the technical choices. Again, just looking at the follow-through action of the player, so very limited, quite short. It does go in the general direction that he wants the ball to go. We can see the foot opening up a little bit, knee opening up a little bit, hips and chest you can see facing out to the right side with the ball travelling through the centre. So we're not fully aligned. Elements of this come from just being very static and still through that left foot planted to the ground. So we want to be a little bit lighter on our feet, lock that ankle, strike through the line of the ball, keep our body aligned with the direction that the ball wants to travel. Again, just looking on contact with the player, with the outside of the right foot, the left foot throughout the ball, travelling into him, doesn't move, very upright static position, so I want to see a slight knee bend, and be more working on the balls of their feet as the ball's coming in. Again, we can see the player getting his foot in a decent position, toe down to the ground, bringing his knee forward over the ball, so that's going to help in terms of the contact point with the ball, but because we're not moving our left foot or stepping towards the ball, a lot of the work, the control of the player is now done with this action to move the foot towards the ball, rather than utilising the body and the balance to move the ball, and then move after. If we're moving towards the ball, we can get this knee closer to one line of the ball, and get our body moving forward through the line of the pass and into the next available space that we want to go. And again, we can see that again, partly through the body position, very upright, as we're reaching out to play the pass in front of the body, so it's not like an inside foot pass with the outside, we're naturally going to be stepping forwards and making contact, but then the follow-through action is going to be slightly different. The end player preparing to play a pass with the right foot so as the ball is traveling in we want to be on the balls of our feet moving in line with the ball. The player is starting to do better in terms of stepping towards the ball with the left foot and he's coming at a slight angle to the ball which is going to help him step into it and rotate his hips through the pass and then obviously we want to allow that ball to travel alongside the standing foot so we create this number 10 shape. Here you'll see again the toe is pointing really far out towards the right hand side towards the right post or outside and that generally controls the body position into the chest and the hips so the follow-through action is affected by that and the balance of the player can effectively be controlled by that. and it's looking at the contact point with the ball so look at the position of the non-kicking foot where we're making contact with the ball is well in front so now we're going to be reaching for the ball which is naturally going to lead to the player leaning back slightly so we don't have our full body momentum moving forwards and through the line of the pass. It's also going to impact the contact point with the ball so here it looks like the foot's in a slightly better position in terms of being more parallel to the ground but the contact with the ball again is much closer to the heel so it's a much much harder rounded surface than the inside curvature of the foot that we want to make contact with the middle of the ball to improve the quality, the consistency, the accuracy and the power of the pass so we want to make sure we're getting our body in a better position with that non-kicking foot stepping forward so we can make contact with the ball alongside the standing foot and get our body moving forwards through the pass itself. Again, very limited in follow-through action for the player. So the player looks like he keeps his foot relatively locked, but there's little to no follow-through, so we don't get any added control or accuracy, and we don't then use that body momentum to move through the ball and bring the body forward. So it's important that when we make contact, keep our foot in that locked position, follow through in the direction we want the ball to go. Can we then go from this bent knee to a straight leg to maximise the control and power we have. Bend this left knee, bring our hips forward, our chest forward in the line of the ball, not lean back from the line, which is going to risk making the ball travel up, but also affect the contact point of the ball due to our balance. Player preparing to play a pass with the inside of the right foot with the ball travelling towards him. Key things are move our feet, get our body behind the ball but as the ball is approaching can we step forward into the pass and time it so as the ball is travelling based on the speed and direction we make contact with the ball as the ball is alongside that standing foot. Here you'll see the player doesn't really move his feet, kind of waits for the ball so it's going to take longer for the ball to travel and in game situations potentially we lose seconds to make decisions and allow defenders to close us down so we want to step towards the ball and be light on our feet. Again we can see the body in a somewhat upright position and the player not really preparing any form of back lift and that again comes from not stepping towards the ball and giving himself the room to do so. Ideally we want to make contact with the ball when the ball is alongside the standing foot so we create this number 10 shape. Again you can see the angle of the non-kicking foot, the angle of the striking foot and the position of the ball so we're both coming across our body with the action and in front of our body so that's going to impact the players balance and ultimate control we can have. The kicking foot, the right foot here you can see the ankle not quite locked fully we want that toe to be pointing up to the ground we can see it pointing slightly down and away making sure we're trying to make contact with the inside curvature of the foot through the middle of the ball in the direction that we want to go. Again bringing this left knee forward, hips forward, chest leaning slightly forward so as we strike and make contact our body is moving through the same line. Again, just looking at the follow-through action, so the player still hasn't moved his left foot through the motion, so we're very planted and rigid through this left leg. We want to be light on our feet when playing the pass, receiving the ball. So if we're going to strike the ball with the outside of the right foot, ideally we would probably land on the right foot and we're bringing our body forward in the next direction that we want to travel, rather than being static through the left leg. You can see the position of the right foot, so all the ball's travelling forwards. If we're going to utilise the outside of the right foot, we want to see the action taking that right foot forward and through the line of the ball before he moves in his next direction, instead of his foot still pointing to the left as his body's facing the direction the ball is travelling. So it's going to limit follow-through action, it's going to limit our ability to move into space. And it's looking at the contact point for the player, so again player making contact in front of the standing foot, so we're going to end up making contact on the follow through motion as opposed to making contact with the balls alongside the foot, keeping the body in a better balanced position. Again we can see the toe pointing down to the ground, heel up, so we're naturally hitting more with the ankle stroke heel, which is going to have less control for the player, so we want to strike through the middle of the ball with the inside curvature of the foot with the heel down, toe up, right through the middle of the ball in the direction that we want to go. You can also see by hitting the ball in front of the body makes it harder for us to get our hips and our chest forward over the ball because we are reaching with the left leg, so we want to try and get our hips forward, our chest leaning forward by getting the non-kicking foot in the right position and maybe bending this right knee more on contact so we're stepping forward into the pass. So we're going to have the follow through action, so it's important that we keep our foot in a locked position all the way through the contact and into the follow through, so stay strong, stay with a firm contact with the middle of the ball. So the follow through action is relatively limited, so to generate more control and power the more we can strike through and then fix this right leg into more of a straight leg on the follow through rather than maintain this knee bent, it's going to help us get through the ball. I'd also like to see a little bit of flexibility in the left knee bringing the body forward, so bend that left knee get the hips forward, chest leaning more in the direction that he wants the ball to go to help utilise his body momentum to move forward. Body's in a decent position in terms of the hips and the body facing the way that the pass is being played as well as the angle of the foot facing that way which is going to help us control the direction of the pass. So you can see a slightly better example for the players with the balls travelling in, player moves his feet slightly, moves across, then he's stepping towards the ball and he's stepping towards the ball from a slight angle which is going to help with the rotation of the hips. But that forward step with the right foot is going to allow the player a better chance of moving his body through the line of the pass. Can we get our toe pointing generally in the direction we want the ball to go? Obviously here the toe pointing more towards the post, the right post and outside the line of the goal. So now we're going to have to adjust the contact point with the ball to get the ball travelling to where we intend it to go. So that non-kicking foot is important in terms of the body position, the follow-through action that we can take and making sure that we're preparing our left leg, getting our foot in the right position and timing it so we allow this ball now to travel alongside the standing foot and make contact when it's alongside the right foot. Again, it's looking at the preparation for the player, so ball travelling towards. I'd like to see players stepping in towards the ball and then obviously timing it so on contact from the back lift, the player then makes contact with the ball when the ball is alongside the standing foot. Here the player's right foot as he's preparing to pass with the left. She's very flat footed, very stuck to the ground, very straight leg, so the player's not going to be able to adjust or adapt when I see him on the balls of his feet, slight knee bend and really starting to step towards the ball so he can time the pass with the left foot. Again, body position very upright, so we're going to be in a very rigid and static position when striking the ball. Just looking at contact point with the ball, so we see during the ball approaching the player, the left foot doesn't move and adjust, he's not on the balls of his feet, very straight, rigid leg which is going to impact the cushion and the control that the player can have in his contact. We can see the player utilising the outside of the right foot to play the pass back. So here it's good that the player's toe is starting to point down towards the ground so we can strike through the laces through the middle of the ball. Obviously from this angle we can see the toe pointing slightly to the left. A little bit of this is down to the body position being very upright and straight. So as that ball's coming in, if we're going to play with the outside, can we turn our body slightly to the left so we can really strike through the line of the pass with the laces in the direction that we want the ball to go. The players utilise the left foot, so as we see the ball being played in, we'll see a small step towards the ball, but again we can see the player relatively flat-footed and high and static as he's receiving the ball, so waiting for the ball to come to him, which is okay, but in terms of this activity I'd prefer to see the player stepping forwards towards the ball to maximise the body's ability to get forward and attack the ball and move with the ball, so we're making sure we're getting that non-kicking foot in a position where it's pointing in the general direction we want to go, and allowing that ball to travel alongside it so that we can make clean contact. Again, just looking at the contact, so contact point again where the non-kicking foot is and pointing. You can see the line of the pass and then the angle of the right foot is well in front of the standing foot, so we're going to end up again reaching for the ball, making contact on the follow-through action. So it's not going to be as clean as we would ideally want. Foot looks in a slightly better position in terms of heel down, ankle locked, toe up. With having that toe up, we generally should lock that ankle. We need to keep that contact through the ball. Again, hard to see the ball making contact with the inside curvature of the foot still closer to the heel, which is going to affect the clarity of the pass. The heel is a harder, more rounded surface, so the ball can go off on a varying tangent. And again, we can see the angle of the foot looks like we're looking to play back obviously towards the player, to the left side of the goal, the non-kicking foot, the hips, the body, everything's pointing to the right. So if we're coming across our body, it's going to have an impact on our balance and our follow-through motion. So again the follow through action, so obviously the player brings his right foot inside, makes contact with the ball and then follows through in a circular motion to the outside. But we can see the left foot still not moving as the player makes the pass. So all the control and accuracy and power is generally coming from the right leg and the right foot. We want to be striking the ball with the foot and then either following through in the line of the ball or moving quickly into the next space that we want to receive the ball. So in terms of the technical choice as well as the technical actions, some different elements that we can improve. Definitely improving the body position, we can see the body is in a very upright position, being rooted through this left leg as he's playing the pass. So it limits the control, accuracy and power we can generate. Once again, the player preparing to receive the ball. So as the ball is starting to travel in, we want to adjust our feet, be on the balls of our feet, move behind the line of the ball. Here, the player again, very rooted to the ground, very flat-footed, want to be on the balls of our feet, feet shoulder width apart and looking ready to receive and adjust. Player here in a very upright position, just waiting for the ball to come in. But ideally, we want to make sure that as the ball's coming in, we provide the space to come into the area alongside the standing foot as much as we can if we're going to play a pass with the inside of our foot. So then just looking at the contact point with the ball, we can see the position of the toe, both in the direction that it's facing and then obviously the angle and where we're making contact with the ball and the angle of the foot. It's going to make it very difficult for us to strike cleanly through the ball and maintain our balance. So when we're looking to make contact with the ball, we want to make contact when it's along, especially with the inside of the foot, contact alongside the standing foot, but that standing foot needs to be generally pointing in the direction we want to go so we can get our body position in a better position so we're not now bringing this right knee inside, which is naturally going to bring the foot into this position with the toe down, heel up. It's going to make it difficult to strike through the middle of the ball because we generally will hit the ball closer to the heel with our toe down or the bottom half of the ball. So the foot is coming much closer to the line of the non-kicking foot, which makes it more difficult to strike through the ball cleanly with the right lower leg coming more vertically down to the ground. The player again looking to receive the ball from a rolling position so as the ball is coming in the player is pretty static and standing in one spot so we want to see the player on the balls of their feet, maybe a slight knee bend, moving those feet behind the line of the ball coming in so then it can be better balanced and controlled for whatever technical choice the player makes whether playing the pass with the inside or with the outside of the foot. Follow through is very important, see the foot changes shape and wobbles through the contact so if the foot stays in a locked position it shouldn't really move through the contact and all the way through the line of the ball. Ideally we want to keep this leg as it goes from this bend position on the follow through to a straight leg to maximise the control and power and also again the left foot doesn't really move through the action so as we're striking through with the right we want to be a little bit more lighter on the feet, keeping the hips forward, chest forward, not leaning back as we're moving into a pass moving forwards. Once again, just looking at the player's preparation, ball travelling in towards, player does take a step towards the line of the ball which is important, but still allowing that ball obviously to travel in alongside the standing foot. Where we plant the non-kicking foot is important, so it's pointing here towards the right post and slightly outside, that controls the body position, the follow through action helps with our balance and control. So here we can see the player is stepping towards, but again we want to be a little bit more agile and ready to receive the ball. So step in, can we bend that knee, prepare this left leg, there's no real back lift which is okay, but we can see the player coming from a very static position, upright body position, we want to step in and make sure that we're in a fully balanced position as we're making contact with the ball. So again, preparing to play the pass with the inside of the right foot. So as the ball's travelling in, we want to be on the balls of our feet, move our body in position behind the line of the ball, step towards the ball with the left foot. If we're going to prepare to play with the right, so the player does this well, we want to make sure that our non-kicking foot is generally pointing in the direction that we want to play the pass, because that helps control our follow through and our body position as well as our balance, and being in a position where we can allow the ball to travel alongside the standing foot to strike through. We can see as the player's preparing, very upright position, very static, so that's going to limit the momentum that the player can generate through the pass. Right preparance player pass with the left foot, so obviously the ball is travelling in and player is starting to move his feet across, does take a step towards the ball with the right foot as he plants it which is fine because we want to allow that ball, we want to step towards the ball but allow that ball to travel alongside the standing foot. Again the non-kicking foot we ultimately want to be pointing towards the direction that we want the ball to travel or how we're looking to receive the ball, this helps control the follow through of the body position so we can see the body position is pointing out towards that left hand side so and then depending on the outcome of the player that can affect the technical action of the contact with the ball. Again the follow through is very important, you can see the foot changes its position and angle both in terms of the direction it's facing and the position of the foot. So if we don't have that locked ankle and firm contact all the way through the ball it's going to affect the quality of the pass. You can also see the follow through is still in that bent knee position rather than moving through with a straight leg. So again it limits the control and the power of the pass and the motion of the follow through is limited as well so we lose elements of control. You can also see the direction of the ball and the final body position at the end of that follow through, body still facing to the right, legs coming across the body to the left and the left foot is still planted very much through the ground with a straight leg. So we don't have our body momentum moving through the ball, we don't have a full amount of balance so the pass is going to be affected. The follow through action, again we want to keep our foot in a locked, firm position all the way through the strike. So the foot we want it to be angled in the way we want to go but there was a little bit of a wobble with the foot in the follow through so it shows the ankle is not quite locked so we're not going to get as firm enough contact with the ball. We can also see that the follow through action again very limited as it's coming through the initial line of the ball but then our body is leaning back and away, our hips and our chest are facing one way as the ball is travelling the other and the body is still leaning in the direction away from the ball. Not utilising the arms for additional balance and momentum so we need to be stepping towards the ball so we can increase and improve elements of our technique and body position. Again, just looking at the contact with the ball, we can see the ball being made contact slightly in front of the line of the standing foot. Again, just leads to us making contact on an upwards movement within the follow through. Also, it makes it more difficult to get our body forwards and through the line of the pass. So, we want to make contact with the ball when it's alongside the standing foot. Can we get our heel down, toe slightly up so we can make contact through the middle of the ball, the inside curvature of the foot. Here again, it's hard to see from here, but it looks like it's making more contact closer to the heel, stroke, ankle, which is going to have an impact on the control and accuracy of the pass that we can make. And trying again, making sure that we're trying to bend this right knee forward, get our hips in line with the ball when we can, get our chest leaning forwards towards the direction we want to play the pass. Again, all made difficult when the non-kicking foot doesn't get alongside the ball on contact because we're naturally going to be reaching for the ball with the left foot. So again, just talking about the preparation for the player. So it's important that we are alert, ready to adjust and adapt on receiving the ball, whether we're playing a pass first time or receiving. So we want a player to be on the balls of their feet, maybe the feet shoulder width apart, slight bend in the knees so we're ready to adjust, get our body behind the line of the ball. So although here you can see the ball's traveling in and the player is generally in a line behind the ball, you can see how close his feet are together. So he's not necessarily ready to receive the ball fluently, not kicking foot. In this case, he's gonna be playing the ball with the right so his left foot is very planted to the ground, straight leg, high body position. So it's gonna limit our options as we're receiving the ball. Looking at the player again, as the ball is approaching the player, coming towards him, again important for our footwork, body position to get behind the line of the ball. We can see as the ball is travelling on a slight angle, the right foot is coming in planted, again we want to try and step towards a rolling ball as much as we can, allows us to get our body moving towards and then through the ball, maintain our balance and momentum going forwards and obviously we want to try and plant our foot in a way that it's pointing in the direction we want to go to help with our body position and control. Once again we can see a player making contact with the ball well in front of the standing foot. So again that just means that now we're making contact with the ball on the follow through. So even if we strike through the middle of the ball, the follow through action is going to be going up and through the middle to the top of the ball. So it's going to affect a lot of elements of quality and control. By limiting the follow through action it's also going to limit the power that we can generally create. Making sure we keep the ankle locked, heel down, toe up so the foot here is in a slightly better position, a little bit more parallel to the ground. So we can get that toe locked up so we're really striking through the middle of the ball, maximising the control and accuracy. And then also looking at the non-kicking foot, so where that's pointing is generally going to be controlling the body position and we want everything to be aligned. So on contact can we get the inside of the foot, can we get the hips, the body, the non-kicking foot all pointing towards the same direction to maximise the control of the passing action. And follow through action for me very important in any kind of pass or ball striking. We want to keep the ankle locked and our foot in a steady position all the way through the contact. So from the back lift to the contact to now the follow through. Can we keep that foot locked in the same position? Here you can see the follow through very limited and now the angle of the foot is pointing away. So the more we can strike through the line of the ball and in that direction, the more control and power we're going to generate. We can also see how limited the follow through action is. So I'm going to go through a straight leg all the way through the ball. That will help bring our body forward and again control the ball better, more power and accuracy. If we can get a slight knee bend in this right leg to bring the hips and the chest moving forward rather than leaning back, that's going to again help with our balance and control. Then just looking at the follow-through action for the player. For me it's important the follow-through keeps our foot in a locked position, move the foot through with the foot in that locked position through the line of the pass. So here we can see the angle of the foot is changing as we move through. So we have them come all the way through the line of the ball, can we get a straight leg in that follow-through, but keep our body facing the direction we want the pass to go. So here you can see the non-kicking foot pointing to the left towards the right post and generally that helps control where the hips and the body position is facing. So now we're striking through the ball across our body a little bit, which is going to limit our ability to have full control and balance. You can just see the follow through action, again very limited for the player, still in this bent knee shape. So we want to keep the ankle locked all the way through the line of the pass. The foot does wobble again on contact with the heel. So we want to try and keep that foot angled and locked all the way through the line of the pass with a straight leg. Again bending this right knee, it's hard to get the hips and the body forward when we're making contact with the ball in front of the standing foot. So that's where that preparation is important, stepping into the line of the pass and moving forwards with it. So it's looking at the preparation from the player, so the ball travelling towards the player. Important that we move our feet, get our body behind the line of the ball first and foremost. Player here not necessarily working on the balls of his feet, we can see a very static position. So although the body's behind the ball we see a very flat foot, straight leg, so I'd see the player on the balls of their feet, slight knee bend, slight bounce in terms of anticipating the ball coming in, it will help with the action of the pass itself. Making sure that we're keeping our eyes on the ball, allowing the ball to travel into the position between the standing foot and the spacing between the body, create that number 10 shape to make contact. So ideally we'd be stepping towards the ball as the ball's coming in, timing it so as we make contact with the ball, the ball is alongside the standing foot. Again looking at the contact point with the ball, making contact with the ball well in front of the standing foot means that we're going to be reaching for the ball slightly and making contact on our way up through the ball which is going to impact the quality, consistency, control and power on the shot. You can see the toe is pointing down to the ground so we're going to hit the ball again closer to the heel, stroke ankle or the lower half of the ball. We want to try and get this heel down, toe up, lock our ankle, strike through the middle of the ball in the direction we want the ball to go. Ideally we would want the non-kicking foot to be planted so it's pointing the direction we want to go. That's going to help us control our body position, body shape and play in the pass because we want our hips and our chest aligned with the follow through in the direction we want to play the pass. If the non-kicking foot is pointing slightly to the left that's going to affect the follow through motion because now we're going to be rotating around and it's going to affect the body position of the player. Again, just looking at the immediate follow-through action for the player, which is important in the pass or the strike. We can see as the player makes contact, the foot changes his position a few times, shows that the ankle may be not fully locked as we go through. We also want to try and keep this foot positioned facing the direction we want the ball to go. It's going to show us that we have a firm locked ankle contact on the ball and come through with a straighter leg to maximise the power and control. Obviously when the knee is bent, the ankle is not loose, the contact is probably not going to be as firm. And again, we can see the body position as the ball is travelling forwards, body is still leaning backwards and away, players arms not really being utilised for any additional balance and the feet close together. So, in terms of what the player can do next is going to be limited. Again, just a follow through action, we can see the foot changes positions throughout both in angle as well as the foot position itself. So it shows we maybe don't have a firm locked ankle for a firm contact through the ball. The follow through action is again very limited, rooted through this right leg. So he's not bringing his full leg through the ball, keeping his foot in that locked position through the direction he wants to go. So better in terms of his body position, you see his chest and his hips are facing the line of the pass in line with the non-kicking foot, but the body is still leaning back and away from that direction of the pass where we want to be moving forward, bending this right knee, going our hips slightly further forward, chest leaning slightly further forward to get our body momentum moving through the pass. And just looking at the contact with the ball, we can see again the player not moving his feet planted to the ground through his standing foot. So now if he's going to use the outside of his right foot, it's actually okay for his body to turn this way as he strikes through the ball. But then as we're striking the ball, we want to have our body momentum moving forwards into the next space or through the line of the pass that we're going to play. Because the left foot doesn't move, we end up reaching for the ball, the distance between the non-kicking foot and the right foot that's passing the ball becomes greater. So then we lose elements of balance and we can't maximise the control and accuracy and power on the pass itself. You can also see from reaching, it's very difficult to get this toe down. So we end up making contact with the foot a little flat and more parallel to the ground. And that's going to affect our quality of our pass as well as our quality of movement after making contact. And ideally, if we're going to bend this left knee, we're bringing our hips and our body forwards towards the ball so then we can move fluently in the next action. Follow through action for the player is a little limited, very short action to follow through. We can see the foot changing position quite quickly so we want to try and keep this foot in a locked position, ankle locked, following through in the direction we want to go. Ideally with the foot still facing that way, straight leg, bending this right knee forward, hips, chest leaning forward towards the direction that we want to go, not leaning back and away. Looking at the contact point for the pass, so again the player stays very static through the right foot, he's not stepping towards it. We can see the player reaching now with the left foot, so the distance between the non-kicking foot and the foot striking the ball with the left foot is increasing. So we're leaning forward and reaching for the ball so we don't have the full maximum effect of the contact and the follow through motion. Foot, again we can see the toe pointing slightly down to the ground, a little bit more parallel than some prior. That comes from reaching for the ball, so we want to try and get this toe slightly up, heel down, make sure that we're making contact with the inside curvature of the foot, not the heel with the middle of the ball because we lose control due to the rounded and hard nature of the surface. And make sure then we are connecting with the ball, going straight through the ball. Again you can see the body position is reaching out, back is leaning back and quite straight up and again the arms not really being utilised for additional balance, momentum or control. Again we can see player looking to utilise the inside of the right foot. We see the foot in a slightly better position with the toe up a little bit more. The leg in a better position in terms of the lower leg vertically down, not tucked in. Although here we can see the ball making contact closer to the heel. We want to make contact through the inside curvature of the foot through the middle of the ball for the maximum control and accuracy when the ball hits the heel. The ball can go off in different directions because it's a rounded surface and a harder surface so we need to really focus on getting the inside of the foot through the ball in the direction we want to play it. We can see again the non-kicking foot on contact is pointing way out to the right and is behind the line of the ball. So now we end up reaching for the ball, potentially coming across our body or leaning as we make contact. We can see that from the body position leaning back and away. We'd like this left knee to be bending as he's making contact, bringing the hips forward, chest slightly leaning forward, head in a position over the ball so we can get our body momentum moving through the line of the pass. The end player not really maximising the follow through, foot looks like it's in a more locked position throughout but we only fractionally go through the line of the ball. So the less contact and the less follow through, the less power we can generate, the less control we ultimately have. We can also see the player's body still slightly behind the line of the standing leg and way behind the line of the ball where we make impacts so by leaning back and away we're not maximising our body momentum to move through the pass. Again, the follow through, very important for control and power. We see the foot changing shape slightly, so it's not fully locked as we go through or the contact is off. So it's important we get this foot following through, angled in the same direction we want the pass. Can we go from that bent knee position, making contact to a straight leg through the ball, so the player stays very structured in that shape, very shallow follow through, very static with the non-kicking leg. So we want to try and bring our hips forward, body slightly forward in the line of the pass, keep everything aligned so obviously the non-kicking foot pointing to the right. That's where the body is now lined up to, but the ball is travelling towards the left based on the body position. So can we strike through the ball and get our body moving through the line of the shot. Again, it's looking at the preparation, so the ball's traveling towards the player. Player does take a slight step towards the ball, so it's important when we're stepping forward it's going to be timed in a way that we can step forward and make contact with the ball as the ball travels to a position alongside the standing foot. So that timing and patience is important. Can we get the toe pointing in the general direction? We want the ball to go next. That's going to help with the follow-through action, the body position, the balance of the player, and then obviously trying to be in a ready position. So here a little upright and static, so that we're stepping forward, be on the balls of our feet and be ready to strike through that ball as it comes in. So we're just looking at the preparation for the player, so we're looking at the direction of the ball coming in. We want the player to be on the balls of their feet, moving behind the line of the ball, ideally if we're looking to make a pass. We can see the left foot again, very planted and rooted to the ground as the ball's coming in. So unless we're moving our feet it's going to limit the choices, the balance, the control that we have over the ball. So again, player preparance, player pass being played towards him. Player does take a step towards the ball, which I like, from a slight angle, which is going to help with the body position and the hips moving through the ball. Again you can see the non-kicking foot as it lands is pointing more towards the right. The non-kicking foot and the way it's pointing is helpful in terms of the follow-through action and the body position of the player. But also helping with the timing as we step forward, improving the back lift and the contact point with the ball. So we want to make sure that we're stepping towards the ball so we can bring this right leg towards the ball so it makes contact as it's alongside the standing foot. Again I like the player maintains strong visual focus on the ball all the way through the action from the ball coming in to the contact and the follow-through. That's going to help him in certain elements of the technical actions. Just looking at the contact with the ball, so the ball is being played in front of the standing leg which is going to mean we're reaching for the ball slightly, making contact with the ball on that follow through action, so that's going to limit the power and control we generate from the follow through. We can also look at the foot position with the heel up, toe down. Ideally we want the heel down, toe slightly up, lock the ankle so we can strike through the middle of the ball. When the foot's in this position, we generally hit the ball closer to the heel, stroke ankle, which is a harder, more rounded service so we lose elements of control. So we want to strike through the middle of the ball with the inside curvature of the foot and lock that ankle, heel down, toe up, show us we get that. We can also see the leg position starting to turn inside, which could be a result of the proximity from the ball to the standing foot and the player obviously naturally there and it's been harder to get the toe pointed up with the leg turning in so we want to try and get this lower leg in a straighter position, more vertical, to help us put the foot in the right position, strike through the ball freely. So again we can see the player preparing to receive a ball rolling towards him. The player does a little bit better here in terms of stepping forward with the left foot as he prepares to strike with the right foot but we can see the direction of the left foot is really pointing out to the right hand side so we want to try and get that toe pointing in the general direction we want to go because that's going to help control our body position and our follow-through action as we make contact and follow through the ball and by stepping towards the ball we want to make sure that we're in a position where we allow that ball to roll alongside the standing foot and we make contact when that ball is level and with the toe so the timing of the of the action is important", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They're not doing the foundational step. They're not even stepping on the beat. You know, this type of dance really is all about the music, embodying the music, and staying on the beat, and they've lost that basic foundation. So here again he tried to get her to join him and she completely ignored him and just turned around and kept dancing away from him. So it's important if he's the leader to let him be the leader and to say yes to his contact because that's an agreed upon, agreed upon, that's what's agreed upon when you decide to do a partner dancing such as this. I think another big kind of conceptual issue that I'm having with their dancing is that they're not on the beat, but I don't think they even notice that. And that's a big red flag. That means that they are not very skilled dancers yet, and they're trying to do all these complex choreography. They're just not ready for it. They should be recognizing right away when they get off the beat and doing their very, very darndest to get back on it before trying any other fancy turns and things like that. So it's just not performance ready. Again, everything I've said before, they both don't have enough control. He's too tightly held in and she's too flailing. You know, she's trying to do some various kicks and he's trying to sort of imitate her. So I think now they're back to her sort of back leading him even though they're not physically in contact and it's not working. Good, so now they are doing a basic foundational step. So they're doing some sort of swing, step one, slow, slow, quick, quick, slow, something like that. And they're both doing it. They're both on the opposite foot of each other, which is great. Unfortunately, they're both dancing on flat feet. That's not a good idea. Dancing on the balls of the feet is the best way to dance, especially in partner dancing, so that you have freedom of movement, so that you can move efficiently and quickly. Okay, so here he's the leader and so what he's done here in this moment is offered his hand to her. I think he probably should have waited until she was done turning because she doesn't, I don't think she sees that he's doing that. Actually I can tell she can't because she's not looking at his hand here. So I would just recommend that he waits so that she can actually see when he offers the hand because otherwise we as viewers were just seeing him hold his hand out and she's not taking it. The way that she's moving her arms here is another clear indication of a lack of technique and a lack of experience. This sort of weak elbow shape with this up turned wrist is really common in inexperienced dancers. For some reason people think that that's what dancers are doing when they're moving their arms and so when they try to imitate it that's how it comes across. So very obvious to me that she doesn't have a lot of dance experience. Also her head again lack of control, lack of coordination. She's got her head all tilted off to the side. That's not adding anything to the shape that she's doing. In fact it's just making it look even more flailing and less controlled. Okay, he's lost the basic foundational step now. Not good. Again, they're not going to be coordinated with each other. And they aren't actually. They're already not coordinated because you can see she has her weight on this foot and a sort of a lunge backwards here. If they were mirroring each other, he would have this foot forward in that lunge and the second foot behind, but he's doing the opposite of that. He's sort of got his weight on both feet, but with this leg back. So they've lost each other and that's because he did not continue with the basic foundational step. So she's collapsed inward towards him and that's because neither of them are doing any sort of basic foundational step. They kind of haven't agreed, in their minds at least, what they're doing. I don't even know what style of dance they're doing here because they are not doing a basic foundational step. And so that's going to make them not well coordinated with each other. And so things like this will happen. They'll crash into each other at times because they aren't communicating and they're not doing the same step as each other. That's just the bottom line. Okay, here he offers his hand and she's just simply refuses it. She just sort of brushes him off so that she can do her own thing. That's not okay. She's not the leader. And I don't care what, what, who, if she becomes, if she wants to be the leader, then she should be the leader. Back leading like this is not, it's not good because it's confusing to both of them. It also puts him in this position of having to do a bunch of solos, improvisation solos that he clearly does not want to do. If she wants to do a little solo, then she should just do a solo for three minutes by herself without involving him. It's really not quite fair to him. And it's also confusing and makes them, it makes them be even more disconnected and more discoordinated when they're, when they are dancing together. Okay, so the music has gone into this really cool, like, scatting moment, and the scatting singer is doing some really complex, quick staccato rhythms, and they've completely lost the beat again. They're not even dancing on the tempo, and so especially is highlighted and emphasized in this moment because the music has this really beautiful staccato quality to it that they aren't mimicking whatsoever. Also, they made some kind of mistake here. Basically, she's not following him very well, and so what he's trying to get her to do, they're not accomplishing, but then she sort of laughs about it, and she kind of collapsed downwards, and so she's just highlighting the mistake that they made. It's important to hide mistakes as much as possible. She's back leading again. She decided, okay, I want to do a dip now. And she just went into a dip. Problem with that is that's he's number one, he's the leader. They should do a dip when he's ready for a dip because it would actually be more successful. This is not a successful dip because his energy is still traveling this direction and she's stopped. She's not traveling any direction and then arced backwards. And so he can't really support her very well in this dip. And the energy is all off as well. I shouldn't say energy, but the trajectory, the momentum is all off. Again, they're not coordinated. And so the dip is not as successful as it could be if he were involved in the dip and had initiated it. It's successful for her in a little way because she's so flexible. She can really arch her back very far back. So she's able to get a strong arc there, but the whole pattern and the quality of it is not working. If she weren't that flexible, this wouldn't work. This would be even less successful. This is an awkward turn and I think it's because she doesn't have a strong frame with her shoulder and so as he's Suggesting that they turn it's her arm that moves first rather than her whole body moving with her I mean, it's really nice that she's doing these really full movements with her arms, but the problem a couple problems One is she's super hyper extended through this elbow She needs to work on strengthening through her biceps so that that doesn't happen mostly for her own health long term That's not good to keep doing that hyper extension, but also because it makes it so that instead of a line We have a curve here. It doesn't match this side and then she's as she's bringing this arm up and around these arms up and around It's also not symmetrical. It's not consistent. It's not well controlled So again a very flailing quality to her dancing and once again, he's really not done much with his arms or his legs here He's just kind of a same kind of pattern that I mentioned before Okay, so they're starting this improvisation section at the beginning of their choreography, and it's not successful for multiple reasons. Let's talk about the leader first. I know he's the leader, by the way, because I've watched the rest of the choreography and he's meant to be the leader. So he's clearly very uncomfortable. He clearly doesn't have a lot of experience sort of just jamming and improvising because he's very, very stiff with his arms. He basically, with the arms, he kind of holds this straight arm and just kind of moves this arm this way and back, and then this one back and forth like this. He's also very stiff with these very straight knees and stepping on the balls of his, or on the flat feet, and he's kind of arched forward. His chest is a little bit dumped forward. So it's not very interesting to watch. He looks self-conscious and it makes the viewer, it makes me feel self-conscious for him. Which, as an audience member, that's really common. Whatever the dancer is exuding, the audience can feel. One of the worst things you can do is make the audience feel embarrassed for you or self-conscious for you. So what I'd recommend for him is that he try to exaggerate a little bit more. Actually, no. What I would recommend for both of them, they need to get into technique class and they need to practice and get a better, stronger vocabulary before trying to improvise. Dancing is one of the most difficult things that a dancer can do successfully because it can come across as super, super pedestrian, like it is coming across for them, because they don't have enough vocabulary and they don't have enough experience to know how to initiate movement appropriately. And so it looks very, very... His dancing looks very, very stiff and awkward and her dancing looks very, very flailing. They kind of are having these opposite effects because she's doing a little too much and he's not doing enough. For her, her main issue is that she's not moving from her core. You can see that because her pelvis is tilted forward. You can see that in the shape of her body right here. Her pelvis is also lagging behind. So she's not engaged through her core and so she's moving, rather than moving from her core, she's moving from her proximal limbs, especially from her shoulders. So there's this really kind of, like I said, like a flailing quality to what she's doing here and you can see that in this moment, the way her arms are shaped here. She's also not super well coordinated between the arms and legs. Another thing is that because her core is not engaged and her pelvis is tilted forward, she often loses balance and isn't doing that in this moment, but I'll point out when I notice her. I appreciate here that, you know, as there's this loud saxophone sort of sound, she's doing this head roll, but it's not precise enough, it's not controlled enough, so again, it has this sort of flailing quality, it looks very weak. Again, very flailing quality to her dancing. I appreciate that she lets herself, her body go and lets her body move and lets herself get a little bit off balance, but the problem is that she doesn't have adequate control and she doesn't initiate her movement from her core and so it really just looks super super flailing but not like she's intentionally flailing, so it really is just very quite weak. Good, so once she sees it and she's finished her turn, she takes the offering of his hand, which is excellent. They are both, they both happen to end, I don't know if they happen to have planned it, but they happen to end on the correct foot, so they're mirroring each other here, which is great. Good, so here they are dancing on the beat. They're doing this sort of side to side swinging step and they're stepping on the beat, which is excellent. They're also kind of pushing through their hips as they go, especially the followers, she's doing a great job with that. So it gives the step a bit more interest than just a plain side to side. Okay, so here she's done this really big sort of turning leaping thing across the floor. Again, really poor control of her body. It's very flailing, it's not precise. Her pattern pathway across the floor is sort of like that. She's also losing her balance here and that's because she doesn't have adequate core strength and doesn't know how to move from her core or is not moving from her core and so her pelvis is throwing her off balance here. She's kind of falling. Again, a flailing quality to what she's doing. I kind of feel bad for him because she's obviously leading and he's obviously very uncomfortable. She's like cruising across the floor here and he's kind of chasing her but again he doesn't really have adequate control of his body either and so he can't really come up with anything interesting to do. He's just very, very stiff through the arms and also through the legs. Again, very flailing quality to her dancing. She's not super well coordinated. You can see she's kind of losing her balance here. I really appreciate that she has a lot of exuberance and it seems like she really enjoys dancing, which is great. And I don't want her to stop dancing. I actually want her to dance more. I want her to go to more classes. I want her to work on that coordination and that strength. Maybe take some ballet classes that would help with that coordination and that strength that she's really lacking because it's a successful performer combines that love and that joy with strong technique so that as you marry those two things together, it's very pleasing for the viewer. She's missing the technique part of it. So I want her to take that joy and I want her to add the technique and I want her to bring them together. And I want to commend her for having that joy and that exuberance. And I don't want her to not have that. I just want her to again, combine that with more strength and control. What it is is that there's not precision. Neither of them are moving with precision. And it's because again, they don't have enough experience to know where their body is in space at all times, all parts of their body and to place the various parts of their body where they want it to go. So it looks very sloppy and imprecise and very obvious. They don't have very much technique experience, are not ready for improvisation. So I would recommend again, more technique class. I'd recommend don't improvise yet. Have somebody choreograph this section for them and then rehearse the choreography.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I would encourage them to think about the direction they need to go each single time they turn, so to have more clarity. Here I would encourage the dancer to really think about being really clean and sharp with their arms to increase the overall precision of the dance. I think this dancer, since this is advanced salsa, can really think about when to move more staccato versus when to have more flow in their movement. Here, this movement right here is a perfect example of if they were grounded, they would be able to kind of do these step, step, step, step, step, step, step really quickly. So dropping that weight and really dropping that pelvis and dropping that weight and bending those legs would allow them to move really quickly on the balls of their feet. I would encourage a dancer to really think about moving from staccato to legato movements and thinking about movement quality because the arm should really flow and you should really point really longingly across the space. So understanding that legato movement before it moves into these really quick, fast steps. This dancer did a really great job of transitioning to the floor and getting back up by understanding where to shift their weight. So kudos to them. This is still a salsa, so I would encourage the dancer to really think about hip articulation. I think the dancer really needs to think about grounding and really working from opening their feet more when they dance so they have a stability throughout to move really quickly.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Think of it as a clamp. Now the climber must remain to keep the elbow down to create friction when sustaining the grip. Now as the climber is working on moving quickly before getting to the left hand hold, climber had placed his left foot and kept the right leg extended and pressed down and pressed with the toe against the wall to generate power for his stance as well as bringing his hips close to the wall. Here the climber has been able to release the right foot out of place after placing pressure on the left foot. As we can see, he needs to make sure that he brings his center of gravity underneath the hold that's been held above him. This in order to then, after making the right foot placement, the climber can release the left hand to the next handhold. The climber has a two-hand hold start. The top grip, the climber must create pressure by leaning on the hold and pressing it towards him as he is at the same time engaging the left-hand grip on an undercling, meaning that there is a jug that is positive and seems to be placed upside down, where the climber must slide the fingers underneath the hold. In order to sustain this hold, the climber must create a pulling position towards him the way that the climber is compressing the move when making the foot placement. This time the climber has placed the right foot on a foot chip and once the climber gets to bring the left foot out of the mat, then the climb will start. As the climber went up for the reach, you can see he was able to make the hand placement, but wasn't able to apply friction, reason why the right hand has slipped out of place. This was also due to the leg that was out on the flag. He then was struggling in making a foot placement and had send it behind him, driving the force of gravity down, not helpful for the climbers making the right hand placement up to the block. The climber has sent the left hand to come into place to match the right hand hold. This one, it's called a jug. And so since this one has a big lip, the climber is able to wrap his hands around it to sustain the grip. However, the climber has pulled into the hole engaging more pressure onto the grips and the climber has lost applying pressure on the left foot when making the placement of the left hand. This can compromise the climber from over gripping and tiring the upper body just the beginning of the climb. So in order for the climber to get back into the wall, you would need to engage his core to make a foot placement down below. You can see the climber bringing his left foot placement to place the toe above the hand hold grip. This one being an undercling. In this instance the climber right now will have to continue to create pressure by pulling on the hold while pressing down the toe against the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So they're really swinging hips right to left to right with the goal of releasing at the apex of this jump so that they can catch the hold. And again, it's just kind of reward climbing. The dino that they do at the end is straightforward, and because the climber is tall enough, this is not a very difficult move. Great use of bringing the second hand up immediately to get over the top of the hold.

He does this by sending the left leg that was extended to be pointed on the opposite direction and this one so it can be a back flag. The climber then is able to bring his weight, center of gravity, close to the wall when making the reach. Here, the climber is leaning over to the right with the arms extended and also extending the right leg. This so that the climber is ready to do a committed pull where he then immediately would have to step up over the only foot being in place, the left foot, to go up for a dynamic move having to bring the left hand over to the edge. Right now, the climber is taking some time adjusting the grips which means that he's hesitating and can take energy away when having to engage on that power for the dynamic move. Once the climber had incorporated pressure onto the right hand accurately, the climber can lean on the right hand and quickly sense the left leg that was out on the flag to come into a high placement, crossing it over the right leg. Now once the climber applies pressure to that foot at height, then the climber can release the right foot from its place. The climber was able to send the left hand up for a reach, this one being a pinch grip. The climber then forces a squeeze and is able to apply weight by leaning back on the grip. Now in order for the climber to go for that reach, the climber's right leg has been extended and the toe was pressing against the wall. That way the climber was supported when pushing down on the right foot to gain direction when making the reach out left. Here the climber is shaking his hands and this is how the climber can warm up the hands as well as releasing any tension that may be built up from previously performing. As the climber released the right foot, he had sent the leg extended for a flag where it was initially a back flag and the climber brings it under the right hand grip so that he's able to balance the position to keep his center of gravity underneath the hold that was supported the highest. And then quickly once he gained position of the leg being extended below the right hand, the climber quickly releases the left hand to bring it into a high position. The leg extended helps the climber to shift the weight over to the highest foot as well as keeping the hips square and stay in position when making the reach. Since the climber brought the right hand for a reach, open-handed to place it on top of a lobe of the hold. This one, the climber has to remain open-handed and apply friction at the fingertips that are placed on top of the pores, meeting the hold. So now the climber has to create pressure by leaning on the hold. In order for him to power through and release some of the pressure at the hand to replace the hand to have a better friction, is the reason why the climber's left leg that was extended had to go on up in the kick so that the climber was able to release some of the pressure at the top for the adjustment. The left leg being extended, this is called flagging out, and this is so that the climber can balance over the areas of support. It also shifts the weight over to the right foot being in place. And since the climber is keeping the left leg extended, it helps the climber to keep his right side towards the wall, as the next move would have to be releasing the right hand to go up for reach. The climber is chucking up his hands. This will help the climber to absorb any sweat that may be coming from the hands as well as gaining a better grip when sustaining the holds. As the climber was going up for the reach, his left foot has come out of place. This didn't allow the climber to have completed placing the grip above the hold. So now the climber will be coming off the wall. The climber then chooses to lower his right hand to go back onto the previous hold, but this time he places the hand as a pinch as he's wrapping both sides with the hand. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet when making a foot switch. So the climber has brought the right leg that was extended to bring the right foot to be placed where the left foot is and he needs to do this where he pulls tight on the grips to release some pressure down at the feet and on this one the climber sends the right toe to come into position at the hold before releasing the left foot from its place. The climber is starting at a one hold start where he places both of the hands to the sides of the hold. This is called matching because both of the hands are in the same hold. The right hand, he's sustaining the hold at an open grip. This one, so that the climber can send the thumb underneath the hold to create more pressure at the grip as he is pinching the hold. And we can see that the right hand, he is creating extra pressure because of the knuckles bending up to apply pressure with the fingertips towards the top area of the hold. And the left hand, it's placed just with the fingertips above and the climber wraps the hand around to the side to apply pressure with the palm on the left edge of the hold. The climb will start until the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall and no longer is touching the mat. Later on, the climber is blowing off any excess chalk that's in the hands, so it doesn't cake over the hold that he will initially start on. And cake means that is when there is multiple application of layers of chalk on top of the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He could have eliminated this step by grabbing all of his utensils at the beginning of the recipe in step one. I would recommend using a fourth of a teaspoon with an egg mixture that only contains one full egg, which is actually one fourth of a cup of liquid measure. Now he has finally grabbed his flat spatula. He needed this earlier to spread out the eggs and cook them more evenly. Here you can see he is adding his chopped veg directly from the countertop, I meant from the cutting board, into the mixing bowl. However, he failed to throw away the shell of his eggs. Eggshells are actually very dirty and they contain a lot of bacteria. So when you crack an egg, you immediately want to throw it into the garbage rather than setting it on your workspace. Here he uses his cutting board with the knife attached to make very thin slices of the red tomato going lengthwise. He appears to actually have a decent skill level in slicing this thinly. However, you can see that there's a gap between his fingers and the actual blade's knife blade. He should have his knuckles pressed up against the blade of that knife so that he doesn't leave himself open for any injury. As his pan heats, he adds what appears to be a one ounce ladle full of oil. This is to grease the bottom of the pan so that the eggs don't stick while cooking. Having an open flame without any dish or pan on top of it in any kitchen setting is a safety hazard. This step of flipping the omelette over and over and over again is really unnecessary. You need to let an omelette cook on both sides, you know, one or two minutes per side until the egg mixture is cooked and that's enough. The flipping is unnecessary. Next, he turns the slices crosswise and he is attempting to chop them into a fine dice. He has chosen a red onion and it looks to be a green pepper. As he is trying to get the flat spatula underneath the entirety of the omelet, you can see that since it is uncooked on the center, he's having a very hard time getting it to stay on the spatula. As the egg hits the pan, you can see very quickly the edges of the omelet are cooking relatively fast, considering that the interior of the omelet is still extremely raw. Here he could benefit from spreading out that egg mixture into a more even layer. Now that the pan is ready, he swirls the pan in a motion to elicit the oil spreading out over the surface of the griddle pan. This is so that all of the portions of the pan are covered in oil so that when the eggs hit the pan, they will not stick. Next he is going to prepare his egg mixture and he gathers his tools to do that task which includes a cutting board and a knife that is attached to the cutting board and then his ingredients. He adds roughly one and a half teaspoons of ground paprika and that's a tremendous amount of paprika for this egg mixture, which is really only about a fourth of a cup with liquid measure. Step one of cooking an omelet is gathering all of the tools and the ingredients that you are going to use for this recipe. His next step is to season the egg mixture, which it appears he has a kosher salt here, or iodized salt, and he is using about a half of a teaspoon. He cracks his single egg into the mixing bowl directly with a spoon. He could have done this on the countertop or the edge of the mixing bowl, but this is a fairly adequate way to get the egg into the bowl without having any spillage onto the countertop. And while he is successful in turning at this time, you can see quite a bit of splatter as he turned it, which meant that his center of the omelet was very raw. Alternately, you could use butter or pan spray, any type of oil, just something that contains fat so that when the eggs cook they don't stick to the bottom of the pan. Here he is mixing his egg mixture in the mixing bowl with a spoon. I would always recommend using a fork or a whisk in this scenario since you could incorporate more egg, I'm sorry, more air into the egg mixture with a fork or a whisk and make your omelet fluffier. He has selected a flat top griddle, which is like a cast iron skillet. And here you can see as he attempts to flip the omelet, he actually tears it and rips it at this one point where he hasn't let it cook long enough and hasn't spread out in the mixture enough for it to actually be ready to flip. He mistakenly starts with step one of lighting the stove top without a pan on top.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

There's a mixture with him of short, smaller touches that are sort of under hit and then these touches that get away from him. This is another example of the ball just getting away from him and having to grab the ball with the bottom of his foot to then pull it back to then go in this direction. So he's not moving very fluidly through these cones. It's very choppy. It's very sporadic, right? So I think a challenge that he could have and something that we've done before is that you could give a player a target objective of saying if you're coming from this direction and you're dribbling this way that your hips always need to try to face forward as much as possible. And the same thing if he's coming from this way to go this way is that his hips always face forward as much as possible. You can see that those hips are facing the side or the fence here in this picture. That could help him dribble or force himself to figure out techniques to be able to dribble, to stay facing the way in which he's going and keep moving with the ball, perhaps out in front of his body more. Yeah, I liked how he started this part of the sequence where he was coming around, he started really tight to this cone, I think, which was great. But then he took a heavy touch, and that heavy touch brought him far outside the cone. You can see where he has to catch the ball and now come back a bigger distance in this direction. So I think this is really, I think this is actually like the intention of it's good. He just needs to stay as close as he can to these cones to get to there, and then he can push through that space. That would be the challenge, is that he stay tight to the cones as much as possible. This is also just something from a setup perspective that this cone is so detached from the exercise that he's working on. If he just put the cone here, like in the same spacing that's between these cones, I think that would be really helpful for him to do the exercise. You know, one thing that he could do is as he keeps going here, this could just be a continuous exercise where he goes around here and then comes back around in this direction. So we would call that like a closed chain loop. He in this case is coming from here and instead of going around this direction, he's coming here and he's stopping and he's going around that direction and sort of restarting. So I think if it was going to be a continuous exercise, he should do the first way where he just tries to keep it close to go around here. If this is going to be an exercise where he resets after he dribbles through the cones and gets to this point and resets and then does the same thing, go back in the other direction, that's another thing. It just needs to be determined at the start of the exercise. Yeah, here and just like a lack of efficiency and how you get around and keeping that ball out in front of him. The ball got kind of behind him and underneath him. And you can see here he's pulling now the ball across his body back underneath that direction. In terms of the exercise of dribbling, what we would prefer is that that ball stay slightly out in front of him the entire time if he's working on that as a skill. If he was working on skill moves or turns that were different than just dribbling around the cone with the inside or the outside of the foot, then what he's showing in this picture could be appropriate. But for this drill or this exercise, it's not something that we would want to happen. We want to keep that ball out in front of his body as much as possible. You know again a really consistent theme with him is that as he gets into this position and he tries to go back this direction is that he's over hitting the ball across his body or high and he has to grab the ball with the bottom of his foot and pull it back in this direction to then hit it in this direction. So it's inefficient in terms of the number of touches that he needs to take. So if he can be a little bit more mindful of the strength of his touch, if he's going to control it here, that it's just a soft controlling touch, so less power, and that allows him then to set up for another, a second touch to move him in this direction. That would be what I would, I think he needs to focus on doing. A lot of those errors are actually recurring with his left foot touching the ball this way as opposed to his right foot. So just something to make note that it's probably not his strong foot. Yeah, this is a great touch. I mean, inside of the foot, he chopped down on that ball with his foot, and now it's driving the ball all the way across to here where he can then move with his body and catch that ball. I like that. And you see here, his arms are out to the side. That gives extra support and balance. He's slightly bent over with that upper body. You can see that his support leg is bent, so his hips have been slightly lowered. Yeah, there's a lot of good stuff that's happening in this clip. When he brings that foot down to the ground and he chops it, though, that foot is entirely going flat on the ground. It'd be nice to see that heel up in the air and that on the ball of the foot being what's contacting the ground. So the subject is performing a cone dribbling exercise where he's just being asked to dribble through these spaces. He's going to create a figure eight and he's going to control the ball and dribble as closely and as quickly through these cones as possible with using any surface of the foot that he would like to use. One thing right away that I want to just point out is I like that he has a slight bend in this knee. He's not moving at a super fast pace so at least he has a bend in his knee. I think that would be good. He has a slight upper body lean over the ball, head down, tracking the ball. I like that there. That's pretty good. The one thing about his support foot though is it's totally contacting the ball, meaning it's flat on the ground almost completely, at least in this freeze frame or this moment. What I prefer to see is that he stay on the ball of his feet. Lift that heel off the ground, keep the ball of his foot planted on the ground. It would allow him to be a little bit more athletic in the sense of being able to push off in either direction and he can be quicker with his footwork. Yeah, I mean, this is what we don't want to have happen is the ball gets way out from him underneath him. He loses control of the ball. So now he's all tangled up, completely out of balance. And a lot of what he's doing is just very choppy as he's walking and sort of kicking this ball or dribbling this ball. You know, perhaps what could be beneficial for him would be actually to create more space in between the cones. So if he were only going to use three cones, maybe he'd double the space in between them, which would give him more grace or more space to be able to slalom through each one. I think that would probably help him given his skill set. Because right now when it's too tight, it doesn't really allow him to move all that naturally with the ball because he has to like very, very quickly, very quickly contacted in addition to take very quick steps throughout. Yeah, so again, he's using that top of the foot or the bottom of the foot, sorry, to catch the ball on top of it. This is just because he took a heavy touch in this direction here going forward as opposed to taking it through the cones and going in that body, in that direction. Part of that is just because he, the weight of that touch that he took, instead of trying to just like control it, stop it, or manipulate it this way in a single touch, he actually tried to just take like a touch forward in front of him, and then he wanted to bring a touch across, but the touch was too hard, and so now he's stuck putting this foot on the ball to pull it backwards in this direction to then move in that direction, which is just inefficient. It's slowing the whole process down at this point. So, here as he's going through these cones and he has to go back in this direction here, this is probably an inefficient way to do so, where he's essentially putting his right foot on top of the ball here. So there's no, he's not manipulating the ball in any way that's going to move it in this direction. So this way he could either pull it back or he could kind of push it across, but it's going to be hard to get it to where he wants to get to, to then continue around these cones and go from there. So I would recommend that he would try to either use the inside of his left foot that hit the ball across his body. He could use the outside of his right foot to contact it on this side as well, but any surface to get the ball here. And perhaps what would help define that for him is just selecting a surface to use and sticking to it, whether that just be only inside the feet or whether that be use the outside of the feet or the laces. If he selected a surface, it would help. So I like this as a skill that if the ball is here and because he dribbles a lot with the inside of his feet, he's moving at a walking pace, so this makes sense actually. One of the things he does is he'll use this what's called a cut catch where the ball is placed here. He'll take it across his body with that right foot by touching it with the inside of his foot and he'll catch it on this side with his left foot. It's a really useful skill when you're going through these cones, especially if the ball gets sort of caught too far to the cone here and he can't go through it like diagonally. He's got to bring it more straight across. It's a really good skill to be able to use.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He wants to jump to it. It seems like he probably doesn't have to jump to it, but maybe that's just more his style. But I think if he is gonna jump for it, kind of start from this locked off position isn't the greatest. He kind of wants to sink in. Kind of drop down and then kind of pull over to this right foot and spring off the right foot instead of kind of solely doing it on his arms. So he's kind of a little bit more springy. These holds are good so he can swing around more. Looks like he's quite comfortable on them. They all look pretty big and in-cut. So he's kind of able to launch himself around, swing around pretty comfortably, which might save some energy by moving faster instead of kind of taking your time and slowly bearing down just because he is comfortable with those holds. And then by jumping he's gonna have to cut his feet so his feet do rip off So that means he's got a hold this kind of swing out And then he also has to kind of hold all that weight on those two arms that have his feet on So I don't know if this is the best idea But he does make it work But it still follows some basic technique like getting opposite pose. He's got left hand on. He's not bending that arm too much, keeping it nice and straight, but still tension. So he gets the right foot up, so that way he's opposite pose. That kind of lets him drive up and reach up with his right hand and stay kind of nicely balanced out.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You know, she's not really stepping into the pass. She's just counting on her body to, from the point of takeoff, that this is all we get in here. It's not a lot of legs initially. This doesn't look too bad, but I think that guide hand may, it just, the palm needs to stay faced in. It's doing something as it comes off the ball, which could cause a little bit of some sort of pressure here for the ball to kind of go off target. I love her shooting hand behind the ball. That looks very, very nice. Then she takes her time. Again, you're going to be defended quickly. Spread our feet just a tad here. I like how she's looking, but again, if this was a shooting drill, you don't have that time. You're going to be guarded. Again, here comes the pass, standing straight up, locked out, feet together, kind of bends over a little bit here at the... Again, we need this right hand to catch the basketball, not the left, because she's right handed. Let's go get it. Let's go get this pass. Be aggressive here. Here, she didn't even move to get it. And again, see her hands? She's right-handed shooter, so she's kind of using the opposite hand to backstop it. We need this right hand to be behind the ball and the left hand on the side. So let's switch up our hands here, even when we catch it. Bend our knees, drop our hips, go get this pass. Again, here's her release. It looks a little flat here, if you will. See how the the arms kind of flat and set up? I think she's snapping the wrists. Again, the guide arm just needs to stay in there and not come be jerked back. Again, I really feel like that left toe is pointing to the sideline. We need to turn that left hip in so it's facing the basket, the baseline that you're shooting at. Let's get that arc up. Again, she's dribbling it. For the sake of this drill, it's more of a catch and shoot sort of drill. You don't really have time to dribble it. If it was a free throw, that would be fine. But you dribble it, you're defended. She looks down, takes her eyes off the target. So again, let's speed this up. Let's be a catch and shoot kind of girl here. Here's the shot. Good extension of that right elbow. Uh, can't really see. I think there's a good follow through here. So that looks good. Beautiful extension of the hips. I think the feet are a little bit close together. Um, she is getting off the ground, but really didn't step into the pass. This is all from a stand still position. I'm really not sure what this guide hand or arm is doing. Looks like she's kind of pulled it back really tight, curled that wrist in. We just want it to be in a natural position out here, with the palm facing the other arm. Here's the shot. Again, see how the feet are touching. We want them apart, balanced, cushioned on the landing. Hold that follow-through more out in front of you instead of up. Again, that follow through comes across the body, again pops that elbow out, get that elbow in, let's square up that left leg. Again, here's her landing. We'd love to see more of a balanced landing. Drop the hips. Settle leaning back here. Let's hold that follow-through out. See how it pops out? That elbow pops out. We want it to be more in line. And any of this little extra movement can throw off the ball going to the basket. Again, she lets that ball hit her all the way in the chest. Again, just not a ready, ideal ready position to receive a pass. And that's a big part of being a great shooter, is what are you doing in preparation to catch? Here, the feet are kind of flat-footed here, left foot's that way, right foot's this way, we're locked out here, we're bent over. Not really sure where the basket is at this point. See how we're looking down? Again, let's have a smoother follow-through, instead of jerking the arm up and back. More balanced landing, but you can see this left foot, how it's pointed out. That left knee is pointed to this sideline over here. We want to square our entire body, every bit of it, square to the basket, facing the basket. Again, nice. This is not bad. Ball coming off the pads of these fingers. I don't even know what the guide hand's doing. We don't really want it to move. We just want it to stay, like if it was on the side of the ball like it's supposed to be, that palm would still just be facing in. Here it looks like it might have been in the shot just a little. It's not in the shot, but it's doing something here to throw off the balance of the body. Again, let's square this left hip up, this left ankle, knee. I like how the ball's leaving that shooting hand. Again, here's the shot, the ball's leaving these fingers. That looks good. Let's keep this guide hand more up here in line with the right arm instead of jerking it back. Pretty good little lift here from just going up from a stationary position. I think she could get more legs if she would meet this pass and step into it to shoot. Here's the shot. Trying to, here's extending the hips. Looks like that left leg's kind of, knees kind of turn to the sideline. Let's keep all our entire body square to the basket. Here on the follow-through, it looks like that shooting arm kind of goes across the body, which sends that elbow out. We want that elbow in. Keep that shooting arm in line with the flight of the basketball. Again, that guide hand sort of jerks back. Not sure if that's a factor here. Again, we just, we really just don't want it to be involved with the shot itself. Here's the shot. Again, would love to see this follow-through be a little more smooth and in line with the trajectory of the basketball. Hold this palm of the guide hand, the left hand, facing this arm. It kind of seems like it curls back. Not sure what it's doing to the shot itself. But here she's got some nice lift. I love her verticality. She's got really good extension of the hips here. Again, feet are farther apart, which is nice to see. Looks like she's a little more square to the basket. I like how she's looking up over the ball. Looks like she's shooting hands behind the ball, the left hand on the side. Here the shooter's shooting a 15-foot jump shot. She took a dribble. I really, it's not a free throw. I think we could do without the dribble. We need to just shoot it. Spread these feet a little bit more. I love how she's bending the knees and dropping the hips. She's looking over the top of the basketball, which is nice. So far, so good. Again, she dribbles it. Not what I'm looking for in this jump shooting drill. It's not a free throw. That's a whole nother thing. We need to catch and shoot because you don't have time to dribble. You're gonna be defended. You look down at the ball, taking our eyes off our target. Plus, she's locked out here. We need to be low and be soft and bend our knees and drop our hips. Get low to the ground. Again, here comes the pass. Is she ready? Can she back up and really step into this pass? Whether it's a two foot stop or a one-two stop, plant and elevate. Here she's kind of locked out here. Feet are stationary. She's kind of bent over a little bit, but let's go get this pass before a defender steps in and steals it. Good. Here she begins to lift it. Again, let's spread those feet a little because that way we can at least push off and get a little bit more of a lift here. Here's the shot. Again, she really brings those feet close together. Let's start with having a really shoulder-width stance, balanced, feet apart. She does bend her knees, drops her hips here. I love how she eyes the target over the top of the ball. That looks good. Again, here's the landing, little weights a little bit back on her heel. Well, she's on the balls of her feet, but the weight, you can see the body's not in line here with the knees. Let's drop the hips, bend our knees on this landing, hold this follow-through out so it follows the flight of the ball. She kind of pops it up. And again, it just kind of probably throws off the rotation, the spin, if you will, on the basketball. Here's the landing, balls in flight. Again, a little bit of an off-balance landing. You see a lot of the weight's on that right leg. Let's land with our weight kind of evenly distributed across both knees and ankles and feet. Hold that follow throughout. She kind of jerks that arm back, if you will. You can see it right here. Let's keep it out there, nice and smooth, one motion. Here comes the shot. She does bend her knees, but again it's all just get from the knee bend, not a really explosive step through here. Feet are a little bit together, left foot's pointed out. We need to again square her entire body to the basket or to the baseline. This, this looks good here. She's looking over top of the ball at her target. Here she begins to extend her body. She goes up on the balls of her feet. Good extension of the hips here. I believe the shooting hand is here behind the ball. The guide hand comes off. The palms kind of facing the wall. Love to see that the palm of the hand facing more of the basketball.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Right before they drop down to be softer, they can get a little bit louder so they have a bigger contrast. Because of the bowings that they're choosing for this piece, they're using a lot of bow to get back to the frog. They could come up with different bowings that would make it sound more coherent and have better bow distribution. When approaching the frog, their wrist is coming up a bit which is resulting in them losing some of their sound. They can try to keep their wrist as flat as possible so they can keep as much weight into the bow as possible. They start playing some chords using two fingers to play on two different strings. Again, this is a section when they're playing at the tip that they could actually have a lot more articulation if they pronated more with their hand and possibly brought up their arm to have more leverage into the bow. In their left hand, they often have fingers that are flying up when they have the higher fingers down. This results in more tension in the hand, but also is just inefficient. To help with better coordination, they should make sure that their fingers are as close as possible to the fingerboard, and also being held down if it's a lower finger and a higher finger is being played. Let's start playing some fast chords. Again, this is another section where they're playing out the tip and not getting the best sound that they could. In this section, they could try to play a little bit closer to the frog, but if they wanted to play closer to the tip, they just need to make sure that they're pronating more into the bow. The violin starts to rush here a little bit. Then you make sure that they have a metronome on, just to help their rhythm. The violist never really actually gets close to playing to the frog, which could be their preference for this section, but I've noticed also they're not utilizing their upper arm. They can use it to bring it forward a little bit more so they can use the full bow. The valance is using four bows to get a four sound. Intonation is not great when they're playing this handshape. They can try to bring their arm a little bit further around and have their pinky a little bit more curved to help with the handshape. Additionally, they just need to make sure that they practice these chords slowly and make micro adjustments until the chord sounds in tune. This shift that they just did happens a little bit too fast, resulting in it being out of tune. They can make sure that they just practice very slowly to make sure that they know where they need to go. And then when playing, make sure that they take enough time to feel like they are relaxed to land the note properly. Again, this is another example with their first fingers flying up while the rest of the fingers are down playing. This is creating more tension in the hand, but especially when they have to play the first finger again, they're creating more distance that the first finger will have to travel in order to play the note that they're going to. Again, this is another section where they're staying out into the tip of the bow. They're getting a decent sound, but they could get even better if they were to raise their arm a little bit and pronate more to get a little bit more weight into the string. They're trying to do some vibrato here at this really high note, but their finger is flat which will result in them not getting a lot of range of motion. If they can bring their arm a little bit further around so they have more plane on the tip, then they can get more of a range of motion on the vibrato that will come through. During the string crossing section, they're using a lot of bow vertically to get from one place to another. This is resulting in the string crossings to be really quite sharp. They can make sure that they have more of a horizontal approach and balance more between the strings using less bow. This will result in being more clean, but they'll also have more control. During this section, the chords that they're playing are not in tune. It would be good for them just to isolate each chord and make sure that they're playing them as in tune as possible, and then transition from one chord to the next, doing this as slowly as possible so that they are not making any mistakes. Again, the left hand here isn't getting as much clarity as it can. Because of the flying fingers, there's extra coordination that's not necessary. They should just practice very slow movements, trying to make sure that all of their fingers are close to the fingerboard, or down when they can be. They're starting to rush during this section. This is a section that provides a lot of technical difficulties, but they should always remind to feel grounded in the tempo that they're playing. It'd be good for them just to practice this slowly with the metronome. Again, another example of their fingers being really far away from the fingerboard. This makes it extremely more difficult for them playing this really fast passage. It also ends up being cleaner and sound more efficient if they were closer to the fingerboard. They make a couple of mistakes here and then they get back on track. Again, this is another example where their fingers are getting really high off the fingerboard, especially in a really fast passage like this. This is making them have more effort for them, but also starts to become a bit uncoordinated. They should just try to keep their fingers as close as possible to the fingerboard. They get a nice clear sound here at the tip because their arm is a little bit higher and they're able to get more leverage into their hand. They just did an expressive shift up the string. This is another section where they're playing at the tip that I feel like they could use a little bit more articulation. Even if it's a legato smooth note, they could use more weight just to feel like the sound gets up more. They should have more pronation in their hand and they can actually use their arm to come up a little bit more to help get more of that leverage. Again, during this section, because of the violinist's flying fingers, they're not getting the best coordination. I also believe since they've been playing for a while and doing this, their left hand is probably getting tired and not being able to be as efficient or clear as possible. They're also getting a really nice sound here because their bow is very parallel with the bridge. This section just sounds a bit frantic. It'd be good for them just to practice this very slowly. When playing this legato stroke, they start off a little bit slow and then they get into the speed of the bow that they want. They should practice so that they start right from that new down bow the speed that they want. The violinist is vibrating here a bit. The vibrato is really quite narrow. You can try to open it up a little bit more by getting more range of motion on the fingertip. You can see on their bull hold that their thumb is squeezing a bit. They can make sure that they are playing on more of the tip of the thumb and have more of a rounded, curved joint around the thumb. The violinist is using their bow to break up these chords by playing the first two notes here and then moving their bow over here very quickly to play the rest of the chords. This ascending line starts to sound a little bit out of tune. You can see also from their fingers starting to play a little bit more flat. This starts losing the structure of the hand. If they can play more with their fingertips, they'll have a more dependent, reliable shape of the hand that will allow them to play more in tune consistently. Here, they're not super coordinated with their left hand. They kind of falter and make some mistakes. It would really serve them well to have their fingers as close as possible to the fingerboard, so whenever they're making transitions, they have less movement to make. They're using a good amount of coordination between the bow and the left hand here. They're using a good combination of using shorter amounts of bow for short notes and then a longer amount of bow for the longer notes. They could still have some more articulation, I feel like they just need more pronation in their hand. The violinist is trilling between two fingers. They just did an expressive shift where they shifted downward and had a little bit of a slide for more of an expressive sound. Again, this is another section where they're playing at the tip and they're not getting a lot of articulation. Their bow hold looks a bit neutral. They can try to rotate from their arm more into the bow so that they get more articulation and weight into the tip. These chords are happening a little bit too fast. This is the conclusion of the piece, and for it to be more grand, they could spend a little bit more time on these chords. While playing out the tip, to get more articulation, you can try raising their arm a little bit more to get more leverage through the hand and get weight through the bow so they get more articulated sound. The violinist pulls back their hand to do a little bit of a mini shift here. When doing a glissando in a romantic repertoire, in this case, they can try to actually do a little bit more so it sounds more purposeful.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She has those arms really straight up in the air with fists at the bottom. But just throughout the whole routine, she always had really sharp arm movements and everything had a really clear place, which really makes for a nice viewing experience. So here she's doing a body roll, really good job. It goes through her whole body, her knees are bent. And just really good job overall. The dancer is starting with a salsa front and back and she is stepping forward on her left leg and stepping back with that left leg. She's doing a good job rotating her arms around and using her hips and also has a nice spin in her knees. So watching this performance, it was just a really, really good performance. I could see this being taught. I could see this as a Zumba class. Like, she really just captured what the piece needed to be and just did a really, really great job. So this is a really great example. So here, this is a really good job just in control and body control. She first did a turn over here and then moved to this side of the room, and then did another spin and turn and she was able to stop herself right on the beat. So really good job just controlling her body and spotting and getting across the room with this movement. So here the dancer does a twist. She goes up on her toes as you see there, and then she twists her hips over to the left and then back down.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Picking and finger picking and normal picking is quite challenging at the same time. He does a really good job getting the bottom notes to speak very clearly and then has the top chords also speak really clearly with a good amount of energy between the three fingers that he's using to pluck.

I would encourage this dancer to take a pause because they have a lot of great energy, but sometimes they're on the music and sometimes they aren't. I think there's opportunity for this dancer to improve this movement by making sure that they incorporate their hips. A lot of times they use their feet and their shoulders and their arms and sometimes even their ribcage, but their hips were very stationary throughout this entire movement. Again, I will repeat my previous comments about making sure that they're on the music and on the beat.

Here the dancer appears to struggle through some transitional movements, connecting one movement phrase to the next. She would benefit from using her arms a bit more fully and finding some clarity in the choreography of her arms, as well as finding some additional clarity in the movement of her feet.

As the dancer transitions through a couple of different movements that locomote her through the space into this movement right here where she's undulating or moving her shoulders in a circular motion, she would benefit from finding some additional clarity in her footwork as well as finding some stability in her movement to help her connect more deeply to the rhythm. Here she's got a nice bend in her knees, though she would benefit from bending them a bit more deeply as well as separating her feet to find a little bit of a wider foundation to her movement.

She's also able to perform this turn around herself with efficiency because she's spotting her head, which is helping her to move quickly through this turn without falling off balance. Again, she would benefit from bending the knees more deeply, being more grounded in her movement, and finding some more natural clarity in her arms. But overall she's able to stay connected, particularly to the tempo of the music, while maintaining the integrity of the movement. As the dancer begins with a basic kind of stationary salsa step, she's able to connect to the rhythm, particularly through the use of her footwork and her lower body in general. And while she's engaging her arms choreographically, they're a bit stiff, which I feel is holding her back from connecting to the rhythm. If she were to loosen up through her shoulders and her spine in general, as well as through her pelvis, but particularly through her torso, she'd be able to move her arms more fluently and introduce some interesting movement dynamics. As the dancer continues through some basic salsa steps that locomote her through the space and turn her around herself, she continues to maintain consistency in her inclusion of the arms. She's able to really clearly perform choreography with the arms, though again would benefit from loosening up through the shoulders and the spine a bit more. And she continues to maintain consistency over her hold over the movement vocabulary and rhythmic embodiment. While she doesn't fully embody the rhythm because of that stiffness, particularly in her upper body and the lack of grounding, she is able to maintain consistency with the tempo of the music without falling off rhythm in the transitional moments. As the dancer begins to locomote through the space with a basic cross step, moving side to side, she continues to struggle with a bit of stiffness in her arms and upper body, though I have to commend her for keeping her upper body engaged fairly consistently. However, this stiffness is really keeping her from deeply embodying the rhythm. She would also really benefit from bending her knees more and dropping her pelvis back to be more grounded in her movement, to help with that rhythmic embodiment, as well as being able to move more quickly and efficiently and with fluidity through the movement.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

We see that her left leg is bent. It's also not exactly at her side. So her leg should really be a bit more behind her and in an exact straight line instead of bent as it is right here. She can make this movement bigger by incorporating her hips and her shoulders instead of just tapping her feet and bringing her arms forward. The dancer now remembers the arm choreography and incorporates it, but her arm never reaches a fully straight position. They're very graceful as we see she's holding her hand with ease, but it never actually reaches the appropriate position which should be fully extended in front of her. The dancer's weight is on her toes when she does this basic dance step, so she's able to move forwards to the center and backwards again to the center with great ease because her weight is distributed on her toes. Her heels are up in the air, so she's able to pick her feet up and transfer directions very quickly and easily. The dancer has slight chest action when she pumps her chest forward, which is okay, but if she's going to do this and she should be doing it even larger, making the movement even bigger, so it seems apparent right now how she's doing it's very subtle and almost looks a bit awkward or just not purposeful if she meant to do it or if her chest just released forward as a result of momentum. So if she's going to pump out her chest, that's a great way to make the movement bigger, but then she has to make this very apparent and really pump it out forward to a larger extent. The dancer keeps her shoulders pressed down even when she's bringing her arms both upward and that's great because we're able to see her neck clearly and she looks tall and elongated so this is something that she's doing very well here. Something that the dancer needs to watch out for is how she's opening her rib cage here too much. We see that her spine is arched. It's on a straight line and it's mostly arched because her rib cage is opened. Each side of it is opened. And instead of her releasing her chest forward and opening her rib cage, she should aspire for the opposite. So her rib cage should actually be closing towards her center, towards her belly button so that her back isn't creating this arch that it's doing right here. But in an ideal world, it would actually be in a straight line. The dancer is sliding her feet open as she goes horizontally or moves horizontally. However, the slide that she is doing is very small in width. She'd benefit more if she traveled further and made this a grander step that covered more surface area of the ground. This arm positioning that she is exhibiting here is great. Her arms are completely straight and then she's bent at the wrist. This, she was able to do this very quickly and that's wonderful. The dancer missed the arm choreography as she moved to her left side, her arms remained down. However, her right arm should have been extended forward to the front. This is just a mistake she did in forgetting the arm choreography here. The dancer's hand movement here is very graceful. She always has one hand higher than the other, and this alternates depending on which foot she's stepping on. So here we see she's stepping with her left foot, so her right arm is higher in the air than her left arm. And the way that she is transferring which hand is higher or lower, she's doing very gracefully. None of it is stiff, and it's very much so has a sense of flow.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It's just going off. It's just kind of like dry firing a bow. It's all that energy's going nowhere. That's kind of just recoiling up his body and just pulling himself off the wall and it's just a waste of energy and it's actually kind of hindering his upper mobility too because it's kind of pulling him back now or away from the wall. So right off the bat he kind of places his foot and jumps immediately into this next move What's just in general is just not a good idea because You want to get on a show control for a couple seconds on any climb? That's kind of what the rules would be But by doing so his whole kind of right foot is kind of not in the right position He's just starting from position of really just a position of not being in control Maybe it makes the first move easier to kind of jump into it, but He's not coming from a balance point and so his whole body position is just off from the very moment he leaves the ground Again, kind of does this kind of jumpy foot swap. You can see his left leg kind of already falling out from the wall. His arms may be nice and straighter, but his whole hips and lower body is really having a struggle.

So one thing that separates a beginner from an advanced is an advanced dancer would have just kept on going, would have figured it out, improvised until they got back on the music. So I think she could have really done that if she really focused on not stopping because when you perform, you can't always stop the show and keep on going. So I think a little improvising would have definitely helped to get her back on track. So the dancer starts stepping forward and back. She does a good job keeping the knees nice and loose, stepping forward and back on her toes, then also rolling her arms around and just keeping the light energy of the music. Here she does a little, what I would call a little Zumba football run, where she's kind of tapping her feet in place. For this movement, it's really great that her knees are bent. Maybe she can just roll her arms a little bit and really shake from, really stepping on her toes as fast as possible, and then that will then affect the rest of her body as it shakes and moves.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They should make sure that they practice this at a slower tempo. It also might be beneficial for them for their performance tempo to be a little bit lower so they can focus on accuracy. The pianist has a really nice relaxed flowing feel in the left hand which is allowing this musical phrase to be really natural. Again, this is another example of the great articulation this pianist uses. They're getting into the key and out of the key very quickly for this short articulation. If this section starts to rush just very slightly, it would be good for them to check this with a metronome. The pianist has really great coordination here. It's very fluid and they're keeping their hands very close to the keyboard which is allowing them their most control. The pianist is also using the tips of their fingers, which is allowing them to get more articulation and control in these faster notes. When playing these faster notes, the pianist is keeping their hand very close to the keyboard, which allows them to be more efficient. The pianist is utilizing their forearm motion to help them get their hand down to this part of the keyboard. The pianist starts to slow down, creating a ritardando. The pianist is using their forearms slightly to go back and forth with these notes. They're using a bigger muscle group to help them be more efficient. Again, this is another example of how efficient this pianist's hands are. They're very close to the keyboard and they're using a curved hand with the fingertips being playing on the keys. This is allowing me to play this very fast section with a lot of clarity. The balance between the hands here is really nice. They have really great control. The pianist uses more weight in these chords to create a very powerful sound. The pianist is using more of a fluid motion with their wrist and arm to help them get around the keyboard and create this very fluid sound. The pianist is starting to lose a bit of coordination here. It'd be good for them just to practice this very slowly, just so they make sure they know where all their notes are. The pi\u00e8ce is using this nice motion of coming off the keyboard really quickly and getting some space, then coming back down to create this very short articulation. The left hand is starting to rush a little bit here. It'd be good for them just to isolate this hand by itself and play with the metronome so they have more control. They're not getting as much articulation in the left hand as they could. They're using a lot of their wrist motion. It could be helpful for them to feel like they're leading more with their elbow and upper arm. The pianist is using a lot more weight into the keys playing these chords, which is creating this very rich sound. The pianist puts more weight into this last chord to create a louder sound. They're losing some articulation from some of these notes. They might have more of a horizontal approach here. It'd be good to make sure that they have a lot more weight in their elbow to make sure that they can get a little bit further into the keyboard. The piano is keeping a very even tempo. It's very steady. The PS holds the key a little bit longer for this longer note. To get a longer legato note in the right hand, spend more time in the key.

And he does this while the swing momentum, where once the climber had cut out feet and the feet were coming back onto the wall, then the right hand that was on the lobe of the pinch or of the area of the hold has been brought up to come into place into this safe grip. The climber right now has brought his left foot to come into place next to the right. Now the climber is matching with three limbs on the same hold, all of them being pulling onto the same edge. This one the climber needs to make sure that he distributes the weight well and applies pressure onto both of the feet so that the climber is able to release the right hand from its place to bring the right hand into a match at the hold down below. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet. Most importantly because the climber is positioned horizontally. So the climber needs to make sure that he makes an accurate foot positioning as it is not the normal of being positioned when it's down. And if it was done by feel, he might miss the foot placement to be correct. So the climber sends the left foot to come into match at the right foot. And it's because the climber will be making a foot switch. So he would apply first pressure onto the left toe to press into the hold before the climber releases the right toe from its place. Here the climbers left hand has moved two moves consecutively. When he makes the first move that's a move but when he does it again this is called bumping. But this one before he bumps this is now considered another move because the climber did take some time below to adjust his center of gravity. Since he was unstable he needed to find a way of balancing over the right foot. The balance of the right foot was because the climber needed to make sure that his places of support were solid before he moved the left hand up for the reach. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet, especially if he's going to be doing a foot switch. So in this one the climber has brought the right leg that was extended, which was out on a flag. This was out on a flag before because the climber was placing weight onto the left toe to keep him in balance, but quickly sends the right foot to come into place at the same hold. In order to release the left foot, the climber must apply pressure on the right foot that came into place before releasing the left foot from its hold. The climber starts until the climber is no longer standing on the mat and once gets to feet position onto the wall. Now the climber is placing the weight over the areas where he has contact with the wall then the climber starts. As we can see the climber once placed the left hand onto the jug, this one being positive. The climber's left foot has to slip out of the wall. Now the climber is forcefully swinging out of the wall and this is called cutting feet. Now the climber must be able to sustain the swing by pulling hard on the grips, potentially pulling onto a slight pull up, this one, so that the climber is able not to slip off the holds. As the climber glances over to what the next hold he has to go at reach, the climber brings the left foot into place at the big foothold that he had remained for his right foot being in place but sends the left foot to come to a match, meaning both limbs on the same hold. In this one, the climber will have to release the left pinch to go up for that next hold since it's the one that is located the lowest. And in order to do this, the climber will release the right foot to be extended so he only applies pressure onto the highest foot being the one on the left to make an easy transition. Once the climber was able to reach and secure the right grip, the climber intentionally releases the right foot, where the climber has no feet for a few seconds, and this is called cutting feet. The climber then had to apply extra pressure at the grips to avoid a forceful swing, and quickly engages the core in order to make a foot placement, first with the left, and the climber then quickly adjusts to set the right foot to come into a high placement, which helps him be positioned when making the next move. Here the climbers toes or foot placement have slipped out of the hold. As we can see the climber was trying to release the right hand and the feet came off the edge because the climber wasn't extending the leg to drop the weight to keep the foot in place. It's important that the climber extends the legs so that he doesn't release any pressure on them when transferring the hand over to the last hold. This is called a bath hang so the climber needs to first extend the legs to secure the foot placement and potentially even try to raise the heels more so that the climber is able to touch the top area of the hold in order to secure the foot placement. The climber is shaking his hands and it will help the climber to warm up the hands as well as releasing any tension that had been built up. The climber is able to walk over the right hand to the left side of the hold, sustaining the edge every time that it gets walked over. And the climber was able to release pressure on the right hand because of the left hand placement onto the jug. Now the climber has made a space for the right foot to come into place into the hold and sends the toe to be surfaced with the edge. And the toe is actually further in so that the climber is able to pull on the toe when placing pressure onto the foot so the toe can catch with the edge. The climber can, the body extended this one so the climber can sustain his swing and keep the body still in order to quickly engage the core to make a high foot placement. Now the foot placement is towards the left side of the hold which he will be pushing to the right in order for him to gain height going on the opposite direction to the left since we see the left hand coming out of place for the next move. As we can see the left leg is not in place and this one the climber will be using it as a flag. Keeping the leg extended will help the climber to keep his center of gravity to get close to the wall when he hangs and would help the climber also to bring the hip in towards the wall as well as the shoulder when going up for the reach as his reach will be on to the left side. As we can see the climber send his right hand up to a reach to be placed on top of a lobe where the climber sends the hand open-handed and cups it in order to sustain the grip and apply friction onto the hold in order to apply pressure. And it leans on the hold once he secures the grip to apply weight. As we can see in order for the climber to go up to the hold he had to press on his right foot, the one being in position, and has brought the knee inwards so that the climber's right side is close to the wall, helping the climber having an easier reach. The climbers next move is up to a pinch hold where he sends the left hand to be placed with the fingers onto one side and the thumb on the other so that the climbers able to squeeze the hold and the climber must bring his weight onto the grip by leaning back. As we can see the climbers is starting at a one hold start where he places both of the hands on the same hold Both of the hands on the same hold. This is called matching. So the climber is matching the hold by attempting to do a pinch with each hand to sustain the grip The climber once he gets positioned for getting to start on the wall, he will then extend the arms to transfer over weight to the grips", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So he kind of immediately kind of gets scrunched up and decides to do his foot swapping on this high handhold while also having to handfoot match. And he could have foot swapped a little bit lower and saved a little bit of energy. And so now when he goes for it, he is left hand on, left foot on. So you can see his, you know, he's kind of fighting this barn door. So he's turning in, but he's not able to hold it. And actually, when he gets up to it, his whole body kind of barn doors off the wall. And he isn't able to keep this tension or hold himself there. He does get his left foot on and he's doing that so that way he can be opposite pose with his right hand on, left foot on.

Looking at the player release on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player does well. Getting his follow through, snapping his wrist towards the direction of the basket, allowing the ball to travel with the proper amount of spin and rotation it needs to get towards our target area. Looking at the top left corner of the box on the backboard, allowing the ball an accurate angle of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the release of the players right-handed making layup attempt in the right frame, we can notice that the player did well squaring his shoulders towards the back of the rim, allowing the ball a better angle of being directed accurately towards the target. Looking on the left side, we can notice that the ball is heading towards our target area, the top right corner of the box on the backboard, due to this player followed through, snapping towards the direction of the basket, allowing the proper spin and rotation the ball needs to develop the proper angle of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the release of the player's left-handed micing layup attempt, we can notice that the ball is not traveling at all near our target area due to the fact that if we look on the right side of the frame, the player's shoulders are not as squared as we want them to be facing the back of the rim. This will allow the ball a better angle of being directed accurately towards the target. Looking on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player did really well at hitting our target point. The top right corner of the box on the backboard having his follow-through go towards the direction of the target, which is going to be the rim, allowing the ball the proper angle of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the release of the player's right-handed make and layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice that, again, the player does well, scoring his shoulders towards the back of the rim, allowing a better angle for the ball to accurately travel towards our target point. Looking at the player initial start on the right frame, going into his right-handed mic-in layup attempt, an improvement that can help the player become more powerful, balanced, and explosive going towards the rim, is having his body placement position lower in the athletic stance. As a result of our players left-handed micing layup attempt, we can notice on both frames that the ball does not gain enough arc, rotation, and power to travel towards our target area, softly dropping inside the rim. However, will bounce off the rim, resulting in an incomplete layup attempt. Looking at the player on the right frame going into his right-handed Mike and Leib attempt, we can notice that the player does well jumping off his correct foot, which is going to be his left foot, allowing him to carry his body's momentum closer towards the right side of the rim. The player also does a good job locking his eyes on his target before going into his release, allowing a much easier finish. Looking on the right frame as our player is going into his left-handed mic and layup attempt. Again, what can help the player become more explosive on his jump? Creating a higher chance of the ball going towards our target point. Is getting the player lower from his body placement position in the athletic stance, allowing a quicker release going towards the rim. Another improvement that can help the player prevent potential turnovers in a game-like scenario is bringing his ball placement position towards his shoulder area, preferably above his shoulders, allowing more ball security and control going into the finish, as well creating separation from opposing defenders in a game-like scenario, having easy access of stripping the ball from the office player.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Climber made it into that Gaston position smoothly and then tries to bump up into this hold.

Very stable rhythm and creates a great effect of groove, as we would call it. This is a good example of a nice curve to the fingers, a nice natural curve. The only problem is we want to be a little bit further up on the keys, so a little bit more curve so that we can get the first finger also further up on these keys and have more notes available to us. These chords being played in the right hand, these last three chords that were played, very well balanced, great articulation. They sound really good. The notes that were just played with the right hand, the last maybe six notes or so, the rhythm wasn't very stable on them. They were shorter than they should have been for this melody. And a lot of that is because of the tension that we see. Like you can see this tension, this tendon popping out, this tendon popping out. And just by this unnatural curve of the fingers, when we have that kind of tension, we're less accurate because it's harder to control our fingers. So actually being looser will allow him to play with more control, meaning a lot better rhythm. It can control the length and the articulation of the notes better. We should be a little bit softer here. We should have done a decrescendo here, because this is a lower point of the phrase, and that's gonna give us room to grow. So a little bit of decrescendo here, just to make it interesting and give the melody a structure. On those repeated B-flats, we're losing, audibly losing a couple of them. And this is because when you're doing fast, repeated notes on one finger, it's difficult to let the key come all the way back up before pressing it down again. So one way to get around this would be having just a bigger movement in general, so the key's coming all the way up, or doing an alternating fingering on the same key, perhaps two and three on that B-flat, so that you have a little bit more control of it. Those last four high voice notes that were played with fingers 3, 4, 5 in the right hand are getting lost because he's anticipating the shift, so he's leaving those notes too soon. So just make sure to play those a little bit louder and a little bit longer so we can really hear that pickup into the chord. We need a little bit more articulation on those repeated F's in the left hand, losing the clarity there. We need to hear more of this melody that's being played with fingers 4 and 5 just before this. I have to bring that out over this texture a little bit.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

You'll see that the climber is pretty far away from the wall. But they are actually probably able to grab the right hand and maintain the left hand. If this straightens out a little bit more, the climber has plenty of ape to get between both. I think that would be something worth trying. If I were here coaching the climber, I would maybe say, hey, try and just do it without leaving the left hand. But the climber does fall here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So I was able to back down onto that jug, recollect and gain an intention for how to do the finish move, or this finish sequence, I should say. And here they are executing that. And after that sequence, the climber is able to come into this jug off of the second hold in the sequence. So committing to that heel hook, the climber comes in and does a quick match on this hold. Mostly just to open up the hips, to bring the hips from over here to over here, and then back over to get into this right hand here. And after regaining the left hand on the finish hold, the climber is just unable to muster the energy required to get the match in and they just fall off and hopefully get to try again. And after achieving the finish hole with their left hand, the climber just didn't quite know what to do with the feet, so they're now backing down to this jug, which is a good tactic if you get overwhelmed and you do have the option to back down into a jug. So the climber takes that here. Climber then is able to roll out to the finish hold here. They are generally confused as to how to get through this sequence. They looked like they were maybe going to try and hand heel match or hand toe hook match. They decided against that. This is the left hand that they were on, which I know this hold, it's a pretty in-cut, like 20mm edge. And this hold here is an old voodoo sloper, a little half moon action. It's not the best hold in the world, but it's not terrible. And the climber is just figuring out how to get from over here to underneath it over here, which is a pretty tough transition for the climber. Here we have a sit start matched on a jug here. Left hand relatively high, at least for the size of the climber. And looking up at the first hold. After matching this hold, the climber campuses the feet out and are able to get some higher feet here, which were handholds from the previous sequence. Now the climber has a left hold on this crimp rail here, and looking down at what to do with the feet. And after matching this hold with the feet, the climber was able to match this blue hold down here and make a big stand up move to this down pulling jug here. So you can see the climber is pretty stretched out. It doesn't require a ton of core tension. I think all the holds that the climber is on are very good. And this is also just a huge foothold so the climber should be able to maintain a relaxed composure through this. Climber goes up left hand into this jug-like hold and then opts for this inside heel hook. This climber uses an unorthodox technique, just like in general, and this inside heel hook is just a little weird. Ideally the climber would probably either not use a heel hook or get it outside so that the climber can open up their hips a little bit and shoulder in to this left hand hold. But nevertheless, the climber is on two jugs so it doesn't really matter.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

That's going to provide more flavor to the sauce that's being made in the pan from the tomatoes. The cooked scrambled egg is added into the tomato mixture. The egg is being broken up into smaller pieces and heated through so that it's the same temperature as the sauce. Here the garlic, green onions, and chopped tomatoes have been added to the saut\u00e9 pan. The preparer is then taking basically a pancake turner and pressing down on the tomatoes. What he's trying to achieve is he's trying to get the tomatoes to release some of their juices. Now some tomatoes are going to be juicier than others, especially if you have very ripe, larger tomatoes that you cut in quarters or wedges, as opposed to the cherry or grape tomato which is not going to have as much liquid. The preparer has cracked two eggs into a bowl, added some salt, and is using chopsticks to mix the eggs. Chopsticks are an appropriate tool to use for mixing the eggs. Other types of tools you could use would be a fork or a wire whisk. The goal here is that you thoroughly mix the eggs so that you achieve a homogeneous mixture without any streaks of white and yolk separate from the mixture. Here he has three cloves of garlic, which he has taken from a head of garlic. He is using the flat side of the knife to pound a clove of garlic in order to easily remove the skin. The pounding process actually cracks the skin open and makes it much easier to remove. Here the preparer is adding some water to the saute pan that still contains the tomatoes, garlic, and green onion. And this is to help to extract some of the juices out of the tomatoes and also the flavor from the tomatoes and to create a sauce for the eggs. The egg is allowed to sit briefly in the saut\u00e9 pan to begin cooking, and then the preparer takes the chopsticks and scrambles the egg, but only to the point where the egg is still moist and shiny. The egg is then removed from the pan to a bowl. The important thing with cooking scrambled eggs is that they're not overcooked and they are not dried out. So you want to look for that moist and shiny appearance on the outside of the eggs. Here the egg is being added to the pan and you don't hear significant sizzling or any sizzling at all and this is what you want. You want the pan to be warm enough to cook the egg but not too warm in that it browns the egg. Here the preparer has chosen to use either a Japanese or Chinese cleaver for cutting the vegetables. This is an appropriate knife to use, and he is cutting on a wooden cutting board, which is also appropriate. Once the mixture was heated thoroughly, the finished dish is then put into a clean bowl for serving. Here, salt and pepper is being added to the tomato mixture for seasoning. It's important to note that salt will also help counteract any bitterness from the tomato. If the tomatoes are bitter, one could use either salt or sugar to counteract that bitterness. In addition, the salt is added to enhance the flavor of the dish. Here a saute pan has been selected and the heat has been turned on underneath the saute pan to heat the pan up. A neutral flavored oil is being added to the pan. The idea behind a neutral flavored oil is you want the oil to work as creating nonstick in the saute pan, but you don't want the flavor of the oil to be imparted on your dish. So you can use something like a canola oil or a grapeseed oil. Both of those are neutral. Here, cherry tomatoes are being cut in half using the same cleaver as was used earlier. This knife is suitable for this task. However, you can see that the knife is slightly dull. There's resistance trying to cut through some of those tomatoes. So sharpening the knife would improve the ability to easily cut through those tomatoes. The preparer also has a container, which in this case is a bag, to collect food scraps, which is just adjacent to the work area. You can also use a bowl or other type of container, but this is a good practice to have so that your work area stays clean and neat and you collect all your waste scraps in one area.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I like that he picks up the cutting board here and scrapes his vegetables directly into the bowl with his paring knife. Another option would be to hold the bowl underneath countertop height and scrape the vegetables into it that way, or picking up all the vegetables by hand and transferring them to the bowl. But this is a very skilled way to transfer efficiently. Here you can see that in both the instances of finishing the onion and finishing the cracking of the egg, he leaves all of his garbage or waste on the side of his workstation. He would be better served to throw that directly into the garbage can immediately after use so that it doesn't contaminate his egg mixture. I like that he is taking the pan and swirling it to ensure that all of the edges of the pan are coated with the olive oil. This is so that the omelet does not stick to the bottom of the pan once it's added to the pan. He contemplates just pinching it in or eyeballing how much seasoning he needs. And I think it's great that he went ahead and got a measuring spoon so that he knows exactly how much salt he is adding to his mixture. Next he takes his slices and holds them together and comes to crosswise hatches where he is dicing the onion finely. As he cuts the red onion in half, you can notice that he's not 100% comfortable with this knife, even though it's just a small paring knife. He doesn't really know exactly how to most efficiently and effectively cut a red onion. He has his thumb and his finger out holding the red onion, where he should have his knuckles out closest to the blade of the knife. Step two is gathering all of your ingredients. He has chosen a red onion and is getting a egg and a pepper from the fridge. Additionally, he has chosen the correct tool here with which to flip his omelette and the correct timing. So as you can see, almost the entirety of the omelette is cooked by the color visual and he is ready to flip his omelette. Next he cuts his serrano pepper into very thin slices the serrano pepper is obviously a personal preference it will add a great deal of heat to your omelet and Slicing it lengthwise. I'm sorry crosswise in this way is the right method to Use a pepper like this in this recipe He seems confident in making the slices on the red onion half here, although you can see that he still has his finger out holding the red onion as he slices. He should have tucked his finger beneath his knuckles so that he could more efficiently and easily slice the red onion. However, this repetitive motion of swirling the oil again and again, now for the third time indicates to me that he doesn't have a very confident knowledge, or he doesn't have an expert knowledge of how to create this recipe from start to finish. Again, I like here that he folds his omelet in half once it is completely cooked. This is a more traditional way of considering an omelet recipe, is a half fold. He appears to add about one tablespoon of oil. Next he adds a little bit of olive oil to the pan that is heated. This is the correct time to do this step. You could also use butter or cooking spray. He cuts the heat to low and then proceeds to flip the omelet. Here he is rinsing his mixing bowl that he's going to use to make the egg mixture. I always like for the tools and utensils that I use in my recipes to be fully clean prior to starting any recipe, so this is a good step to take. And last, he heats his pan after his egg mixture is already combined. He hasn't whisked it yet, but this is the appropriate time to start the heat on your pan, unless you are an expert at making an omelet. You don't want your pan to get too hot too early, and so he is starting the pan at medium heat at an appropriate time. He flips it one final time to ensure for doneness and then he is ready to serve. That is the last step is to transfer the omelet directly to your serving plate. Cooking an omelette takes about one and a half minutes on the first side and 30 seconds to one minute on the second side depending on how much brownness you want on your omelette. And here he appears to have good color on the first side and is waiting for the second side to get good color. The first step in cooking an omelette is gathering all of your equipment. Here he has selected a frying pan or omelette pan that is non-stick. And using his paring knife he cracks the egg directly over top of the mixing bowl. Another alternative would be to tap it lightly on the edge of the bowl or tap it lightly on the countertop to achieve the same result. He chooses to season his mixture before adding the egg, which is a little out of order. Honestly, he should have waited to season the egg mixture until after the egg was in the bowl. It could go either way. You can see here that the majority of the underside of the omelet is completely cooked. The visual cue here is that most of the egg is cooked, is white or yellow. There's still a little bit of orange here in the center that will cook when he flips the omelet over. After cutting the tip off of the red onion, he should set the paring knife down on the side and peel the red onion without having a knife in his hand. Having the knife in his hand is a dangerous way to peel an onion. Here you can see that he has chosen a spoon to mix his egg mixture. I would recommend using a fork or a whisk so that you can incorporate more air into the omelette. It'll also help in assisting with breaking up the egg white and the egg yolk and to get all of the ingredients combined quicker. When you're ready to serve, you want to cut the heat off of the omelet so it doesn't continue to cook and transfer your omelet successfully in one motion to the serving plate. In order to produce any recipe you need a clean workspace, which he has here. This cutting board looks very clean, has not been used recently and he is taking great care to keep his workspace clean as he works. He adds the egg mixture to the pan in a single layer, and because the pan is already hot and the oil is coating the bottom, his egg mixture begins to cook immediately. He also selects a flat spatula, which will be good in turning the omelet, and a paring knife in order to chop his vegetables.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

It looks like he's testing out if he can get both hands onto this kind of right pinch But he still has to start with his one hand over and so now we can actually see without it With a hand on it. It is a rather small little edge. So it really is gonna encourage him to go left hand at first for this move and Pinch with the right hand and generate from that right hand because that that pinch that little crimp right here is so small And we can see that he hits the hole but just isn't able to hold it. It looks like maybe something with accuracy so he may be onto something and then just kind of getting this move down a little better but so right now he's you know he's hitting the hole but he's just not able to latch it and keep the keep the tension there. I think this one is more about accuracy. He had the right idea, moved the right way but just wasn't able to grab the hold in the right spot and I think that's what's going to kind of come down to this problem is you have this hole that's more accurate so you want to move more slow. They probably have set it up to make you move left hand to it and so by trying to break it he might have some success but it could just be making the problem all around a lot harder.

Here we can see how the climber continues to glance over at the hold at reach and has already swung over to the right and pushed forcefully onto the left foot as he's no longer having contact with the hold. This is once the climber has reached the chest height where the grips are, then he pulls himself into the wall. This is so that the center of gravity follows his body when performing the jump. The climbers is starting at a two hand hold start and as we can see he's applying the grip at the bottom area of the hold The type of hold he's sustaining is rounded with a hold on the inside. This type of hold is called a donut and where the climber gets to place the fingers as far in inside of the hold since there is a groove and Presses down on the fingertips as well as on the thumb placed on the outside in order to secure the grip. As we can see the climber is doing a step up start where he places the feet on to the wall and once the climbers placements are secured Then the climber starts The climber had pushed forcefully on the right hand before releasing it and immediately after the release the climber's right foot was engaged to boost the jump. He is now with flying for a quick fraction of a second and it is important that the climber knows exactly when to boost the move. For this case the climber was making himself close to the wall when pulling himself into the wall but once engaging into the right foot the climber due to rotating his right shoulder out to go out for the reach, his center of gravity was slightly thrown out away from the wall when boosting the right foot for the move. The climber is aiming is the term that we use for glancing over to the hold at reach since he will be performing a dyno and where he's right now building momentum by swinging while he had lowered his center of gravity. This is to keep the feet at a high foot placement and when the climber is ready then he will swing over to that direction at reach and we'll have to press forcefully onto the left foot in order to get that direction and push over with force to spring out of the move. When the climber gets to reach a certain height of the chest reaching by where the grips are he will pull himself towards the wall. This is so that he can drive the center of gravity close to the wall and underneath the hold at reach.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And I was trying to catch it where her hand was kind of bent over, but you can see that and we want to really... Maybe she's too far away. It might be helpful to kind of scoot up toward the piano to have a more... I think it would be helpful to scoot up just a little bit. Maybe she's extending too far and that is not allowing her hands to really have that full grasp of that nice rounded hand position. Okay, so throughout this section She Her memory is like the issue right now is memory loss of the piece and what she is playing and so it would be very helpful to have the music out and to to look through some of those sections you Alright, so she is using the pedal. You can see in her hair her foot is extended using the pedal, but a little more intentional pedaling would help to connect those phrases so that it doesn't feel so choppy and abrasive. All right, and so this left hand going up and down again We have some awkward reaching over the top with the fingers and so slowing that down and really working out those phrases would be very helpful All right, and so we want to be really careful Especially here in those fingers where she's reaching all the way up on top of the keyboard we want to make sure that our fingers are always staying on the piano and That it would it would be helpful to play You know if she could tuck those fingers back in bringing into that rounded C position It would help her even though she's spreading out It would help her to hit those keys more accurately and not feeling like she is Attaching on top of the keyboard Alright, so a bit of a memory slip there again. I think slowing it down Maybe some work with a metronome would be helpful It also I think at this point would be helpful to just have the music that I don't think it's necessary To play it memorized and that would ensure correct pitches All right, so through that we can kind of see that pinky winging up there and we really so my recommendations would be to um, number one trim nails because we can't get a good hand position when We're clicking on the keyboard. Um I would adjust the body position and posture while aligning to the piano and I would really focus on That nice rounded hand position and then in addition I would be working on the Hands alone slowing things down and bringing those pieces out of the memory  Alright, so this is really kind of more what we're looking for. We want to still and in order to fix some of these things we really need to go back to basics and so we're gonna have to really slow that down and kind of work through those. We're gonna have to work in sections to clean that up because just running it over and over quickly and quickly and faster and faster is not going to clean up some of those sections. So if we can't play it with good technique at a slower tempo we're not going to be able to play it well at a faster tempo. All right, so I caught it here. You can see that overarching reach that is just awkward in that playing. And so even though this is something that she has learned and memorized, it would be really helpful to kind of break that apart in sections again, work hands alone, work through those phrases to really clean that up and really iron out some of those fingerings and hand techniques and all of the technique of just playing and feeling more in control of your playing. All right, so we have some overextension up here and Although it is a keyboard you can hear her fingernails clicking which is Difficult to listen to Her Her hands have a lot of tension in them and so just like taking that second to kind of relax and And think through what you're gonna play would be really helpful Alright, so through this section Again, you can kind of sense the frustration in and the frustration It comes from memory loss of not being able to remember the piece, but then that in turn affects You know the abrasiveness and that the harshness that she is playing the piano She gets a lot of tension in her fingers here. You can see her tendons kind of popping up in her hand and It so much of that could be alleviated by having that sheet music and being able to look at that But it be by not remembering what she's playing it creates a whole gamut of bad habits that are Perhaps not regular for her as an instrumentalist So throughout the section with that repeated pattern over and over again, that's just telling me that she doesn't remember it And so having the music would be very helpful You can see here that awkward right hand second finger position It's strained She's still reaching a bit here. And so Curling those fingers up it appears that her nails are a bit long and that is perhaps why she doesn't have that nice curved round position Okay, so again, hand position, getting music out, readjusting your body position, all those things will help in your playing. Alright throughout this section the pianist has decent body posture her Hands have a bit of tension throughout them It Appears that she may be uncomfortable playing on a keyboard versus a real piano However her like as she's releasing her hand here We want to feel that release from the wrist and we don't want to have the whole hand Be lifting it gives us it doesn't give us a solid sense of phrasing throughout our left hand we're really Pounding down through those and so our fingers are long and extended and we want to make sure that we have that good rounded hand position and that helps us to stay really even and steady in our in our quick notes She has some nice phrasing that she's going through, but again, that like we have to look at the basics in the That basic technique in or lack thereof as we're looking at things because when we have those flat fingers it it disrupts a lot of the playing and You know like the it's this is a lovely piece But to take it to that next level we really need to execute those basics more consistently Alright, this has a much slower tempo, but you can see her hands here. We still have that Really long fingers. You can see here Her fingernails are very long and so we when we're playing the piano We want really short fingernails because we want to play more of a hammer action and that allows us to have that even setting tempo I do think at this point she's a little too far away from the piano So by scooting forward a bit, it's gonna give her She's gonna feel more in control All right, so just overall rough and harsh and it's actually evident that she enjoys playing this piece and because it's frustrating to her that she's not executing it well but we have some basic deficiencies in technique that are prohibiting her from being successful even I imagine with sheet music in front of her. Again, it's very hasty. It is evident that she's had this memorized before, but at this stage, with memory and recall and sloppy phrasing, it would make more sense to slow it down and bring that sheet music back out. Okay, so as she, again, it's futile to kind of play through some of these things that there's no music for. So it's clear that she has had some training and she has memorized some of those pieces, but at this point it is, it's difficult to listen to because there's no fluidity, there's no consistency of the piece that she's attempting to execute. All right, so we kind of have some awkward left hand arpeggios there as they're reaching up and down and so I would take a little bit of time to isolate that and really clean that up The right hand is very abrasive as it's playing that main theme and so just kind of lightening up again We want to lift from the wrist so that we can throughout those phrases that we just have a more kind of delicate Even though it is a bit more It is stronger throughout that section we we want to have that delicate interpretation Okay, so again, as there becomes more memory issues, there becomes more severe technique deficiencies. And so, fundamentally, we need music in order to play through these examples. It also, when keeping in that rounded hand position, it also helps to ensure that we have all the correct notes. Maybe slowing down just slightly would help to clean up some of those passages.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Again, gets it out of the net, two hands on the basketball for better ball control, eyes and head are up, stepping through with that left foot, bringing the right leg around in his attempt at the shot. He's choosing to shoot like a little hook shot. He's a nice size post player, which that's a good shot for somebody like him. In some cases, you might want to square both shoulders and shoot the ball, but in his case, he's a big man shooting that little baby hook. He's choosing to go off two feet, nothing wrong with that. He's got great size and extension here and great angle here. The ball leaves that right hand. Those fingers are spread. Great vision and use of the backboard. Again, shooting with that left hand on the left side, great angle and use of the backboard. Again, baby hook, great snapping of the wrists, fingers are spread, great balancing body control, beautiful use of the glass and the backboard. Again, moves side to side. I love that his arm bar is up. It's not...could probably be on there a little bit longer as he transitions, but he's got great vision, ball control, stepping through with the right, lifting the left leg. Beautiful execution of the Mike and drill. Kind of steps with the right foot. You can see the left leg start to pull up. I love that his arm bar is 90 degree, protecting the ball from a defender, possibly in a game situation, his eye and head is up. He's got great spacing here and angle to use the backboard and great extension of the shooting hand as he lifts the ball on the left side for the shot. And again, he's shooting over that right shoulder, little baby hook. A lot of big men, women shoot it that way, going off two feet. But he's got great body control, great follow through, extension of the hand and the fingers, great use of the backboard. Again, would love for him to keep it up high as he transitions the ball, like get the rebound out of the net with both hands and arms up. Love that he's looking again from at the rim and the backboard as he moves from right to left. Love his footwork, stepping through with the right foot, bringing that left leg in behind. Good spacing between his feet, great spacing in relation to the backboard. Would love if he kept it up a little bit higher, but gets the rebound out of the net. Would love for him to keep it up your shoulder level. But as he transitions from left to right, his eyes and head are up. He's not having to look at the ball. He steps through with his left foot as he prepares to drag that right knee up. Two hands on the ball offers ball control as he transitions from side to side.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This is the most this is a more difficult version of the of the Mike and drill as this version of the Mike and drill is solely focused on working on the placement of the ball on the backboard and mastering the side spin mastering the usage of the side spin off of the backboard so this is again this is something that we want to make sure that we build up to and this is not a version of the Mike and drill that you show to or have a beginner work on. They have to build themselves up to this version of the Mike and drill by using the basic forms of the Mike and drill where you're jumping off one foot and extending the ball out high with one hand and then also working on the two foot version of the Mike and drill making sure you're using the proper footwork and once they understand the mastery of using the proper footwork in the Mike and drill now you can move on to different variations of the Mike and drill where you can do reverse Mike and drills off one foot, reverse Mike and drills off two foot this version right here of the Mike and drill where you're taking no steps and you're just working on and you're standing underneath the basket and you're just working solely on side spin and placement of the ball on the backboard with his left hand he hits the bottom of the left side of the rim which is something that is not uncommon for beginners to do with the first few times that they attempt this drill as it is with his weaker hand with his left hand so it's his weaker hand so it's more difficult to place the ball correctly and use the proper amount of side spin with our off hand so this attempt hits the bottom of the rim as it was more difficult because it's with his weaker hand The Mike and drill that this player is demonstrating is a higher level version of the Mike and drill where we don't take any steps and we stand directly underneath the basket. From this position, all the layups are going to be underhand scoop slash hook type shots where we work on side spin, creating good side spin on the ball so that since we're underneath the rim, it's really difficult from this position to hit the top right corner of the square. In this version of the Mike and drill, we're aiming to hit outside of the square with good side spin. Place the ball here for it to spin into the basket this way and then on this side, we're looking to hit outside of the square with good side spin with our left hand for it to spin into the basket. This version of the Mike and drill is something that players should work on as they master the basic Mike and drills like the one leg Mike and drill where you step across, jump off your left foot for the right hand finish, jump off your right foot for the left hand finish and then the two foot Mike and drills. Once they've mastered the easier versions of the Mike and drill, then that's when you come to the harder version of the Mike and drill where it's just working strictly on side spin and ball placement on the backboard so you get a feel on the proper amount of side spin that is needed according to wherever you place the ball on the backboard. On this attempt, you can see he places the ball high off the backboard, but it's in the middle section of the square. As he puts a slight amount of side spin on the ball, it's spent off of the backboard and it hit the right side of the rim and we missed the layup. On this attempt, he places the ball outside of the square and he places it nicely, nice and high on the backboard and he puts the correct amount of side spin on the ball and it's bent off the backboard and went directly into the basket.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Right now she's stepping out on her right side and swinging those arms up. And she kind of does a little like swivel snake small release in that movement. And her head is also moving, her shoulders are moving, her arms are moving. Just a really nice play. So I would suggest maybe exaggerating just a little bit more just to give a little more to this movement, but overall really nice. So, for this part when she slaps her knee, she hits the beat perfectly right on the beat and then does a really nice windmill with her arms. It's just really like seamless and just flawless as far as the movement without any breaks or stops. So from the beginning, I just noticed something different with this dancer. She was just very in tune with the music. It felt like a performance. Like I felt like this could be performance ready. Just in her demeanor, even her facial expressions, fully using her arms and extending throughout her fingertips with the really nice feet movement and just accenting all of the musical notes that you hear. Overall, this is a really, really good example for an intermediate. She was able to really show her personality, which I liked because it definitely draws in the audience. She was really comfortable with the steps, with the movements, able to use her arms fully, able to spot and hit all of her marks. A really, really nice job with this one. So here in her spin, she does a really good job at spotting. She's snapping her neck around. You can see it whipping around. If you snap, you'll like kind of feel it whip. So really nice job, a really nice smooth turns on her feet. She's not quite up on her toes right now, but she is able to spin around really nicely and smoothly. So I believe this is supposed to be more of a scoop down to the floor and around, but she did a really nice job staying with the music and really doing what was I guess able for her body at this point. So it's a nice modification to instead of swinging the arm all the way down to the floor, swinging it around front, making the movement a bit smaller but still having the same effect.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They're not quite ready to play at this tempo Maybe about five metronome clicks slower and they could get the right notes We can see here on the third finger of the left hand that that last knuckle is completely collapsed. We want to make sure that we're playing on the fingertip and not too much on the pad of the finger to prevent that knuckle from collapsing. Pianist is doing something here that we never want to see happen and that's actually resting their thumb, their first finger, on their left hand on the edge of the piano. We always want to have our fingers over the keys, even if they're not being used. This is causing this whole hand to collapse, as we can see here, causing these fingers to be completely on the pad. That's going to make it really difficult to have any control in a meaningful way over your fingers. You would just heard when the pianist was playing those thirds, they were very heavy handed, they were very loud with a slightly harsh articulation because this kind of hand positioning does not allow for sensitivity. Notice that the left hand here is much too flat. We can see that where the fingers meet the hand, right at that bottom knuckle, is actually touching the keys here. So although this is a straight wrist, and that's good, we want to raise the arm up a little bit so that the fingers are less outstretched and can hang down more from the hand. Despite being at too slow of a tempo and lacking pulse, the coordination in terms of playing at the same time between the right and left hand is good. The pianist is doing something good here when we're learning a piece of music. They now have dropped out the left hand and are just working on learning the notes on the right hand. So it's the right move to do because it's too difficult to read with hands together. Taking one hand at a time helps to get the notes at least worked out in one hand and then you can add in the others. So that's a good move. We notice that this is being played with an absence of a pulse. This is because the pianist is sight reading here, but ideally we would want to still try and pick a pulse that we can play this with while learning, but there is no pulse here.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The dancer has a little bit of a sway here with the pelvis pressing out instead of more of this happening a little bit. So the dancer would want to pull in at the belly, right in the torso to have a bit more control as well. And really extend those legs, extend those arms so the movement is clear. More energy from the dancer. More grounded, even though the knee is bent here, the knee is not bent here where the pelvis kind of comes back in, so that the dancer's more grounded and there's more movement in the hips and there's swaying and there's isolations. Not really seeing that. The dancer on that layout, you want the feet to be level with the head. The arms are out and it is the bend at knee that takes the dancer high or low, not the raising of the leg.

She's not pulling herself off her feet. She's kind of got this wide stance. It's keeping nice tension through the feet. I think for this sequence, she wants to hit left hand. And then when she has the left hand, she should be able to spring up and extend out that left foot to pinpoint this left hand pinch. And then she'll be able to bring her feet up to the start jug. So then Emilio when she kind of goes into this position, it's so bad she's still trying to be underneath it. So she's not getting any height. So she either needs to bump that right hand up to this hold, which isn't the most positive, or swap hands.

I love for these elbows to be in just a little bit here. Nice touch. This is really, really nice. Love the arc on the ball. Again, I really feel like he could jump even higher and make it more game-like by preparing. Here's his release. Pretty good extension and follow-through, guide hand. Again, we'd love for him to come down, knees bent a little bit, but he's doing a better job here of holding that follow-through. Again, beautiful release. This is really, really good. Just get that elbow in. But, you know, he's got some athleticism that he can jump, even though he's not really using his legs. He's got a little bit of a lift here. I think he could be much improved. And beautiful touch here. Here's the extension, the great follow-through. Let's get this guide hand elbow in somewhat. And I love this how the guide hand palm is facing in. Here he catches it and again, you know, his body language, I call it, it's just kind of just standing straight up. It's not as aggressive, as intense as you would like it to be. I mean, he's gonna be easily guarded here and not be able to get a shot off. Again, standing straight up, let's bend those knees, let's prepare. You know, he just kind of, when he catches it, he kind of pauses a second or two and kind of brings it down and then lowers his knee. You want it to be one quicker motion. He's just got some, you know, he hesitates, it's slow, and when that happens, you're going to be easily guarded and defended. Again, here comes the pass. Let's bend our knees, drop our hips, spread our feet. Be ready. Be a ready shooter and meet this pass. Again, nice follow-through, breaking of the wrists, get that shooting out, guide hand elbow in a little bit. It's a little bit, you want the elbow to be bent here. Here he's, it looks like he's kind of extending that guide hand. Let's keep it at 90 degree. Good lift here, good extension of the hips. I love the fact that he is reaching for the ball. He's not letting it come back and hit him in the chest. You can see he's got his hands out, which is what you want to see. And I really like this about him. It looks, you know, he's gonna backstop it with his right hand and get that guide hand on the side. He's catching it with the right so he can catch and shoot. And that's what this guide hand is here to help guide it into that shooting hand. He does turn a little sideways, turns his right hip in a little bit. Let's keep those shoulders and hips square to the basket. Pretty good follow through. We'd like it to be a little bit straighter with the elbow in under the basketball. Here the shooter again is shooting a 15-footer. Here in the ego view, you know, again, good extension here. The elbow's out just a tad, and the father's a little cross his body, but not too bad. The guide hand's on the side, but, you know, you really don't want them crossing each other. Let's get the, you know, let's let them be side by side. Let's get this elbow in so that forearm is parallel to the floor. Again, I would love for this guy to be more of a ready shooter. You know, his preparation before the shot is key for to being more, a more effective jump shooter. Nice jumper here, beautiful follow-through. Elbow, get that elbow in here, love his guide hand on the side. Starting to get a little air here under his feet, which is good. Here's the release. He really cocks this arm back. I'd get that shooting elbow in a little bit, but you know he gets the ball up high which is good and you could see it in in the ego view here. Again, here's how he prepares. A point of emphasis would be to step back, move your feet a little bit, and step into this pass. Again, this is really nice. He's got a really, really nice, I call it touch. Touch meaning extended elbow, beautiful breaking of the wrist. That guide hand is not shooting the basketball. It's doing what it's supposed to be doing. Pretty good, pretty good shot. Good looking shot here. Again, but he does, you know, pull the ball up. It might be a little bit behind his head here, but he does a great job of lifting it up for the shot. Here, he's going to extend up his legs and start to lift a little bit. I really feel like he could get more power from his legs if he would prepare a little bit, but doing a good job of getting the ball up to the height. You know, you wanted to release it as high as possible. Again, this is what I'm talking about, the readiness, the preparation to be a great shooter. It's about moving without the basketball. So even in this drill, ideally to make it game-like, which you want drills to be game-like, you know, I would really get him to step into this pass. Here comes the pass. But he's standing straight up. His knees are locked out. I would love for him to step in maybe left, right, and catch and elevate and use the strength of his legs to give him power to lift. You want to be able to jump and shoot over the defense. That's what has to happen.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This one because the climber needs to let some time to pass for the climber to gain height when on the jump. And once the center of gravity is transferred over to the highest foot, then the climber will boost the jump by pressing on the right foot. But if it's pressed early, it can throw off the climber's center of gravity from the direction that he needs to go. And as we can see, the climber was able to land the hand on the hold. This is exactly where the climber was aiming to go to since the beginning. And he, in order to sustain the grip, as we can see, this is a big jug. So it has a white lip and the climber is able to slide the fingers behind the lip of the hold and places the thumb underneath to make a pinch. So in order for the climber to sustain this placement, he will need to create friction between the skin that are the fingertips when the climber gets to curl the hand inside of the hold and also apply weight, trying to remain underneath the hold in order to sustain himself from swinging and also apply pressure at the hold. Here we can see the climber swinging left to right. This is because the climber is building momentum to commit to the jump. Once the climber is in the air, he will have to send one of the hands up to the hold. This is called a dyno. When the climber is going to be released from the wall, all of the holds having no point of contact for a very small fraction of a second to send his hand to land onto one area of the hold above. He needs to know exactly at what area he will be sending the hand to as he will need to rely on it once making the reach. if the climber was going to try this again he needs to make sure that he gains a bit more height before pressing on the right foot to boost the jump. This is because the climber was being taken away from the wall when performing on the boost of the right foot being engaged. So that's so the climber when he's going on the right direction close to the wall he needs to make sure that also he brings the chest even closer to the wall in that case to bring the hips to follow along when on the jump. The climbers force of the jump and boost with the right foot was greater than the climbers power grip. As we can see his left hand who was just placed has slipped off from the hold so the climber here will be detached and the climb will be over as he will land on the mat. Here the climber is shaking his hands and this will help the climber not only to just warm up but to also release any tension that the climber has had built up on his hands from previously climbing. Here the climber was able to send the left hand to match on the dyno hold. In this case the climber is sustaining to a jug. As we can see the climber is able to wrap the hands around the edge of the hold and he sends the both of the hands to secure the grip. This because the climber center of gravity is being driven away from the wall while on the swing. As we can see the climber keeps the feet up so he's not able to touch the ground. Since the climber is continuing to go out it's important that he keeps a very tight grip. However if he continues to go out the force of the pull will be going in the contrary of where he's supposed to be under the hold in order to sustain pressure. So this is a matter of the climber sustaining a good grip in order to not slip off the hold. As the climber gains height on the jump, we can see that the climber had pressed hard first on the left toe. This one was placed against the wall so the climber can then aim for direction to remain underneath the hold when being pushed. Now that the climber is with the chest parallel where his grips are, the climber will have to from here engage in a forceful pull up to bring his chest close to the wall. That way when the climber is going out on the leap, the climber is able to stay close to the wall when on the jump. Here the climber is starting at a two hand hold start meaning that both of the hands have their own hold and the two type of holds they are called donuts because the climber needs to place both of the hands inside the hole of the hold and in this one he uses the bottom area of the donut. The left hand is slightly different to the right hand being more positive. The left hand is more flat on the inside so the climber will need to curl the fingertips only behind that small groove and contrary to the right hand we can see how the groove is more open so the climber has a more positive grip onto the right hand and applies thumbs in the outside to apply grip power by pressing on the hold. Now the climber in order to apply pressure onto the grips he leans back on the holds and the climber to get started on the climb he will need to place the feet onto the wall as we can see the left foot is applied against the wall and the right toe is applied onto a hold that he is placing right now. He's entire front toe box of the sole meeting the surface of the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Again, I would encourage these dancers to continue to practice because they're not clapping on the rhythm and that is an extremely important skill to be able to have for this basic choreography and to demonstrate it with efficiency. More practice is needed for this entire section to make sure that it's moving, the dancer's moving with precision, but also they are staying on the beat. So practicing that while making sure when you practice, you engage your core and you are in a deep plie will improve the overall quality of this movement, but also making sure that they'll be able to execute it efficiently. I'll repeat my previous comment about releasing tension in the hands. I would encourage the dancer to really think about making sure that they're on the rhythm and embodying this musicality and having this steady buoyancy through the balls of the feet that reverberates through the entire body while they're beginning this basic choreography. The dancer has this great buoyancy, but notice how they are coming all the way up and then bending all the way down. They should bend really far up, far down, and then they should come only up about halfway. So they're constantly in plie. It's just are you in a deep plie or are you in a kind of a light plie, right? Having that kind of small bounce and small buoyancy will allow them to move efficiently and maintain a great range of motion throughout instead of wasting energy going all the way up to straight legs and then back down to plie, which again would help with the agility and efficiency of the overall dance. Notice how the dancer is holding tension throughout their fingertips and their hands in kind of these awkward positions So I would encourage them to let go And shake their hands out and let make make sure that the energy doesn't stop at their fingers at their wrists But it goes all the way out to their fingertips So it doesn't look as awkward or stiff This is a nice attempt from the dancer. I would encourage them to improve this movement to have more hustle and attack and really move faster and they can do that by engaging their core and really pli\u00e9ing and bending their legs even further so they have a greater range of motion to move from but they also have core and center control to be able to move quickly and efficiently and with precision.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Again, player utilizing incorrect technical action in terms of rolling his right foot from the inside over the ball. So surface of the foot is using a lot of the bottom part of the foot. So when we're using the sole of the foot, we want to really utilize the balls of the feet. So a soft light touch so we're not fully planting our foot on the ball, losing balance and control. We can also see that the player's not really moving his left foot as he's utilizing this specific technique. So as he's rolling the foot over the ball and away, the stance of the player becomes wider so then we lose elements of balance, control, and lose the ability to now move the ball and change direction and travel wherever we want to go at speed. Body position, very upright and high, so any dribbling action, turn, skill we're going to utilize, we're always going to want to look for the player to be low to the ground, bending the knees, low hips, body moving in the direction we want the ball to go. A player again is dribbling action, he is more shuffling the ball with the inside of his feet than necessarily dribbling. When we're dribbling we want to keep the ball close, small touches, but we want to be moving in a fluent action on the balls of our feet. If we're going to change direction with the inside of the foot it will be a purposeful change. If we're going to dribble we want to utilise the laces where we try and get our toe down heel up. As you can see again the player is again straight legs, upright body position, so we're going to get lower to the ground, bend his knees, lower his hips, lower central gravity, better balance, better control, getting his body leaning towards where the ball is going to go with a set outcome and a technical choice made. Again, the player is just utilizing the sole of the right foot to roll it from the inside to the outside. Again this is going to move the ball away from the body, not moving his body with the ball and obviously as we roll that right foot across the ball, we're now going to be in a more extended stance which is going to lose balance, lose control, lose the ability to change direction and speed. So if the left foot was moving with the right foot then maybe it's a technique that the player is used to using but not the technical choice I would expect the player to utilize at his level especially or any player because we're placing that right foot now in the way of the ball, we're not really moving with the ball, our body is in a very upright position so we want to try and bend these knees, hips up, we want to make the correct technical choice based on where we're looking to go and the direction that we want to travel with. Player changing the direction with the inside of the right foot so the ball is coming across and his next touch is going to take him forward. So the player here as the ball is travelling from left to right we can see if foot position heel up, toe slightly down, making contact with the side of the ball but if our toe is pointing down to the ground then we're not making contact with the middle of the ball and having full control. We can also see the player with a straight leg reaching for the ball so that's going to lead to a lack of balance, lack of control as we change direction. Ideally we want to be moving our feet across and if we're going to utilise our right leg to change direction we want to see a slight knee bend, toe curled slightly up through the middle of the ball so we can really change direction and push off with the left leg in a position where we can move quickly. We can also see the player's body position is facing to the right. As we're making contact with the ball to come this way we already want to see our body starting to turn and move in the direction with the ball so we can effectively change direction with speed and with balance. Just general dribbling action for the player. Ideally we want to be dribbling if we're moving in a straight line, dribbling with the laces. So we're moving in a more fluent running technique. If obviously we're trying to push the ball forward, turning our left foot out to the side, it's going to affect our ability to travel with the ball at speed. If we're going to utilize the inside of the foot, then we want to make sure that we are utilizing as much of the inside curvature of the foot with the middle of the ball as possible. With the contact with the big toe area here, you can see the contact between the ball and the foot is minimal, so we're going to have less control and movement with the ball. If we can dribble with our laces, toe down, heel down, it's going to allow us to get our knee over the ball, bend our knees, get our low body position, and we want to try and bring our body forward in the direction that we want the ball to go, not be in this upright position which limits our balance, control, and ability to change direction at speed. Play again executing a little sole roll technique to move the ball from right to left. You can see here the player looks like he's using a little bit close to the balls of the feet but still a big surface connected to the ball. We want to try and make sure that as we're rolling the ball across our body that we're in a position where it's a light soft touch and we can move that foot then in behind the line of the ball to allow it to roll. You can see the player is starting to move his body to the left which is positive. So as he's moving the ball across we want his left leg to be moving behind the line of the ball for the next action. Again, utilizing the sole of the foot to move the ball from inside of his body to out. Again, sole of the foot, we want to use the balls of the feet, not the full bottom surface of the foot. The player here is rolling the ball from the inside of the ball to the outside of the ball, which is a very complicated technique. And I'd say at the player's level, not the correct technique for this player. We see the left foot planted very firmly to the ground, rooted through that standing foot. So as he rolls the right foot across the ball, he's now going to extend his stance, which is going to lead to the player's ability to lose balance and not be able to change direction quickly with the ball. So we want to make sure that we're utilizing the correct technical action in the specific moment that the player is looking to change direction and dribble with. Again, just following up with the technique choice to roll the right foot from the inside to the outside of the ball. So rolling it this way, you can see for the player to regain balance effectively, he's now moving his right leg further outside the line of the ball, he's keeping his left foot planted to the ground, so he's not even moving his left foot with the ball. So now we end up with this extended stance. So with the feet so far apart, the feet planted to the ground, the body obviously still leaning left as the ball's going right, we're off balance, we're not able to move with the ball, change direction with the ball effectively, maintain our balance or develop any speed or quality in the dribbling action. Player again looking to utilise the sole of the foot to roll the foot from the inside to the outside. The change here to some of the prior actions, as you can see the left foot is not fully planted to the ground so as he's rolling the ball across the player's body is at least moving with it so he's not extending this stance. So he's rolling the ball out, body is moving slightly with it but we're still in a somewhat upright stance so our ability to balance, control the ball, change direction effectively is slowed down. Unwaith eto, mae'r chwaraewr yn defnyddio'r s\u00f4l ei chwaith i'w mynd i'r b\u00eal, felly yn ei r\u00f4l o mewn i'r ffwrdd.

Felly nid oes gennym dyluniadau o gyfathrebu ar ein byd, cyfathrebu ar y b\u00eal, o ran, Pa ffordd y byddwn yn mynd, lle y byddwn yn mynd i newid y ffordd i gael cyfathrebu, cyflym a chyhoeddi. Player here just doing a little Cruyff type skill, but again we can see player not very well balanced with his body position, very upright. If we're going to utilize the Cruyff turn, we want to be much lower to the ground, just like any dribbling action, bend our right knee, bend our left knee as we're turning our right foot inside to make contact with the front of the ball. We want to see the body nice and low, hips lower, body starting to turn towards the direction that we want to go, so as that ball comes out of our feet we can move onto the ball. Player being in a very upright position, very difficult for the player to maintain balance, control, change direction with speed. Player utilizing the sole of the foot to change the direction of the ball. Generally if we're looking to move the ball to the right hand side we're going to want to utilize the outer laces part of the foot or the left foot to change direction. If we're rolling our right foot from the inside of the ball to the outside over the top of it our foot's naturally going to be planted in the way of the ball. It's going to make it more difficult for us to regain our balance and change direction the way that we want to go with speed. So the selection of the technique is not the desired one and it's going to lead to the player slowing down, not having maximum balance or having the ability to change direction at speed and under control. Again, just finishing off the action as the player finishes rolling his right foot over the ball. We can see now he's looking to regain his balance, has to plant his right foot in the ground. Ball is really stuck under his feet. We always want to try and keep the ball out in front of us so we can move with it. Again this extended stance means the player is off balance. So if we don't have balance we can't move with the ball. Be upright and not really able to move anywhere with the ball fluently. The player is demonstrating a little sole roll skill with his right foot to bring the ball across his body from right to left. We'll see the player relatively flat footed, so we want to remain on the balls of our feet. When dragging the ball with the right foot, we want to make sure we're utilising the balls of our feet, not the full flat surface of the foot. This is going to impact our balance, our movement, our ability to control and move with the ball at speed. The action to move from the right top of the ball to the left is fine, but obviously a lot of contact between the front of the ball, which is going to impact the quality and control of the skill itself. Body position, relatively upright, so we want to make sure that as we're changing direction, our body is moving with it, trying to keep as low to the ground as we can with low hips, bending our knees so our centre of gravity is lower, better balance, better control. We can see the player changing direction, so the player has executed a little step over but now as the player is looking to change direction, so coming from there and coming around we can see the player looking to utilise the inside of the right foot to freeze the ball, stop the ball. We can see that he's more planting his foot to the ground to stop the ball from rolling rather than making contact with the ball to change direction. We can see again in a very upright position, we want our knees to be bent, hips low, body turning so as this right foot is turning to hit the ball or to make contact with the ball we fully expect these hips to be turning, the body to be turning as he's making contact with the ball so he can now change direction with more fluency and more speed. Right now his body is obviously twisting to face forward as he's making contact with the ball so now we're going to stop the ball but now we're going to have to take more time, more steps, more touches to change the direction of the ball and maintain a fluent dribbling action. Player dribbling with the inside of the left foot, slightly better position with the inside of the foot and the knee. So if we're gonna travel in this direction, we wanna make sure that we're trying to get our knee over the ball and leaning towards the direction we wanna go. This is gonna help in terms of our body position, turning to go where we wanna go. Player not in necessarily full balance and control. We can see his right foot, still pretty planted to the ground and away from where he wants to go. So ideally, if we're gonna go with this left foot on the inside, we wanna be on the balls of our feet, bend this right knee, get our hips low to the ground so we can dribble and effectively move with the ball in the same moment that we've been making contact with. And we see here the end of the action, the ball doesn't really travel out of our feet, so the contact with the ball, the balance of the player. When we're changing direction, we want to be able to move the ball out of our feet so we can move onto it, not keep the ball close to our feet. You can see how far underneath the body the ball is, so it's going to make it additionally difficult for the player to move at speed, separate from defenders and create space for himself. The player just dribbling from a forward direction, looking to stop the ball as he's looking to move the ball back inside the area. It's important when we're looking to stop the ball, we're not planting our full foot on top of the ball. That's going to affect our balance, our ability to manipulate the ball. We want to utilize the balls of the feet on the top of the ball to be able to stop it, to change the direction of the ball and move it. You can see as the player is slowing down to stop the ball. Again, the player is in a very upright position, so when he changes direction and looks to move with the ball, it's going to make it harder for him to change direction with balance and speed. So, we want to try and stop the ball when the ball is out in front of us. Bend this left knee, get our hips lower, body in a position where we're able to stop the ball, pull the ball back or change direction with the ball. And player in a drilling action with the right foot. We can see here the player just looking to regain control, straight leg, turning his right toe inside to make contact with the front half of the ball. So obviously if we have full control of the ball, we wanna try and make sure that we are running with the ball where our knees are bent, our body position is lower, body leaning with the ball. And if we're gonna change direction to come to the right, is then we'll get our knee further forward over the ball, leaning in the direction we wanna go. But here, obviously the player losing elements of control, the distance between the left foot and the right foot, the body position, the contact with the ball, the player not really matching an outcome with a technical choice. So you see the player allows the ball to travel across the front of his body by bringing the right foot that rolls the ball behind the line of the ball, which is good, and then brings his left foot around the back. We can see as he's getting into this finishing position, again, very upright, straight leg to receive the ball, high hips, high back right, pretty flat footed with the right foot as it lands to the ground. So we lose elements of our balance, control, ability to change direction and have that balance and control to move with the ball.

This is unfortunately pretty common with some of these cross under moves where you have to be very careful not to bump the higher arm off. One of the ways around this is to just cross over instead of under. That actually can push the dominant arm into the hold even further, but here the climber just makes the mistake of bumping their hand off of the hold that they're on. We have the climber one move in on this boulder. They're matched on what was the right hand start hold. Started in a hand foot match where their left hand was down here and they brought their left foot up. So they're into the boulder and progressing up the wall. The climber then comes up to this green pinch, kind of deliberates whether they want to go right foot or left foot on this hold. And that is essentially them deciding whether or not they want to go right hand or left hand into this purple hold. They decide to bump past the green hold and go left hand up to the purple pinch.

Her arms should be straightened right here. Her left arm is bent. Her arms should be out completely linear in a straight line with energy radiating from her fingertips. The dancer should end this turn facing completely forward. Right now, her sternum and her chest is facing towards the left side of the room. Her eyes are also facing towards the left side of the room. She should be twisting her body forward and this should be inclusive of her shoulders, her chest, her hips, her waist, her knees. Everything should be facing forward. The dancer takes very small steps here when she's moving horizontally to her left. She should be taking larger steps and covering more ground. The dancer's right foot also should be lifted off the ground. So her right leg should be angled further away from her body and off the ground. To be able to do that better, she could also bend her left knee more so that her body is lower to the ground and then her right leg in an oppositional force should be pulling away from the center of her body. Also, a way in which that could help her get lower to the ground is if she widened her legs more, and that would mean her bringing her left foot further away towards the left side of the room, so that her feet instead would be wider apart. By that I mean the dancer should be lower to the ground. She needs to bend her knees so that she's lowered. Her head is still at a high level of really, her head should be lower because as a result of her knees bending. The dancer should not start this routine looking to the side, perhaps at her instructor in the mirror view. She should start the routine looking straight forward, which is where she should be looking when she is dancing. So even though the routine hasn't started, she already should be focused with her spine turned straight forward. Right now she is twisting her cervical spine, which is her neck, to the side. So it's already starting, not in a place of complete focus. The dancer does not execute this step completely here. She is rushing through it and does it do it to the extreme level which she should. The dancer steps leading with her heel first on these horizontal steps towards her left. She should not be stepping on her heel, she actually should be stepping on her toe first instead. The dancer needs to relax her face. She is making an O shape with her lips here and it's just not complete relaxation so she needs to be more confident in herself in the execution of the routine which would show in her face. This facial expression is not the one that she should be making here.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here the climber has made the move up to the next hold and has sent the hand palming over what's a look like a slight diagonal pinch. Now the climber is not holding on to this hold necessarily the right way so that is the reason why the climber is having a hard time to grabbing onto the hold and to do this the climber needs to release some pressure from the hand above to readjust it so the climber at this time is pushing down hard and sending up onto that heel hook as well as pulling and bringing into a hard pull up to release the pressure from the hand. At the same time we can see how the flagging out as a climber gains leverage the leg is being dropped with this toe pointing down. Here it's good of the climber to always be glancing over to the feet. Especially in this position, the climber feels not at a great stance, so needs to extend the stance. In this case, the climber glances down and what he's doing is doing a foot hop where he will hop the left foot out while bringing the right foot into the same foot chip. The foot chip is very small, so the climber must engage the upper body in order to release some pressure down at the feet. And without losing the feet in the slip, then the climber quickly needs to do this in control to release the left foot and let the right foot come into place. Here we can see the climber quickly moving over to the left side as soon as he places the right foot against the wall. This foot is not in any foot chips but instead is used to be extended out and the climber is pushing towards the wall to help the climber extend over to the left side. Once the climber extends the leg the climber will be able to stand up and over the foot that is being placed to gain leverage. Here the climber spent already so much time with going up to the reach on the hold before and then knowing that he couldn't make the hand adjustment he goes for the next hold on route. This one is called bumping up when the same hand has already gone up once and is going for a second time up to the next hold. Here we can see the climber fully standing on the heel hook that was in height placement. As we can see the climber has folded the leg because it will help the climber to create more pressure and stability while in the heel hook position. And the left leg when pointing out right and is extended at this moment which is performing a back flagging because it's folded behind the right leg. The leg that is extended being the left leg is right now used for balance as the climber needs to lean back on the hold that's been supported. So the right side at this moment, the right hand and the right foot is the one that is the base of support. In the back flag which is the left leg being out behind it is sent out for stability so that the climber can bring his center of gravity as close as he can to the base of support. Here we can see the climber has swept feet down below and brought the right foot into a higher stance. This one by placing the heel in on top of the hold first rather than the toe. This is called a heel hook and heel hooks are known to be really strong as it can does as it can do a motion of pulling and almost used as a third hand. Since the climber will be able to push down on the heel and pull towards the climber this is considered to be really strong as is using the thigh muscle during its use. Here we can see the climber chucking up his hands. This will help the climber to have a better grip when on the wall, as well as absorbing any sweat that may be coming from his hands. Here the body position that the climber is on is on the left leg being extended. It's called flagging out. Now the climber will be gaining reach and by stepping up on the right toe. The right toe right now is placed on a foot chip and as we can see the climber has brought the right leg to be pointing out left. This one the knee pointing out left and this will help the climber to keep the right side close to the wall since the right hand is the one going out for the reach and supported to bring his center of gravity close to the wall is the leg that's on flag where he will be using the toe to tap against the wall to support bringing the hips close to the wall when making the stance. Here we can see the climber having difficulties when reaching out left. This is due to the knee being on the way of when he's crunching up to make the reach out left being a pinch. Now this situation of having high foot placement is good for the climber to think to keep it in place when making the next move as well. Not only going for the first move out of the starting hold. But even though he's having a hard time with bringing himself close to the wall due to the leg being in front of him is due to his height. And it's something that the climber then would have to push through by making a pull up position and really engaging into a hard pull up in order to reach out left. While the right foot was being extended and tapping against the wall to bring himself over to the left side. Here we can see the climber starting with a one hold start, meaning that both hands will be placed in the same hold. In this case the climber does by positioning the hands crossed. The top one will be the one that it will be moving out next as the climber glances over to the left. He's positioned the right hand to be closer to the other hold that is at reach, which is a choice of the climber when thinking about the body movement. We can see how the climber also has brought up the left foot in a higher placement and it's already pressing on the hold. However the climber yet to start since it's touching the ground with the right foot. Once the right foot is placed on the wall then the climber starts and then the climber will be able to come off from the starting hold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It's important that the climber glances over to about like one, two, three moves ahead before performing a move. This is called reading the sequence and if the climber has sent the wrong hand over to the hold that she had sent then the climber will have to spend some time and energy to be repositioned. That's why it's important to before starting to climb to glance over and make a plan. It's important the climber always glances down when making a new foot placement. On this one the climber after pressing into the right toe and raising the hips had transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. Now the left foot is the one that is being pressed so the climber while sustaining the grips brings the right foot at a higher stance. If the climber was to perform this again, it's important that she plans from the ground before getting onto the wall the moves that she will need to perform. However, sometimes the climber might encounter themselves in the moves that they wanted to perform and it seems to not feel good. And so down climbing is an option, but the climber needs to do this with control, especially if it's a move that was dynamic, it'll be much harder to down climb. The climber is starting at a one-hold start where both hands are in the same hold. This is called matching and the type of hold she is sustaining to is a large one with a lip where the climber can wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold being a positive grip. Now the climber is placing the right foot onto a large foothold and when the climber is placing the other foot then she will no longer be standing on the mat. Then the climb will start. The climber was retracting the move that she had just performed and this is called down climbing. However the climber did not get to position the left foot towards the wall to control her detachment of the left hand that was out at reach. This one because the climber will go out in a swing and having only one foot placed onto the wall would have been very difficult to sustain her swing reason why the climber had landed onto the mat. The climber after making the right toe placement onto the foothold, we can see how she had brought the right knee to come inwards. This is so that she was able to keep her right side of the body close to the wall as the direction that the climber needs to sustain the hold above. She would need to lay back underneath the hold and towards the right side. Due to the climber wanting to stay close to the wall to manage the center of gravity, to stay close, she has released the left foot to transfer the weight to the right foot being in place. The climbers next move is at reach and sends the left hand to land the grip over to the left side of the hold. Now because the climbing is sending the left hand over the right arm this is called a crossover move and the climber was also able to extend the left side of the body by pressing down onto the right foot to raise the hips.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I would encourage the dancer to be more grounded by sinking into their plie and pushing their hips further back. This will create more range of motion and again more fluidity throughout the movement. I would encourage a dancer to take bigger steps and to make sure that they're grounded through their plie. Here I'll repeat my previous comments about incorporating the shoulders and the upper body torso into the arm movement as an extension of the arm movement, rather than just moving their arms, which can oftentimes look awkward. I would encourage the dancer to rotate their shoulders while they're moving their arms to create more fluidity in the movement. This is important because it adds to the overall style and texture of the dance.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She needs to be wider on with her foot stance. She needs to shoot with 1 instead of 2. And then I think she only made 1 by banking it, so I'd put her at a 2.

And one good thing about this is they were originally hanging on with their right hand and then we can see that they switched their feet so their left foot is on the wall now with a right foot flagging out to the right. And then one final thing that they did right before bringing in that left hand is they really made sure to kind of sit down on their arm and bring their bodyweight directly underneath their handhold. And this further reinforces that they're placing a lot of their bodyweight on their legs which is always a good thing to see to help conserve your energy. And then that way they're not having to pull or engage with their upper body which does use up a lot of energy very quickly. And here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bumping the right hand into the next handhold here. So they are in basically identical position of hanging on with the left hand here as well as utilizing this right foot here. So one thing that we can see about this movement here is that as the climber reached for that right hand we can kind of see that the body started to sit away from their movements and this kind of shows to me that they weren't really trusting so much what was going on with their right foot because what they should have done is really encouraged how much transition they were getting on their right foot by continuing to bring their right knee over the right foot and this will help guide the rest of the body to the handhold. But what we can see is that as the climber was making this move it seems as if the climber was completely relying on the right hand getting onto that handhold to make sure that they didn't fall or you know that they were able to complete the move. So I would definitely encourage the climber to really transition more of their body weight over that right foot to help this movement a little bit more. And then here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing their left hand up into the next handhold here. And in this position we can see that they're hanging on with a right hand here, as well as utilizing a left foot directly underneath their hand. So because they're using opposite points of contact with each other and they are in a stacked position, kind of on top of each other, this does naturally allow the climber to really rotate and pivot around those two points. So what we can see the climber doing is they're rotating their body so the left side of the body is getting closer to the wall. And this helps to get them closer with that left hand to make this movement a little bit easier. And then on top of that we can see that the climber is utilizing a right flagging foot. And this helps to push and press off the wall so then that way they can continue further that rotation that they're doing. And again, like I've been mentioning, it helps to really distribute all of their body weight on their left foot. So then that way they can help prevent any foot slipping from occurring. Just because more of the body is placed on it so there's more friction on that and it reduces the amount of slipping that can occur. And so here we can see that after the clamor was able to match that left hand, they're now bringing over the right hand into the final handhold here. And in this position, we can see that they're hanging on with that left hand there, and they do have a pretty high right foot. One thing that I'm noticing about this move is that as they're transitioning over to the right, we can see that the left foot was pretty high, and now they're allowing it to kind of flag down into the right. So it's by allowing that left foot to kind of naturally flag and hang down underneath them, it's actually helping to provide them with the momentum that they need to hang on to their holds, and so they can comfortably reach over into that right handhold. So this is kind of a good natural position to see from the climber, just because we can kind of see that they're placing a lot of body weight on their right foot, and they're allowing their natural momentum to take place, so they can kind of guide themselves in the direction they need to go. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing their right hand over into this orange hold here. And we can see that the climber worked their hand all the way around to the right side of the handhold, which is the best part of the handhold. So it's very smart of the climber to really utilize the best part of the handhold, because we can see that they're kind of wrapping around the corner of the hold right there, which helps them to really engage the handhold. And in this position, we can see the climber was able to use a left hand, and then they were using a really low right foot here, and then they also were able to use a left foot. So I kind of like the way that they utilize their position here, because with that high left foot, it helped to really push their body weight over to the right to ensure that they could reach over to that right handhold. The only thing I don't really like so much is how low the right foot is in this position, because we can see that the leg is basically in a full extension right here. And by getting their legs in a full extension there, they're no longer placing too much body weight on their leg, and they're completely putting more body weight on their upper body, because we can see that their left arm, they're having to pull on it a little bit more. And I would kind of argue that if that right foot slipped off the wall, it would cause their right arm to go into flexion, so then that way they can prevent any swinging from occurring. So I would always encourage climbers to really make sure they pay attention to how long some of these moves might be for them. And I would actually encourage to place their feet in a higher position before committing to hand moves to prevent extended positions like this that could result in a foot slipping. So here we can see the climber was able to make the first move of bringing the right hand over into the next handhold here. I mean the way the climber was able to do that was by hanging on with the left hand here and then in the starting position we did see that the climber placed a left foot as well as a right foot kind of below both together really close and so as the climber was able to make the next move of bringing the right hand over we could see that the right foot kind of just slipped off the wall so it's kind of now hanging off of the wall right here so the climber was forced to only be able to place their body weight on their left foot. So one thing I would always encourage climbers especially kind of in any movement was to really allow themselves to fully weight at least one foot on the wall and that I would always encourage to flag the other foot and by flagging the foot it helps to coordinate their body so that they can further place their body weight on the one foot that's making contact with the wall and in this way that also allows them to rotate and pivot around that singular foot. So what probably ended up happening is as the climber reached up for the right hand they try to turn their body around the two feet that they have because we could see that their right side of their body kind of rotated closer to the wall here and as they pivoted and turned in that direction that caused the right foot to come off the foothold that it was on so it's always a sudden shift or sudden loss of a foot that could cause an increased body weight especially on their hands I mean could result in a fall so I would always encourage climbers to try and focus on placing their feet on one foot on the wall and then flagging with the other to try and prevent that foot slipping from occurring. And then here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing their left hand right into this position here. And then what we can see is they were hanging on with their right hand and they were able to switch their feet so they now have a left foot on the wall. So again we do see opposite points of contact with the wall which is a really important thing right here. And then because both their points are stacked on top of each other, the climber needs to make sure they utilize their proper flagging foot to really control their balance. So we can see that their flagging foot is going down and to the right. So with this flagging foot it helps to place a little bit of their body weight over to the right which actually prevents any swinging going on over into the rightward direction. So we can see that the climber is doing a really good job of making sure that they're not swinging or preventing any swinging from occurring. And then another good thing to see is that we can see that their arms are in a pretty straight position which shows to me that they're really relying on their legs to do a lot of the work and they're not really trying to pull into this position which could use a lot of energy very quickly. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing the right hand up into the next handhold here. So in that position we can see the climber was hanging on with the left hand as well as utilizing a high right foot. And then again their left foot is in a flagging position right here. So again because they're using left hand and right foot which are opposite points of contact with each other, this allows them to have really good control between those two points just because their body is centered between those two points. And one good thing about this position again is we can see with that flagging foot it's helping to really distribute a lot of their body weight on top of that right foot. So they can really control what's going on with it. So in the movement we could see that the climber was doing a good job of transitioning their body weight over that right foot by guiding that right knee over and along the foot. And to make sure that the knee is kind of parallel to the wall as opposed to pointing straight into the wall. Because if they pointed it straight into the wall it would make it hard for them to really transition over to the right. So the key is allowing their hips to be open and making sure that their right knee is parallel to the wall as they continue this movement. And so here again, we can kind of see in the first person image that both feet are now hanging off the wall And again that kind of happened just because the climber did experience a right foot kind of slipping off the foothold Because originally they did have a right foot somewhere around in this area and they did also have a left foot out and to the left and it did look like the climber was ready getting ready to move into the next handhold and As they did that the right foot again slipped off of the foothold So then again this kind of shows to me that the climber isn't really Distributing their body weight appropriately as much as they need to be to prevent their feet from slipping off the wall Because again by allowing the feet to slip off the wall it immediately places a lot of extra body weight on their hands So we can see that as the climbers now has both feet off the wall They're being forced to completely hang on their hands. And again, this can make them very tired very quickly So I'd always encourage climbers to really make sure they pay attention to where the feet are being placed and how their body weight is being Distributed on it", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I love the fact that he's got two hands on the ball as he prepares to pull the ball up to shoot it. Again, pretty good spacing here. Eyes and head are up watching the target. Again, kind of shoots it over his right shoulder. Would love for him to be more squared up. Again, I love how the balls lifted up high onto the backboard.

I would love to see him square that right shoulder up a little bit and use that dribble to really lift and elevate on the shot. On this actual release, I wish he could have his hips squared up a little bit more to the basket. He's kind of shooting over that right shoulder, if you will. I think he would be more successful if he faced both shoulders and maybe turned that right hip in a little bit. He's kind of angled here, not really squared up, if you will. But love the extension of the elbow and the follow-through to the rim. We'd love to see him be a little bit more aggressive into this movement. I feel like he could get more lift if he had a really more powerful dribble that leads him into this shot, more of a deliberate dribble out in front of him that leads him into this shot.

Now the only place of contact is his foot, so the climber right now is making his way down to the ground. The climber is starting at a one-hold start. Both of the hands placed in the same hold, this is called matching. And the climber is holding the same way for both of the hands due to the type of block that the climber is holding onto. Where the climber must press the hold as a clamp in a pinch position. So, in order for the climber to generate pressure on the grips, he presses on the thumbs down below. And then the climber, once he obtains pressure on the grip, he's able to lean back. As the climber is starting on the first position, the climb will start until the feet are positioned on the wall. The climber is applying chalk onto the hold. He spreads it out on the hold because over time the holds may lose its chalk and will make it difficult for the climber to grip it on. If the climber was going to hold onto it, especially if the chalk is not there, it will become slippery. So reapplying the chalk is good for the climber to gain a better grip. Now that the climber has gotten himself positioned on the first stance, he brings his right leg to be extended. This is called flagging, which the climber will keep extended and eventually tap the toe against the wall when necessary if he needs to keep a position and form. The flagging will help the climber to keep his position square and also helps to transfer over the weight to the highest foot, being the one in position. When the climber is ready, he will engage into a forceful pull up up to the next hold. Here we can see the climber shaking his hands. This will help the climber release any tension that has been built up, especially if he has already attempted the wall, but it also helps with warming up the hands before starting to climb.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

However, they're on positive enough holds that it doesn't negatively affect them too much. They're still able to complete the problem. So while it took a lot of readjustment for the climber to make that match on the left hand hold, it was worth it because it allowed them to get their right foot up, and that posts them in a really good position to make this long right hand reach. Because now their foot is already in position to make the next move. Climbers are really struggling to establish on the finishing hold and both beta styles they attempted would work. They heal their toe hook out right if they really pull in with that hamstring. It creates enough balance that they can just touch with the right hand. Alternatively, if they put the left foot in the middle of the hold that they're on right now and sack their body weight really low, so they should be aiming hips underneath in this line, they can just stay into a static position and touch it. Good control on the undercling. Climber has their left hand position on this undercling pocket by pressing off the left foot and really driving the momentum from there.

It'd be helpful for them to bring up their arm a little bit around so they can play with their fingertips. This would allow each note to be more clear, but it would also give a more comfortable hand shape that they could play each individual note more in tune so that the chord sounds in tune. Again, this is another example that this chord could be much more clear if they played more with their fingertips instead of the flat of their finger. As the violinist is going up the scale and playing up in the higher positions, they're focusing a lot on their left hand and so they're starting to not use the full amount of bow. This is resulting in them starting to rush. No matter where they are in the fingerboard, they should make sure that they're always maintaining the pattern that they're using in the bow and keeping an even tempo. The violinist is doing a nice job of bringing in their upper arm to help them play more at the frog. Because of this, they're able to use their full bow, which is helping maximize their sound. The violinist is starting to increase their tempo. It would be good for them to practice these scales with a metronome so they can play with a steady tempo. The violinist is playing two strings at the same time now to play this chord. Bounce is playing this note with a flat finger. They're still getting the note to sound, but it'd be sound so much more clear if they were able to play with their fingertip. If they were to help bring their arm a little bit further out, their elbow out, they could help have a little bit more of a curved hand. This would give them more clarity. When playing this scale, the bow speed that they're using is not always constant. They always spend a lot to start and then slow down. It would be good for them when they're thinking about playing their scales that their bow distribution is very even, that they think about making sure that there's no sudden increases in the bow speed. The violinist is using their left hand to tune the violin using their tuning pegs. You can see in their left hand that they're really reaching for these higher notes. Now there's a bit of a curve in their hand. If they were able to bring out their elbow a little bit further, it would help eliminate that curve and allow them to play more comfortably and more in tune in higher positions. The violinist is playing this scale by breaking the bow in two parts. This is a good exercise to do to develop more bow control. Intonation can be improved when playing in higher positions. They can think about bringing their elbow a little bit further out to help assist. Bring their hand higher up to help them feel more at ease when playing in higher positions. The violinist is playing a scale. These are common exercises for violinists to use to figure out where the left hand is supposed to go and where to play all the notes.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He uses his space nicely, legs are opened out, knees are bent, and then he had a nice little body roll in his chest in this moment too. So here he did a little roll up with his hips. I really like that he bent his knees really well, his weights on his front leg, and just with the back toe up. But he really pushed down and thrust his hips up from the bottom up really well. So the dance just starts with a couple of improvised steps where he's moving to the beat of the music really well. He does a little hip thrust and like kind of pumping his arms and then he does a little square jazz kind of square. It's also step around in a square while also pushing his shoulders really nicely and just taking the nice steps around the space. So this dancer in particular, I really do like that he's not afraid to just throw his body out there and go full out. He really does connect with the music really well and just kind of hitting different nuances that I think a beginner or intermediate dancer wouldn't really get, but as an advanced dancer, he really does feel the music all the way through. So from there, really nice spin out into this section. Really clean turn, kept his balance so he's now facing forward and then able to just stand with his legs out with nice body control. So here for the start of the choreography, he did a little step forward and twist his legs. And then I noticed when he crosses over in this motion with his right leg crossing front, he kind of throws his arm around really nicely. So just kind of giving a big push of energy, just kind of shifting from the beginning freestyle to really getting into the dance. So really nice job just not being afraid to throw his body around to really go full out in the movement.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They were matched down on this lateral pinch. And they just shot themselves out of a cannon, which is a common saying in climbing. Basically, they are moving too fast, then the boulder dictates. It results in poor technique on the climber's side. You see they are currently overshooting this hold. And they also just grab it poorly. So moving faster is not always going to save energy. Because if you climb poorly, it's going to cause more depletion. Because you have to readjust and slow down. And the moves end up taking just as long. And here you see the climber getting to this hold, but they're just fatigued, trying to move too fast again, fully stretched out on this hand, not really having a ton of control, hips are sagging now, and the moves that the climber was doing fairly easily are now coming to the climber a little bit more difficult.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So that little deception of moving the ball softly to the right and then snapping the ball back to the left, again is a technique just to change the direction of the ball. And what you'll notice is during this the player's balance is firm and foundational through having his feet shoulder width apart, slight knee bend and really maintaining the ball in front of him so he's in full control of his body as he tries to execute the technical action with the ball. You see the player again is doing a little sole roll with the right foot and this time instead of directly across his body the ball travels more in an angle across his body. But again what you'll notice is the surface of the foot making contact with the top of the ball as the balls of the feet. A soft touch, light touch to roll the ball, drag the ball and then as he finishes rolling over the top of the ball, moves his foot to the side out of the way of the path of the ball to allow the ball to travel across his body and then adjust his body to then receive the ball with the opposite foot. see the players just executing a L turn with the right foot so as the player approaches the ball to slow down player stops the ball with the sole of the right foot as he drags the ball back straight by his right foot you'll see his left foot starts to hop forward a little bit what this does is it creates the space for the player then to use the inside of the foot to push the ball behind the standing leg into the space what's good here from the players you can see is the player is now making contact with the ball with the inside of the right foot as you can already see the body starting to lean and move in the direction of the intended intended direction that he wants to take the ball on the dribble after the turn so it's important that our body moves in unison with the ball to maximize our control balance and speed And the player just executes in a little sole roll with his right across his body and we'll see the light touch with the ball with the balls of the feet with the top of the ball just rolling his foot gently across the ball to make the ball travel across his body in front. See the body's body position is somewhat upright but still leaning in the direction to the left. So that's the direction he wants to go is right to left so by leaning that way allows him to stay unified with the ball helps him improve with his speed and his balance and then as he rolls that ball across we want to move our left foot across and then obviously change our body position to then move back to the right if he intends to use his left foot back across his body. Here the player is just demonstrating a small L turn. So you see he stops the ball slightly in front of his left foot with, sorry, slightly in front of his right foot with his left foot, pulls the ball back with the sole of his foot. As he's pulling the ball back, you'll see a slight hop forward with his right foot to create the space to then roll the ball behind the standing leg. And you see the player has a slight bend in both of the knees, which brings him lower to the ground, better balance, better control. You see that the body is pretty much centered through his footwork, maintaining his balance throughout the action. Here the player is demonstrating again a little sole drag, sole roll with his right foot across his body. What's really good for me here is the contact point between the foot and the ball. So you see for the most part he's using the balls of his feet, the area underneath his toes to grip the ball and roll it across. By using that limited surface, it kind of restricts the contact between the ball and the foot so he's got more freedom of movement. As he's moving the ball across his body right to left, you see the body position of the player. So he's leaning on an angle, he's moving in the same direction as the ball is moving. This allows him to travel with more speed and quality. And then you'll notice as he's pulling the ball across, his left foot will then start to trail behind as he regains his full balance and control to then take his next touch. You see the position of the knee in relation to the ball is relatively close to being on top of it. This maximises the control and shows that the player has good balance and control with his body and the ball. We see here as the player finishes that little sole roll across his body with his right to his left foot. We see as the player then steps behind the ball with his right foot, he brings his left foot very quickly around the back to re-establish this position where his feet are shoulder width apart, good little knee bend there. So he's starting to bring his balance and control. He could probably sit down a little bit further into it in a game context but what we also like is as the player is controlling the ball with the inside of the left to bring the ball back, you can see the body is starting to lean in that way so we stay unified with the ball in the same direction that we're travelling. Here you see the player just finishing off the solo step over technique where the player drags the ball from his right foot across his body with the balls of his feet. He steps slightly behind the line of the ball with his right foot to allow the ball to go and then he steps over the ball with his opposite foot, here the left foot, where he then moves the ball, moves his left foot from the outside in across the line of the ball allowing the ball to travel through and across his body. The thing here is the player is not necessarily working against an opponent or at game speed so you'll see that the player as he steps over the ball is still very upright in his position so there's no disguise and probably want the player to be lower to the ground, disguise the skill by really stepping over and bending his knee in that step over to disguise the skill, get the player to move one way as the ball moves the other and then that will also provide him with the balance and low central gravity to then accelerate away with the ball the next time. I just want to focus on the players dribbling technique with the sole of the foot. So as the player is using this sole roll technique, pulling the ball across his body from right to left, I just want to really focus in on the contact point between the ball and the foot is underneath the toes, the ball of the foot. So limiting the contact between the foot and the ball means the player is less stuck to the ball, gives him more freedom and flexibility with his footwork to move both the ball and his feet. So you see as he's preparing to move the ball from his right foot across his body to his left, you see the angle of his body is starting to lean in the direction he wants to go. So as he moves that ball, that allows his footwork and his body to move with the ball. That will increase our balance, that will increase our ability to then move quickly in the direction of the ball and provide the player with a few more options. You see the player has a slight knee bend in his plant foot, that allows the player again balance, lower centre of gravity, it's going to help him with a change of speed, change of direction, also balance and protection of the ball. Here's a player using the sole roll with the right foot, using the balls of his feet, making minimal contact with the ball just to help with the speed of his footwork. As he generally rolls over the top of the ball, as he finishes the action you'll see he steps behind the line of the intended direction that he wants the ball to roll across his body. This allows him now to plant his right foot and move his left foot out to regain control of the ball. The player's not necessarily moving at any real speed, so he has pretty much control of his body even though we would ideally want him to be maybe a little bit lower to the ground, lower centre of gravity, bend his knees, sink his hips. So in terms of a game situation that change of speed, change of direction is a little bit faster and able to also protect the ball when under pressure. See the player is demonstrating a rollover, a sole roll with his right foot across his body to his left. You'll see the player grips the ball with the underside of the toes with the balls of the feet. This allows the player to stay agile and move his footwork with the ball. As he rolls over the ball with his right foot, you'll see then the right foot steps behind the line of the ball, allowing the path of the ball to be unobstructed. As he steps across, you'll see that his footwork moves his body across to get his left foot outside the line of the ball to be able to control it to then be able to continue to move the ball forward or back across his body. You'll see the player, in terms of his body movement, depending on which direction he was moving the ball, so whether he was going from right to left, his body was leaning right. As he's starting to now control the ball with his left foot, you can see that his body is now starting to lean again back to the right-hand side in the intended direction of the next pass or next touch. I just want to emphasize, the player utilizes the little solo drag across his body quite a lot, each time utilizing the balls of the feet, not the whole bottom of the foot. When we use the whole bottom of the foot, that maximum contact really slows us down, makes it harder for our footwork to adjust and move. So by just taking that little soft touch with the balls of the feet on top of the ball, there's more flexibility in the foot to be able to now come off the ball and step behind it, create the space for the ball to travel across the body. By working on the balls of our feet, it allows us to move lighter, softer, and move across behind the line of the ball as the ball travels. You see the player is in pretty good control of his body at the pace that we're working in, he's pretty slow, so he doesn't have to move an awful lot with the ball, but as he moves the ball, he moves his body in the same direction. here the player just executes in a little sole roll with his left foot across his body to his right and you'll see the part of the left foot that he uses is to grip the ball with the balls of his feet so it's a soft light touch allows him less contact with the ball so he can then move his foot behind the line of the ball and here you see the foot didn't quite get out the way the ball so there's a little bobble over his foot that he drags the ball with but because the players balance and footwork where as he rolls the ball he brings his right foot out to the side quite straight away and the players able to adjust to not moving his foot fully out the way and the bobble of the ball you also see as the player is now controlling the ball with the inside of the right foot to bring the ball back to the center you can see the body position of the player starting to lean back in the direction that he intends to go next Again, the player is just demonstrating a sole roll right across his body. So as he rolls the ball with the balls of his feet with his right foot and you'll see he steps behind the line of the ball, allows the ball to travel, quickly moves his footwork around so his left foot comes around the back to re-establish this good foundation position with his feet shoulder width apart. Depending on the direction the player is looking to go you can see the body is leaning towards the next direction that he's planning to go. So this just allows him to maintain control, balance, allows him to move at speed with the ball as he's changing speed, changing direction. see the player executing a L turn with his right foot so you see as the player approaches the turn stops ball with his right foot pulls the ball back moves his left foot slightly forward as he pulls the ball back to create the space to finish the L with the inside of his right foot behind his standing leg into the space see as the player is pulling the ball back and starting to push the ball behind his left leg his body starts to turn towards the direction he wants to go basically following the direction of the toe of the right foot and the direction that he wants to travel in next that's important as he moves with the ball generates speed and control as we do these skills we ideally would want the players to add disguise and be lower to the ground bend the knees sink the hips so we have better balance lower center of gravity more protection and the ability to now push off from that standing leg with more speed and acceleration away from the defender As the player finishes the solo with the right, what's very important is that as he finishes that movement, rolls over the ball with his right foot, his right foot steps behind the line of the ball to allow the ball to travel. But then as he brings his left foot around the back, you can see he re-establishes a good foundation of balance where his feet are now, shoulder width apart, slightly further. He's not as upright and his feet aren't close together so he can really maintain good balance, good control, keeps the ball directly in front of him. So he's maintaining control and balance as he goes through the action. Here you see the player just demonstrate a sole cruyff turn, not a full turn, just a little chop in between his feet. You'll see he uses the sole of his right foot to roll the ball behind the other standing leg. What I like here is obviously the left foot is kind of hopping and moving forward out of the way to create the path for the ball. As the player takes his touch across you can see his body movement is starting to turn towards the ball, keeps his eyes on the ball as he's about to turn. This just gives him a good visual perception of where the ball is and what he can do next.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

In this point, the climber had brought into a very close pull up so that she can bring her center of gravity close to the wall when going out for the reach. The climber right now is staring at the next hold at reach and we can see her extending the left leg and the arms to lean back. Now the climber being able to press onto the left toe is what brings her center of gravity underneath the grips. And as the climber is staring at the hold at distance is because the climber is lowering his center of gravity in order to perform a dynamic move next since the hold is at reach. The climbers are starting at a one-hole start where she places both of the hands onto the same hold. This is called matching and the climber is placing the hand to be wrapped around the lip of the hold as this is a positive hold being a jug and when it's really large, it's also called a bucket. This type of holds is mostly seen on beginner climbs as they are do not require a lot of energy to sustain on the grip. the climber performing the reach we can see how she yet to apply the grip over the lip of the hold and in doing so the climber's left foot has popped out of place. This was due to a lack of pressure when sending her hand over to the reach. It is important that if the climber was to attempt this again that she applies pressure of the left foot and in this case potentially the climber was placing the foot over to the right side of the hold and if she places the foot next time it needs to be done over the corner of that hold so that the climber will be able to roll the toe on top of the hold to apply pressure when transitioning out left. As we can see the climber first has thrown herself over to the right and quickly has dropped her center of gravity to extend the arms. This is because the climber is going to be performing a jump up to the hold at reach where she brings the center of gravity low to apply more pressure onto the feet when she gets to stand up and pull herself into the wall. So the climber is no longer standing on the mat and has placed the feet onto the holes of the wall. That means that the climber once off the mat then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

But if you pay attention to the first person image right here, we can see that they're basically touching the good side of the hold with their fingertips right there. So they're not exactly using it quite yet. But in this position, we can see that they're hanging on with their right hand. They do have a left foot that's behind their body, it's just kind of blocked in the image right here. And they're still using the right foot right here. And so because they're shifting their body weight over to the left right there, we can kind of see that they're limited in the full reach. Because the distance that we want to look at is the distance from their right foot to the left hand, which is the greatest distance that points from each other. And so because the climber is keeping the right foot on the foothold as they're completing this movement, they're realizing that they're coming up short and they're unable to really reach the good side of the hold that they're aiming for. So what I would always recommend climbers is to not become guilty of always relying on two feet being placed on the wall at every time. Because as we can see here, as climbers relying on two feet being present on the wall, it's forcing them to be short on their movement. And as a result, they're having to pull and engage with the arm a little bit more as they're hanging in this position right here to try and figure out how to get the rest of the movement. So what I would always encourage climbers is before even really committing to the next hand movement is by placing, in this case, they would be placing their right foot off of the foothold. And it would be turning into a flagging foot that would be kind of extended out into the wall. So that way they can kind of press and rotate their body over their left foot, and then they would get the full distance that they need instantly as opposed to trying to hang in this position to get the rest of the movement going. And so here we can see the Clown was able to move their left hand over into the next hand hold here and in this position we can see that they were using a right hand here as well as a right foot and they do have a left foot that we can kind of see a little bit right here. So in the same instance from their opening move we can kind of see another triangle of position right here. Right, so between the three points of contact and now we can see that their body is shifted to the left of that position right there. So it's always making, always important to make sure that you have a really good balance of what's going on with your body right here. So because the climber is moving over to the left it's okay to shift their body weight in the direction that they need to but as soon as they grab on to that next hold because they're grabbing on with that left hand now the triangle turns over into this block right here that I'm kind of zigzagging into. So now the triangle is shifted over to the left and they need to balance their points in that triangle right there. So what this climber needs to make sure they do is they get off of that right foot and turn it into a flagging foot so then that way they can keep the majority of the body weight between their left foot and the two hands that they're utilizing and this allows them to kind of move the right foot into the next position continuing the movement. And so here we can see the Clammer is making the final move of bringing the left hand over into this finish hold here. And in this position we can see that they're hanging on with their right hand here and they're still using a right foot right here. So because again they're using two points of contact that are on the same side of the body, it does make them in an imbalanced position so we can kind of see that what they're flagging for it's kind of taking a toll on them because it's kind of getting kicked out away from the wall here. So this foot because it's flagging out away from the wall, it actually helps to further pull them away from the wall. So if this Clammer was more tired or utilizing harder holds, this could result in them falling. Luckily it does seem for this Clammer they're very usable holds to finish on. So that's probably why this Clammer is okay with doing it in this form. So I would always recommend Clammers to really have good control of their body and their flagging foot before committing to hand moves just because if they just commit to a hand move it could cause them to become imbalanced and could lead to a fall. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring their right hand over so they're now matched onto the same handhold. But one thing that I'm noticing about this position is the climber is doing a good job of making sure that their left arm is in a very straight position, but what we can see is that a lot of their body weight is kind of hanging out and away from the wall. One of the reasons why I think that is is the climber might be comfortable with the handhold that they're using, but what I'm also seeing is kind of a lack of really adjusting their body weight over their right foot, just because that's the one foot that's on a foothold on the wall. So what I would definitely recommend the climber is kind of adjusting their body all the way more to the right, so then that way they can put more body weight on top of that right foot, and then that way instead of hanging out and away from the wall, they can allow their body to hang down underneath the hold, which would make it feel better, and that way they can place more body weight on their right foot altogether. So here we can see the climber was able to make the first move of bringing her right hand up into the next handhold here and the way the climber was able to do that was by using this left hand here and then we can see that they are using both a left foot as well as a right foot on the wall right here. So one thing I want to point out right here is because where their left hand is placed it's basically right in the middle of the two of the points which is their two other feet so what this does is it causes a natural balance in the climber just because they're very stationed they're very in a controlled position right here and if we think about it they're almost kind of creating a triangle shape with their body right between the three points we have from their hand to the left foot from the foot to the opposite foot and from their hand again to the right foot. So these lines kind of create a triangle and the idea is to always try and maintain this triangle of balance between three points of contact because ideally one points will be always moving on the wall just to kind of progress them on the wall. So here in this starting position we can see that the climber is in a very balanced position because their hand is in the middle of their two feet and this really helps to allow them to get good control and availability of moving on into the next move. So as we see them move up with that right hand into the next position we can see that the body is still stationary in the same position right here which just goes to show how much control they have as opposed to if they were to move one hand into the next position sometimes you can kind of see their body transition from one side to the next and that just kind of shows that they weren't in a good triangle or a good balanced position before continuing into this movement here but for this first move we can see that this climber wasn't really moving around that much once they made that move so just goes to show how controlled they were in this position. And so here we can see in the rest of that movement of reaching over to the left that the climber is now able to fully grasp onto that left hand there. And only after the climber is able to fully grab onto that left hand there we can see that their right foot is now off the foothold in a flagging position here. So this is ideally where I would want the climber to be with their flagging foot before even committing to that hand move. So then that way they can help conserve a little bit more energy and fully trust their left foot to be able to get them over into the move that they need. Obviously this is a little bit more of something to practice for kind of every climber because it is a very valuable tool that helps especially short climbers but can even help tall climbers to make sure that they can reach and fully weight their foot so then that way they're not slipping on any foothold. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing their left hand up into the next handhold here. And in this position we can see that the climber was hanging on with a right hand here, as well as their left foot in the main position. And we can see that the right foot did turn into a flagging foot. So that flagging foot just kind of helps to really rotate the body around that left foot. So then that way they can push off that left foot and get the amount of movement that they need. And so in this position we can see that the climber made a good rotation with their lower body so that the left side of their hip gets closer to the wall. So this is a really good use of their lower body into ensuring that they're using more of the lower body as opposed to pulling so much with their upper body. But we can see that the climber is still pulling in with their right arm there. So I would just kind of encourage them to really rotate their body a little bit more so that way they can help reduce the amount of upper body pulling that they're doing right here. And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing their left hand up into the next handhold here. And in this position we can see that the climber was hanging on with the right hand here as well as utilizing a right foot in this position here. Now, so because they're using two points of contact that are on the same side of the wall, again, which is the right hand and right foot, this kind of creates them in an imbalanced position. And what tends to want to happen is their body wants to rotate out and to the right, essentially around those two points. And that's because they have a lot of body weight that's to the left and naturally balance always wants to take place. And what that balance is, is their body wants to rotate over to the right around those two points. So what we can see is as the climber is reaching up with their left hand, their left foot is in a flagging position. And right now their flagging position is kind of down in this position right here. So I would actually not encourage a flagging position in this angle right here, just because it's keeping them in that narrow position as well within the right hand and right foot. So what I would actually encourage them is to flag their left leg over to the right on the right side of the two points that they're making contact with the wall. So then that way they can help distribute a little bit of their body weight over to the right. So then that way they feel less rotation going on in their body. But what we can see is because the climber is having their left foot flagging down into the middle, they are having to engage the right arm ever so slightly to try and pull them up into the next movement here. So because they're using two points on the same side of the body, they're being forced to use a little bit more energy and a little bit more tools in order to make sure that they can accomplish this movement here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The climbers is starting at a one-hold start, both of the hands placed into the same hole. This is called matching and he places with both hands as a pinch grip. This is because the climber is placing the fingers above and the thumb at the bottom. Placing the thumb onto the other side helps the climber to generate more power onto the grip and once a climber gets to secure the grip placement he will be able to then lean back to apply weight to the grips.

In this position we can see that the climber was hanging on with their right hand and they did utilize a left foot kind of in this higher position here. So because they're using opposite points of contact with each other, this does actually allow the climber to really rotate and pivot her body accordingly. So we can see that the climber is able to rotate their body so that the left side of the body gets closer to the wall, which does help with this left hand movement. And then one very important thing is what she's doing with her right foot. So we can see that it's flagging out into the right right here. So that's really helping to control her movements so that she can rotate in the direction that she needs to. And it's really good to see that the climber is having really good control of that flagging foot by keeping it in a static position up against the wall from the beginning of the move all the way to the end of the move. So that shows that the climber is really focusing on what's going on with their footwork in this climb here. So here we can see that the climber has brought in her right foot, so it's now in this position here. It's kind of hard to say exactly where her left foot is, but it might be flagging up against the wall in a small way. But one thing I keep on noticing though is that the climber is allowing herself to kind of swing back and forth from left to right, and one of the main reasons I think that is the case is because we can see that both of her hands are stacked on top of each other, and that she is also deciding to place both her feet in a very narrow position, kind of close to that position as well. So this does allow the climber to be able to rotate back and forth around those points. So this kind of shows that the climber is not really getting full control of what's going on with their body weight here. So I would definitely encourage the climber to really focus on flagging that left foot around the corner of the wall, so then that way she can get more control of her body, and it's no longer swinging from left to right, and this will allow her to kind of move into the next movement that she needs to do.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

His fingers are in the correct spots and he's using the fingertips of his fingers to get the correct notes to sound. He's getting a nice tone from plucking the strings here. He is plucking with his fingertips and not so much his fingernails, but he's using it with the right amount of weight and pressure so that each note rings out pretty clearly with the help of the amplification system. This is the correct chord shape for the note that he's trying to play there. Earlier he had a different chord shape, so there were incorrect notes that were sounding. If he moved his leg over here and sat a little bit taller, I think it would be easier for him to navigate the fingerboard and play the guitar a little bit more efficiently. He's doing this finger pattern accurately, so he's kind of alternating between thumb, middle finger, pointer finger, and then the ring finger, and then the ring finger plays about four notes in a row. And so he's doing this finger pattern slowly, but he is doing it accurately. As he's reading these notes, he's changing between chords a little bit slowly, so it might be possible that he's seeing this music for the first time, and he's really focusing more on just making sure he's playing the correct notes, but not really on a very coherent musical expressive phrase.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Here I will repeat some of my comments from previous videos about making sure that they rotate their shoulders and incorporate their torso to create more fluidity of movement. I would encourage the dancer to start with a bended knee. Right now you can see their knees are locked, which makes it hard to start movement. So a slight bend in the knee will help with this movement that is about to happen. The dancer is doing a lot of complex steps here. They step over, they reach to the side, they do a body roll. I think to create more fluidity and also have range of motion in this, to have more precision, because having more range of motions allows you with a bigger base to create that precision, they would have to plie even more, bend their knees and stick their bum out a bit to create this arc that they have, can move through. I would have more intention to detail at this beginning step right here even though it's a slight, slight two-step I wouldn't throw away the movement I would still give it the same energy and attack as as the dancer gives the rest of the dance.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She has a lot of energy, he doesn't have much energy. It's important in a partnership for them to be paired and on the same vibe, like on the same level. She is outperforming him. So the extent in which she's performing is good. However, in terms of her being part of a partnership, it's not so good. Because they shouldn't be looking at it so much as two soloists. They should be looking like one duet or one partnership of two people. So even though they're disconnected physically, meaning they're not holding hands, they still should look as if they're dancing in the same realm, in the same world. And it doesn't very much still look like that. Also, she is kind of turning herself here and is not necessarily taking his lead, which is why they lose hand contact because she is just spinning herself. And instead of spinning herself, she needs to allow him to be spinning her. He is leading her, and so her arms should only move as a result of him moving her arms. The dancer is not on timing with the music. She is a bit behind and slow, but also she has to take the timing off of the male in the black that's leading. So as long as he's leading off timing, she will continue to be off timing. Um, they're just not operating in their designated roles of leader and follower. She's doing well and showing a variety of steps, but the dancer in the black dress said he is mimicking her as the leader he should be leading and she should be more so mimicking him. So there's just a disconnect here. It's hard to evaluate the dancer in the pink as a follower because she is dancing more as a leader. And it's just hard to evaluate them individually when they are a partnership. She is dancing with a lot of energy. When she's moving around she's using creativity, bringing her arms up and down, spinning around. So in this freestyle she is alternating directions. She's also alternating levels of her limbs and arms. So that aspect in terms of creativity is good. She is dancing on flat feet. Her whole foot is on the ground. She should be dancing on her toes with her heels lifted off the ground so that all of these directional changes, forward and backwards, right and left, for her, could be done more easily. Um the I'll be commenting on the dancer wearing all pink because she's the one that's wearing the goggles. Um her Rib cage and upper body is very loose So as she's doing these a step touches horizontally to her right and her left her upper body from her neck to her Hips is swaying quite a lot and also a rotating wall rotating backwards and forwards, um Rotating both directions as she is stepping sideways and it's um too much movement and takes away from the actual footwork Again, this is another situation where she just starts spinning herself and it's not really taking the lead from him, but I will say he is not being very clear and adamant. He needs to be strong in his arms to lead her, and so she is not getting that proper lead. The dancers let go of hand contact. They should be in hand contact the entire time. So when she is turning, she should still be holding his hand. The dancer in the pink is mimicking or sorry is mirroring the dancer in the black who is the leader She's following him. So When he is using his left foot To travel towards the chairs. She's traveling in that same direction but instead Using her left foot. She's using her right foot. So they're both using the side of the body that is facing each other and so they're Partnering as if they're looking in a mirror so she is following his movements exactly here.

He then looks down, being extended at the feet, and needs to be purposeful the way that he switches his feet. So he brings the right foot to meet where the left foot is, and once he applies pressure with the right toe on the hold, then the climber will be able to release the left foot to the next stance. Here, in order for the climber to recover out of the swing, he must hold on to the grips tight and tense the body to not allow the swing to go completely out, peeling him off the wall. So, the climber must engage the core and this will be transferred down to the legs so that the climber is able to pick up the legs and make a foot placement as soon as he gains momentum on the swing back. The climber has brought the left foot down and it's important that the climber glances over to make an accurate placement of the feet. This one because the left foot is going to be taking place instead of the right foot. As we can see the climber is pulling on the grips to release some pressure down at the feet while making the switch. It's important that the climber is still activating some sort of pressure down at the feet as if he doesn't apply any pressure it will make the climber swing out of the wall. So as the climber is making the switch we can see how the left toe is being placed above the right toe. And this so that the climber in the moment he hops over the right foot can take place above the hold while releasing the right foot out of the placement. Here the climber was able to generate power on the pole to make the reach up to the next hold. As we can see the hold that the right hand is sustaining is a jug, so this seems as a positive hold and a promising hold too. The climber secured the grip once placing the hand. The left foot wasn't used in this instance to generate power on the stance, it just was helpful for the climber to keep himself still on the wall without cutting feet. As the climber had made the reach up to the pinch, this one placing the fingers on the outside and the thumb on the inside, this will make the climber generate power by squeezing on that hold, which is mostly generated with a lot of pressure with the thumb being on the opposite side where the fingers are placed. Now the climber must create pressure not only by squeezing the hold but also leaning onto the hold to create friction and maintain that stance. As the climber was going up for the reach, we can see how his right side is towards the wall and this will help the climber when obtaining the reach as he had made the stance on the right foot to gain height. Also it's important that the climber had kept the right side towards the wall, which he has made on the forceful pull up. Here the climber has made the move of the left hand up to the next hold. Now the climber is sending the right leg extended. This is called flagging out which helps the climber to shift the weight over to be placed on the foot placed down below as he made the stance. The flagging out helps the climber to keep balance when going out for the reach as he shifted the weight over to the foot supporting him when making the stance. Here the climber quickly after resting the arm he made a pull up move to release the left foot that was a distance and made the move up to the next hold, the right hand grip. As soon as that one was positioned we can see how the jug is so secured that the climber is able to hold it down below to pull himself into the wall as he was making the stance on the right foot. Now the climber has brought the left foot into placement and is glancing over to what the next move may be as he would need to bring his left hand at a higher stance. Since this is a rest position, the climber has sent his right hand down and is shaking it. This is to release any tension that the climber potentially has built up to this point. As soon as the climber is ready resting that arm, he will then place it back onto the hold. Here the climber is starting at a two hand hold start. The right hand being placed on a sloper, this means that the climber must maintain pressure by creating friction between the fingertips and creating weight by him leaning underneath the hold. Now the left hand is placed on a jug where the climber is able to curl the fingers behind it and pull the hold out in order to keep pressure. As we can see the climber has made a foot placement, right foot down on the foot chip and the left foot much elevated where he places the middle of the foot, outer edge, towards the hold. Now that the climber is off the mat then the climb has started. The climber here has sent the right hand to match at the last hold. Once the climber has sustained the hand placement for three seconds, then the climber has completed the problem. In order for the climber to make it to the last hold, the climber had engaged into a forceful pull up from his last hand placement, the left hand going again for another move up the sequence. He was able to place the hand above the hold and the fingers to slide behind the lip of that hold. This is called a jug, so the climber is able to sustain that positive grip and curls the fingers in order to engage the grip and pulling onto the hold. Now because the climber has now shifted the weight to the highest placed hand, we can see how the climber has lost touch of the right foot placement with the hold and is out on the swing. In order for the climber to sustain his swing, he must press down on the foot, that's the left foot. But in this case, if the climber's right foot is swinging, the left foot might come out of the swing as well, so the climber must apply tight grip in order to sustain cutting feet. The climber made a quick right foot placement at a higher stance and send the left hand to match the right hand on the jug. Now that the climber is in the secure grip, meaning that it's a big lip that sticks out, the climber can rely on the force of the grips and disengage the arms, meaning he's leaning back and this is count as a rest position as he's able to rest the shoulders as well while he glances over for the next moves. Here we can see how the climber was able to make the reach up with the left hand to the next hold. And in this one, the right foot has remained with the leg extended. This one is called flagging in. And the flagging position is to keep the climber stable when making the move and keep his hips close to the wall. This is because the climber needed to transfer the weight over to the highest foot. And where the climber has placed the foot by putting the bottom of the sole towards the middle of the foot. The climber must press down on the hold to gain height when at the reach. Here the climber has engaged in a forceful pull to make the right hand positioning to the pinch. As we can see, the climber was able to gain reach due to pressing down on the foot down below. And to maintain the grip, the climber is placing the fingers onto the right side of the hold and the thumb on the other. This to generate power by pressing into the hold. The thumb will help the climber generate pressure to maintain a clamp position onto that hold. And as the climber had brought himself in, blocking the move, now the climber is going to be able to lean on that hold above.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Here we have the climber, kind of two moves in, start holds down here, and then move left into this jug, which is kind of the start of the boulder, because that first move is not very hard. Quick foot switch into the right foot here, able to lock this jug down and reach up to this pinch here.

And in this movement we can see that the climber is doing a dynamic movement. But one thing I want to definitely point out is what we can see is with her left arm here, we can kind of see how much she's pulling in with her body right here, or with her upper body. So that kind of shows to me that the climber is really relying on her upper body to be the main force or the main power to get her up into this next position. But what I would actually encourage for the climber is if she kind of strained out her arms a little bit more. So then that way she can kind of focus on transitioning her body weight more over this left foot here. Just because it does seem like that left foot is a pretty big foot to utilize. So she should be able to use it in a better way. And trying to avoid how much her upper body is doing right now because it does take away from how much her lower body can work right now. And so here we can see that as the climber is getting closer to reaching that left hand that they're aiming for We can see that the left foot has now slipped off of the foothold here And one of the main reasons why I think that is is because the climber is focusing so much on Getting their upper body closer to the wall And by producing the power with their upper body it helps to take away some of their body weight from their feet And as a result, that's why their left foot is coming off this foothold right here But because that foothold is now off the wall and we can see the rest of the body Is starting to fall away from the wall as well So it does mean that the climber has a harder time of actually grabbing on to that left and hold that they're aiming for", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He's got a deeper bend in his knees with his pelvis dropped back and activated within the movement and is finding a lot of nice clarity in his footwork here. Overall, this is a high point for the dancer, a moment of shine where they really appear confident and clear in their movement. As the dancer continues into this transitional step that's locomoting him through the space and also incorporates kind of a chasse and a ball change here with his feet, he's going in and out of connection with the rhythm, particularly in the use of his footwork when he performs the chasse or the small jump in between ball change steps. He's struggling to keep that connected to the rhythm. However, he's got this nice soft bend in his knees, his pelvis is loose, and his upper body appears relaxed. He's also got a nice point of connection with his arm with his partner, which overall demonstrates that he might not be able to fully embody the rhythm, but he does have a working understanding of the movement vocabulary. As the dancer transitions into this walking pattern or this kind of exaggerated walk where they're really stepping their heel down, keeping their toe lifted, and then dropping their toe rhythmically, they're more deeply connected to the rhythm here. They have a nice sense of bounce in their movement, which is connecting them to the music. And it's particularly thanks to the soft bend in their knees and the nice kind of loose activation of their pelvis. As the dancer transitions back into this chasse ball change or this triple step into a rock step movement, they appear much more confident than they did at the beginning of the dance. They have a sense of ease about their movement, which is connecting them to the rhythm. They're maintaining a nice soft bend in their knees with an active range of motion in their pelvis, which is helping them to move quickly and efficiently. As a dancer begins with the basic step that's locomoting him through the space slightly with his partner, he is struggling to connect to the rhythm right away, particularly through his footwork. While he has some clarity in the mechanics of the footwork, he's struggling to connect them to the rhythm and he would benefit from bending the knees a bit more, finding a soft bend there, as well as incorporating some motion up through the pelvis so that he could be more stable, consistent, and connected to the rhythm. As the dancer goes to transition into the twist here with their legs from a rock step or a small jump into a rock step, they really struggle with this transition. They could probably just use a bit more rehearsal here, especially some rehearsal with their partner so that they could even out their weight distribution and their movement pattern, but overall they need to find some clarity and some refinement through this transitional moment. As the dancer faces their partner again and performs this chasse with a ball change backwards or a triple step in a rock step, it might be called in some social dances, they are struggling to perform the rock step because they're not allowing themselves to have enough bend in their knees. So it's really limiting their range of motion in their legs as well as their pelvis, which is keeping them disconnected from the rhythm in general. If they were to bring a softer bend to their knees, dropping their pelvis back and down, they would have more control over the rock step and be able to connect more consistently with the music. As the dancer transitions into this chasse step where he's moving throughout the room locomoting slightly, particularly forward and backwards within the space, he starts to catch a connection to the rhythm here and stays fairly consistent as he starts to perform this step. He's finding some clarity in his footwork as well as some deeper embodiment of the rhythm, has a nice soft bend in his knees which is helping him to move quickly and efficiently, and overall has a confident and soft presence.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

All because that right knee is kind of facing inwards and all that pressure is kind of being applied the opposite way. And there's also one more thing with his left foot when he makes the jump that could be a little bit cleaner. So here we can see he starts to climb good, his arms are nice and straight. He's going up to this green hold up to the right, so you can see his right knee is facing outwards. He can kind of, he starts in a good position so he can kind of rock over and spring from it. But when he actually makes the jump, you'll see that his right knee goes from facing outwards to the right, more towards inward to the left. And his left foot kind of does this little kind of all scorpion move right away. So that's kind of also going to be sending his weight kind of straight back instead of upwards. So, between the one knee, between the right foot kind of pushing him left and this one's going to kind of be pushing him right. So, it's like it's going to be kind of a lot of twisting his body and nothing's kind of furthering his push upwards into the right. So, this is all going to kind of work against him to limit his power. So now you can see that his left knee has turned inwards, which means when he pushes down it's kind of pushing down at this angle. So as he kind of swings up to go this way, the pressure on that foot is actually going to kind of send him out from the wall. It's going to cause him to kind of come out from the wall like this. So he's kind of applying the force in the wrong direction instead of rocking over onto it.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Giving himself a great chance at making it every time as long as he can get it close to the white box or even inside the white box. After the make or mislay up, you want to come down on both feet simultaneously for balance and safety purposes. As he's dribbling, he's standing straight up. If he could create a lower center of gravity, which will allow the ball to travel at a shorter distance, he's less likely of getting stripped or a defender coming in trying to steal it. Right here, follow through is kind of low. You want to make sure that follow through is staying consistent and going towards the target. Bringing the ball here, ideally you would want it closer to your body and kind of chest up high. That way once you go up for the layup you can explode up here versus bringing it up from here versus rounding it off. I would say ideally starting this drill up a little bit higher for a better angle, but since the wall is there, I understand why he's starting a little bit low. Good job jumping off the left foot on the right side and landing that with the right hand. Body is straight up and down, so that's good body placement.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

But having precision throughout their body will increase their musicality and their attempt to stay on the beat. Nice attempt for this dancer to take big steps. I would encourage to improve this movement for them to plie or to bend their legs more, sending their energy down. And then they'll be able to have a greater range of motion to even take bigger, gigantic steps and really cut across space that would improve the quality of an overall look and feel of the dance. This is a nice attempt. I would encourage the dancer to have more effort and energy And really have more attack and hustle throughout the movement to raise the level of proficiency I would encourage this dancer to think about the musicality and rhythm because they're not on the beat. So really taking the time to practice the steps and listen to the music in tandem is really important. And would improve the overall look and feel of this basic choreography. I would encourage the dancer to plie in order to more successfully complete these twists side to side and also to work by pressing down into the balls of their feet. I will also repeat my previous comments about how look how the shoulders are rolled in. Make sure you roll them up back and out and think about really lifting the gaze to exude more confidence but also have more stage and dynamic presence in the movement. This would of course improve the overall look, quality, and feel of the dance. I would encourage the dancer to think about their shoulders. Often their shoulders and their focus is down. I would encourage them to roll their shoulders up, back, and out, so they have a bigger circumference to work from, and their energy from their chest is communicating confidence, and the dynamic quality will be improved by this. And also for their focus to be out as well instead of looking at the floor. I would encourage the dancer to let go of the tension in their fingertips and make sure that their energy doesn't stop at the wrist because we tend to hold tension in our hands when we are either nervous or thinking really hard about choreography.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

As we look on the left side of the frame on our player's release from his right-handed micing layup attempt, we can notice that the player does a decent job of getting his follow-through going towards the direction of the rim, allowing the ball to create the proper spin and rotation it needs to hit our target point, the top right corner of the box on the backboard, allowing the ball to develop the proper angle it needs of dropping inside the rim. Looking at the finished result of the players attempted left-handed micing layup on the left side of the frame due to our players inability to get enough lift off the ground The ball did not gain enough arc and accuracy to get above the rim instead will hit the side of the rim missing short Resulting in an incomplete layup attempt Looking at the player going into his left-handed Mike and Leib attempt on the right frame, some improvements the player needs to make to become more efficient on his attempt is again, starting his body placement position lower in the athletic stance to allow more lift, going into his jumping motion, carrying his body's momentum towards the left side of the rim.

Looking at the player going into his right-handed mic and layup attempt, some improvements the player needs to make to become more balanced, quicker, and explosive on his attempted layup is to start his body placement position lower in an athletic stance. Looking at the release of the players left-handed mic and layup attempt, we can notice that the player did not do a great job of getting his follow through, going towards the direction of the basket, which did not allow the ball to travel directly towards our target area, which is gonna be the top left corner of the box on the backboard. Instead allowing it to travel above the rim with too much power and force, allowing it no opportunity of dropping in the rim, resulting in an incomplete layup attempt. Looking at the player going into his left-handed Mike and layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice that the player does a good job using and jumping off his right leg, allowing his body's momentum to potentially carry him towards the left side of the rim.

This the climber will have to generate a lot of pressure when sustaining the hold grip. This is because the climber will forcefully swing out of the wall so it's important that the climber engages on the core the moment that he touches the hold. At this moment his right foot is out for a land so this could potentially compromise the climber when trying to achieve body tension to sustain the swing. Here, the climber is swinging out to the left, slightly to the right, and again swings out to the left forcefully. This because the climber is generating power for when making a powerful stance, which he will need to commit by making a forceful push that will lift him up through the air and for a hot second to bring his right hand to be placed at the hole that is at reach. This is called dyno. So the climber needs to generate a lot of power and his last foot that he will need to rely on the last placement for the push would be the right foot once when reaching a certain distance. However, it's important that the climber brings his chest forward to bring his center of gravity close to the wall. This will help with the reach. Here the climber is starting at a two-hand hold start, both of them being doughnuts. The climber is able to place his hands at the bottom of the doughnut. In order to apply force with the left hand, we can see how he's relying on giving pressure to the grip by leaning back as the fingers are the ones that are placed inside and the thumb is just to keep him in place. But with the right hand, he's creating more force by pinching on the grip with the thumb underneath and it's a more positive hold as it curves in. Now the climber will be able to start the climb once the feet are off the ground. And as we can see, the climber has his right foot placed on a solid hold that sticks out, making it comfortable to make a stance that's supportive. And then the left foot is already placed on a foot chip down below. The climber was able to maintain body tension and avoid having a swing by sending the foot going outwards, giving it more movement to potentially peel off the wall. However, the climber wasn't able to apply sufficient pressure on the grip and as we can see his right hand is already coming off the hold. Now that the climber's grip is off the hold and the climb will land on the mat and the climb is over. Here, the climber was in bringing his center of gravity with him as close as he should have for the wall. This is all engaged on the pull in that he would have to force with his arms. And he said he's at a great distance away from the wall. He was able to transfer his weight over to the highest foot being the right one, reason why we can see all of his body leap at the right direction. Now the climber is sending his right hand up to the hold, hoping to land the hold by keeping an open grip, meaning that the climber will have to palm the hold from above in order to create friction at the hold and will have to create body tension in order to sustain the grip. Here we can see the climber lowering his center of gravity forcefully, keeping his arms extended and disengaging the shoulders. This is so he can be able to drop his weight and transfer the weight over to the feet that are at a higher stance.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He took kind of a double step on his right foot, and now he is off the music. So I don't know why he just hesitated, but he should have just kept the music, kept his feet going with the music and he would have been fine, but he took a double step and hesitated. So now he's going to be off the music for the rest of the recording. And I think it's because his body is a little more stiff, and if he would bend his knees more, I think that would help to loosen up his body from the foot on up, because the steps are guided by his feet. So he wants to kind of layer everything from his body. So his knees will then influence his hips, will then influence his chest, and his shoulders, and his head, and it all flows that way. Yeah I think timing really messed this one up. I think it could have been a really nice simple beginner bachata but his timing was off for most of the time so it really messed up the full effect of the dance. Here he does a nice little, um, a different step where he turns his body, he's rotating around to face, um, the camera and then he turns back away from the camera. Um, and he's just taking step, step, step, touch, and then step, step, step, touch, but it really flowed nicely. And I think if he was on the correct beat of the Bachata music, it would have been even better. The dancer is starting with a bachata step and with bachata it is the same beat throughout the entire song. Every bachata song sounds alike so once you get the basics of the step which will make this more of a beginner video it's just easy to kind of stay along with the rhythm because the rhythm is right there. This dancer he's doing the bachata step side by side so step together step touch and then he goes to the other direction going left and right. He is doing the timing correctly so he's doing the correct steps but his body needs to be adjusted where the last step so step together step touch that last touch your hip kind of pops up to the side depending on what leg so on this side his right hip would pop up when he does the last step and that you hear it also in the music so you add you want to make sure the rest of your body is moving along with your feet. So here the music starts to pick up a little bit. It was a nice unexpected thing with the music and his energy also picked up which is really good because he is doing the same steps over and over again so it does get a little monotonous but with the music change he definitely changed his energy as well. I really do like that he made the transition along with the music to turn around and face the other direction. So that was a really good ear to the music knowing, oh, this is a good time to turn around and face the other way. And he did it very seamlessly, really nice, smooth transition. And I notice he's moving his shoulders as well, which is nice, and then kind of lifting his arms up and down, but it's still just the the groove of the bachata step. He's not quite in the pocket, as some would say, of the step.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I don't believe this was choreographed, which shows a sense of artistic liberation and awareness of her own body, which is great. I now challenge her to extend this even further. She's rotating her rib cage in a circle here as her arms are up, and she can rotate her ribs in that circle even further. The circular movement that she's doing with her ribs around and around can be even bigger and exaggerated. The dancers arms are very free. She's dancing very fluidly with her upper body as well Her legs are clearly gliding across the floor As she's making a bit of a box shape as she's coming around So her feet are doing something complicated, but her arms are also Dancing while she's doing all this footwork And if we were to just look at her upper body We wouldn't know that her feet are doing all this movement and I say that to mean that she's remaining very calm While she's dancing like her feet are not throwing her upper body off her upper body is not throwing her legs off She's moving in tandem from head to toe all parts of her body dancing The dancer can add more dynamics into her dance by leaning forward when she comes forward, like with her torso. Or she could also stylize this movement by shimmying or shaking her shoulders in this step so that it's not so monotone, forward-center, back-center, but that she adds extra energy and dynamics on top of the movement. The dancer is very graceful when she's moving and elegant. However, she can have more energy in her arms by extending her arm completely straight outward, especially through her fingertips so that her fingertips complete the line of her arm. The dancer can hit this position here with more energy and striking the position so that her dancing is not monotone and it has ups and downs. Overall she's very fluid, she's very graceful, she's very elegant, but she would benefit from having a few moments of just energy bursting out to create some sort of excitement to watch. The dancer is tapping her toes right and left alternating very lightly with her heel off the ground of whatever foot it is that she's tapping. That is great. She can exaggerate her movement now more here by moving her hips more in this movement and bending her knees to allow her hips to move freely and just overall having more energy and making her movement more dynamic. The dancer does a really good job here of lengthening her arms far upward so that they are consolidated close when she turns, but are not scrunched down towards her head. She still is elongated and has a length to her while she's turning. The dancer is looking to her right each time she extends her right arm out, but she doesn't also look to her left each time that she extends her left arm out. So this should be consistent. If she's going to look to her right when she extends her right arm out, she also should be looking to her left when she extends her left arm outward. The dancer made a small mistake here stepping forward with the wrong foot but she quickly corrects this mistake and gets back on rhythm and gets back on the correct foot that she was meant to be on which is a great way of just picking up where you left off and figuring it out. The mistake is not blaring, it's not apparent and she doesn't look anywhere else in the room which basically helps hide the mistake so that it's very short-lived especially because she remains focused so if we're looking at her face and her eyes we don't really see that she made a mistake we might not have even noticed. The dancer had a really great spot with her eyes. She began looking forward, straight ahead, and as she completed that revolution or that turnaround, she also continued to spot forward. That way she was able to start and end the turn very neatly, always looking at the exact spot on the curtain and what she wanted to end up. And so she never got disoriented and was able to complete the turn very neatly. The dancer is in perfect rhythm going forward one two coming back to the center and three Holding count four going backwards five six coming back to the center on seven holding count eight She's also doing this on her toes the whole time as we see her heels are lifted off the ground And that is why she's able to be so mobile so easily The dancer is very light on her feet. Her weight is shifted towards her toes and her heels are off the ground, which is great.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Again, that ball, see how the ball's kind of behind her hand? So that tells me on its way up it kind of became unstable and maybe moved a little bit, which throws off the accuracy. I think here's her guide hand. There's a pretty, I love how she extended the right elbow. That's good. And she's got a little lift here. Does she have the right angle here? It may hit a little bit of the rim here. Again, a lot of the push-off is on that right foot and leg. We want it to be on the left foot. Much better job of extending the arm and getting the ball. Looks like it's a little bit more out in front of that hand. There's that wrist that snaps it down. Here's our guide arm. She's got does a good job of keeping that up there. Again, she squares her body by going off two feet. This is not bad here. See the ball coming off the fingertips here. Here's her guide hand. Looks like she's a little bit square to the to the backboard. Again, she pivots here a little bit too soon. The footwork really isn't what ideal for what we need for the layup, for the right hand layup. We need to land on this left and really pull that right knee up. Here she kind of dips down, see how her dip that right elbow and shoulder. She does have the guide hand up, which is really nice to see as she raises the ball. It starts to come off. Again, I don't know if the angle is there to use the top of that square on the backboard. She's taking teeny little steps. She could take one big step here with the left foot and use it to help pivot and square her body. She kind of shuffles her feet a little bit, in some cases maybe even traveling, but I love how she moves with two hands on the ball. She uses that shooting hand there on the one side, the left hand on the side, and her eyes and head are up. So she's kind of stops. You know, ideally we'd love to her to plant this left foot and really push off and pull the right knee up. She's choosing to kind of go off two feet, but again it's it's she doesn't really have that sharp angle that you need. It's a little bit too straight on, therefore she can't really use that top of that square. Again, not the ideal footwork for explosiveness and lift, but she does gather both feet. Here the guide hand comes off, her shooting hands behind the ball. Looks like a little better angle here to use the backboard. Here she's starting on the left side. She took a dribble. See how she looks down at the ball. So again, you know, ball handling dribble moves are so important and being able to to look up, look for a teammate, look at the rim without looking at it. That's a skill within itself. Here, it may even hit rim a little bit. There's just really not a lot of room for error here. Again, I like she's trying to get up off the ground off two feet. Good extension here of the hips. Here the shooter shooting a right-hand reverse layup. She's taking the ball up with just one hand. I'd love to see the the second hand a little bit on the ball a little bit longer, but you know she's got it sitting back here which is good. I see the guide hand though, the guide arm is up there. I think she would you know see how she's kind of like flat here like we got to get a little better spacing here and angle where she could use the top of that square. Here we're just a little straight on we need to be more at a 45 degree angle to use that. Here's our target. It's tough that's a tough angle right there to finish. Again, chooses to go off two feet with a lot of the weight here on the right foot though. Again, at the end of the day, it's okay when you're learning. Again, that ball's a little behind her follow-through. We want it to be out ahead of that hand. She's got really good extension of the hips here. That's good to see, and that arm bar is up there. See the ball kind of coming back off the fingertips? Somewhere in there, she lost a little bit of the control. We want that ball out in front of that hand, high on the backboard. Again, a lot of her weight here on the right foot. Ideally, we want to go off the left foot and really pull that right knee up, so she would benefit from just working on a simple layup, maybe with the footwork, with a one-step movement. Here, it looks like it's got a better chance of hitting the top of that square. Good extension and reach here. Arm bars up, but again, all that weight on that right leg. We want it to be on the left foot. Again, takes a little hop here, lands on two feet. You know, at the end of the day there's nothing wrong with going off two feet. It's a little quicker and more explosive if you would really get timing and push off that left foot. But here she's eyeing our target. Again, not really sure of the angle, the spacing that she needs to use the top of that square. And you know, and sometimes the ball just coming out of that right hand doesn't have a lot of control. So therefore the ball's hitting really high on the backboard here. And her follow-through is across her body. We'd like it to be more straight on. And then continued work here on the footwork. Here she, her footwork, you know, she would benefit from really working on the footwork to shoot. Sometimes you could just take one step or two steps to shoot the layup or use a dribble. I think the dribble for her would come later. But here she's, you know, she's taking the steps she needs to get there. She may be planning this left foot a little bit too soon to get the proper angle. I love that her eyes are up. She's got two hands on the ball as she moves left to right.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Looking at the finished result of our player's midrange attempted jump shot, we can notice in both frames the player provided enough arc momentum and power to get the ball towards our target point. Hitting our target point, which is going to be the midpoint between the rim, allowing the ball to drop inside, resulting in a completed attempted jump shot. Looking at the player going into his right-handed mid-range attempted jump shot on the right frame. Again, the player does well holding his fall through extended above his shoulder, allowing the ball to continue its gain of arc momentum and power to head directly towards our target, which is the rim, helping it drop inside. Looking at the player going into his mid-range attempted jump shot on the right frame. We can notice that the player did well getting his elbow aligned towards the front of the rim. Allowing the ball after the release to travel and stay in the correct alignment. Looking at the player going into his mid-range attempted jump shot on the left frame, we can notice the player did well, snapping his wrist and fall through downwards towards the direction of the rim, helping the ball travel and stay in the correct alignment and knees getting above the rim, potentially dropping inside the net. Looking at the player's release on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player did well getting his fall through extended high above his shoulder, allowing the ball to gain more arc and accuracy on his shot without jumping on the release. Looking at the player's release on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player can improve on jumping on his shot, allowing the ball more arc and momentum to travel above the rim, helping it develop the proper angle it needs of dropping inside the rim.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And same thing with when he crosses over and steps out to the side, really trying to push that hip out to the side as he steps out, and just to help with the flow of his full body. So the dancer starts taking steps in place. He is essentially doing this step correctly with the right timing and he's circling his arms around but I do think he's a bit stiff in like his chest area so you really want to loosen all of that up so your arms are not doing such hard work. All right, really good job on the turns. He was able to spot and make it all the way around, keeping his balance and then landing front and center. So here when he's stepping forward and back, his feet are a little flat so it definitely draws the energy down a bit so I would recommend dancing a bit more on the toes so it's a little bit lighter but good job keeping the knees bent just make sure you're not stepping flat on the floor. And when he steps out to the side, again using his hips a little bit more, that would definitely help to loosen up the rest of his body. So as he steps out, really pushing that hip out along with his leg just to kind of separate his hip from his waist and give a little more fluid movement in the body.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The details of their hands moving, of where their feet should be, of how their head cuts through space, of where their hips should be. All of those things create a successful intermediate salsa and take you from novice to professional. So I would encourage the dancer to think about all of those details that feel miniscule but make all the difference. I would encourage them again here to really plie deep so we can see this winding of the hips. I would encourage the dancer to begin the step being more grounded so we can really see the turn and twist of these knees here. And we can also see the clear articulation and the lengthening of the leg from the hip flexor all the way down to the pointed of the toe. I would encourage them to think about their arms because they tend to move one arm more than the other. So making sure they have an equal distribution of the arms and that the arm is moving as a reaction to the torso and the ribcage moving. the dancer be kind of begins to use their hips and then kind of cuts it off. So in order to encourage hip articulation throughout the entire dance, I would encourage them to be more grounded and figure out how connecting their hips to their torso and connecting their hips to their feet so it all moves as one unit can create more fluidity in the salsa step.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

It really would help to play this piece, start to finish more to build up the finger strength and endurance towards the end of the piece. For this section of the piece, it would help to isolate the parts and play the left hand for a bit alone just to gain more clarity to the pitches and consistency with tempo. They once again successfully transitioned back to the legato style of playing here. Here you can see the left hand wrist is drooping downward again. It would help to lift the wrist and get it more parallel. There was a bit of difficulty with some of the pitches played in that previous phrase. It would help to work on this phrase at a slower tempo and then incorporate it back with the phrase before it leading into the next phrase of the song to get this transition of the piece to be more seamless. The pianist transitioned both left and right hand to a lower spot on the keyboard with ease for this next section of the piece. Here the pianist is demonstrating great technical accuracy. The left and right hand are playing very different independent parts and the left hand is shifting a lot across up and down the keyboard to play a wider range of notes in this section of the piece. The left hand wrist is continuing to sag once in a while. It would just help to focus on keeping this wrist more lifted and parallel for it to be more comfortable while playing. Here the pianist is playing a few phrases in the piece with right hand alone. They are getting a nice clear delicate sound and you can see the right hand fingers are nice and curved on the keys. Here the left hand is playing chords and holding the chords while the right hand plays the melodic line. So far the pianist playing is very legato or smooth and they are maintaining a steady tempo and accuracy with the pitches played. Here they moved their hand up an octave or eight keys higher to play this same pitch, but in a higher octave and you can hear the entrance is much more smooth and delicate. There is a bit of inconsistency with the tempo in these few phrases. You can see here the right hand fingers are extended so they can cover a wider range of notes. There was a bit of uncertainty with the transition here. It would help to practice a few phrases before this section of the piece leading into this new spot to help the transition be more successful and for the pianist to maintain an even playing speed throughout. Here there was a bit of an abrupt stop to the pianist playing, but overall they really demonstrated great technical proficiency of their instrument, incredible speed to their playing, in particular sections of the piece, and accuracy with pitch and rhythm throughout. Here, an extra key was pressed by the right hand thumb by accident. It would just help to practice this section a little bit at a slower tempo, watching the right hand thumb to make sure it lands on the key that is needed for that particular pitch. Here, the left hand is playing staccato notes or short notes, while the right hand continues to play a challenging melodic phrase. Here a few incorrect pitches were played. It would help to practice these phrases a few more times at a slower tempo. And also, it could also help to just practice the piece, start to finish more for the pianist to gain endurance to make it all the way to the end of the piece successfully. Here the pianist is continuing to demonstrate proper technique when their hands are crossing over one another. Overall, this section has been very consistent in tempo and accurate with pitches and rhythm. Just one pitch here, the lowest pitch played by the left hand pinky, sounded a little bit abrupt. Here, there was the slightest error in pitch played by the right hand. It would help to practice this section of the piece at a slower tempo and gradually speed it back up to tempo to keep it more consistent and even. Here the pianist is demonstrating very delicate soft dynamic levels or volume levels. Here they demonstrated a very graceful hand crossing. The left hand is now in a new spot on the keyboard. The pianist is maintaining great speed and also accuracy with pitch and rhythm throughout this section. Here the pianist is demonstrating excellent technical proficiency of their instrument. They are playing very challenging rhythms. They are shifting around the keyboard to cover a wide span of notes. And they are demonstrating proper hand-crossing technique that is very graceful. The pianist is once performing an accelerando or speeding up and performing this section at a faster tempo. Right away the pianist demonstrated a song hands together. They were playing legato or very smoothly and expressively. Here the pianist is once again playing hands together. The left hand is playing the same melody as the right hand, just an octave lower or eight notes lower. They are getting good synchronization between the hands and maintaining a nice legato smooth sound and accuracy to their pitch and rhythms. Here you can see the left hand fingers are extended to cover an octave or a range of eight notes. Here the pianist returns to their original playing tempo with ease. Here there was the slightest bit of hesitation on one of the pitches. Further practice would help the pianist perform this section more confidently. The hands are now playing independent musical phrases. The pianist is maintaining their technical accuracy in pitch and rhythm so far in this new section. Here the pianist transitioned to the new section of the piece seamlessly. They're playing very fast rhythms in both hands a few seconds prior, and now are playing more smoother legato notes right away. Here the left hand wrist is drooping a bit. I would recommend curving the fingers more and getting a more parallel wrist. Here the pianist is performing a section of the piece with many challenging shorter rhythms and they seem to be performing an accelerando or a tempo that is speeding up faster and faster. The pianist is attempting to perform their starting pitches. You can see that this low E flat key is over responsive. The pianist is not pressing aggressively and it's just making a loud abrupt sound. It's the instrument and not the pianist. Here the pianist is demonstrating great right hand technique. They first played a descending melodic phrase in the right hand at a challenging speed. Just now they were playing two adjacent keys with two different fingers. They were going back and forth between these two pitches at a very challenging speed and still getting a nice clear consistent sound to their playing.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He should also be twisting from his hip a lot. The movement seems that it's mostly his lower leg moving, but he should also be moving his hips as well. The dancer's right arm should be lifted higher here. It's too low on the angle so it would be difficult to see. So he needs to raise his arm. It's okay it's on a diagonal but on a higher diagonal. The dancer doesn't move his arms as far back when he's swinging them in the second jump as he did in the first jump. His second jump shouldn't be compromised in any which way in terms of range of movement compared to his first jump. So his arms therefore should be swinging further backwards. The dancer should have been ending in a strong pose. He was not meant to start a second basic salsa step forward and then what she eventually just fades out of here. After he did a basic salsa step, he should have been finishing in a strong pose of his choosing. That's what the choreography was. So in this sense, he didn't finish strongly or in the way in which he should have. The dancer is doing a good job of rotating his leg inward and also his foot inward. So that's a great range of motion there for his leg from his knee downward. Instead, the dancer should be scooting and jumping backwards with his left foot first. His left foot should replace where his right foot is, and then his right foot should be jumping backwards second. So his left foot should lead backwards, and then his right foot should follow backwards. So instead of both feet going at the same time, he should be jumping left, right, left, right, instead of both feet and both feet. The dancer turns on flat feet with his feet completely on the ground. He should be lifting his heels off the ground when he turns so that he can do the turn quicker and with less friction and be further balanced. The dancer is jumping with both of his feet at the same time backwards. So in this way, like he starts with both feet on the ground, they both enter the air at the same time and land at the same time. That should not be the case. He shouldn't be jumping in this way with two feet to two feet. The dancer should be bending his legs more when he lands from these jumps as a way to soften and cushion the landing. It's also good for injury prevention and it makes the movement bigger as a whole. The dancer has good movement in his shoulder here. He's moving his shoulder vigorously forward and back and shimmying them so that's great.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Now he is ready to serve his milk tea so he grabs his saucer, his spoon, and his serving cup or mug. All that he is missing is a fine mesh sieve to strain the tea leaves from the milk mixture. His flame is high here so that you can see that he is attempting to boil his milk mixture. He will want to gradually reduce that heat or stir the milk mixture in order to prevent it from boiling over. In executing this recipe, you could add the tea first or the sugar first. Those steps are interchangeable. Here he is adding his milk, which appears to be whole milk, into the pot. It is already pre-measured in the cup that he plans to serve his milk tea in. This is an appropriate way to measure the milk tea. However, I would like to see a liquid measuring cup so you know exactly how much you're going to be adding to your pot. Here you can see that he obviously produces this recipe quite frequently because he has a good working knowledge of controlling his heat and stirring the mixture so that it doesn't scald at the bottom or risk boiling over. You can see here that he comes back and adds more black tea leaves, about half of a teaspoon. This is why I always recommend using measuring spoons when you are executing a recipe. Then you're not eyeballing it or guessing at how much actual ingredients you're putting into the recipe. You can see that he cuts the heat up to medium-high to hopefully bring his liquid milk mixture to a simmer. To begin the recipe, he grabs his equipment, which here is a saucepan or pot. As he pours the milk mixture through the sieve into the small cup, you can see that he has an expert knowledge of executing this recipe. This is a very difficult task to do well without spilling the milk all over the saucer. And as you can see here, when he cuts the flame up, the liquid is closer to boiling over. And as he cuts the heat down and gives it a stir, the milk mixture immediately comes down. Here he adds one teaspoon of black tea leaves. This is For this recipe you could add anywhere from a teaspoon up to two tablespoons for the one cup of liquid measure. That is dependent on how much tea flavor that you want, how much caffeine that you want in your milk tea. So that is a personal preference. Next he adds his sweetener, which it appears to be granulated sugar, and he adds two spoonfuls, most likely this is two teaspoons, also an appropriate measurement for this amount of liquid, which appears to be eight ounces.

So he's got a bat hang. So he runs out of feet. Uh, he's got this huge hole. So he's able to use the, the rubber on top of his shoes, kind of toe down on the tops of his toes and catch his feet here. So that way he can kind of hang below and it kind of takes all the way to his arms up. So he's able to kind of just slink down these holds, uh, to finish down below. Here doing a really good job when he's staring at the feet, really looking at where he's placing them. So kind of staying actively engaged on his movements and what he's moving, not just blindly reaching or placing feet. Also it'd be really easy for him to do kind of a, maybe a foot swing. It looks like he's on two good holds. And this is a pretty high foot, like kind of above his waist. So he's doing a good job of walking through and kind of showing that flexibility and better to keep your feet on than swing off and have to re-get your feet onto the wall. You can see he's starting from a relatively good position. The only thing I think I would clean up is this right foot. It looks like it's kind of just hanging out. So it's not really aiding in him going up. It's not maybe taking anything too drastically away from either, but he could just have a little bit more tension there. And that's going to translate to more power up the wall instead of this foot kind of hanging off and kind of pull him away from the wall. So here he kind of cuts feet a little bit, looks like he doesn't really get into position, looks like maybe he gets blinded by the fact that it's a huge hold and just decides to kind of jump for it. And here we can see he's doing a good job getting opposite opposed. So he's got left hand on, right foot on, and he's kind of smearing this left foot into the wall. And that's going to kind of let him dry from that left foot, smear it into the wall and kind of push himself up.

Once again I do like that the head, the chest, the body is moving quite close to where that standing leg is so that helps us really keep the ball down because as we're striking through the ball we're not going to follow through and go up or hit the underside of the ball as we reach for the ball so we're able to really maintain control of the ball in terms of keeping it lower and not raising the ball over the crossbar or too high. So good position, like how the player is also utilising his arms to rotate and maintain his balance as he strikes through the ball. Again, just looking at the outcome, so player is really hitting the target quite consistently. Right leg is returning slightly back behind the left, which means maybe slightly leaning back you can see from his body position after the follow through. But in general, player is hitting his target and being able to move his feet and regain his balance after the strike, which is positive. Again, he's commenting on angle of approach, so you see 45 degree angle, which is what we'd like the player to do. Lighten his feet as he's approaching the ball, looks at his target, then looks down at the ball, fully focused on where he's going to make contact with it to maximise the outcome that he's aiming for. Yn ogystal \u00e2'r ymdrech i'r ball yw ar y cyd, felly os ydyn ni'n dod yn y b\u00f4l, mae'n gysylltu \u00e2'n gweithredaeth y bwys a chwaraewr. Felly mae'n ymdrech iawn i'r chwaraewr atal y ball os ydyn ni'n ei ffwrddio gyda'r pwll dre. Here again, non-kicking foot stepping to the ball. You can see the toe is pointing towards the middle of the goal. This is generally through the angle of approach that he runs. Potentially if we're looking to aim for this left side of the goal, we may want to turn his toe a little bit more. The placement in terms of its relation to the ball is good. It's going to allow us to rotate through the ball and bring the ball back to the left side of the goal. Once again, just comment on the angle of the placement foot through the straight leg, through to the hips and the chest. Really the player is able to open up his hips and chest using his arms for balance out to his side. Again, really maintaining focus on the ball. You can see from his head placement and where his eyes are focused on, we're really maximising on where this right foot is going to strike through the ball, which is what we recommend. ymlaen, felly'n eithaf cyfathrebu gyda'r cyfathrebu o ran y lle y mae'n ei ymwneud \u00e2'r ball i'w mynd, hefyd fel y syniad o ddarlunio'r dyddiadur, felly wrth ei dilyn trwy, yn y dyrfa o'r ball, oherwydd bod y chwaraewr wedi'i ddarlun trwy ei llwybrau a'i byd, mae'n gallu dod yn \u00f4l y llwybrau drech yn ogystal ag y ddrech, heb ymdrechu allan neu ddod yn \u00f4l gyda'r effaith ddiweddar y ball, felly bydd hwn yn helpu'r chwaraewr yn dilyn unrhyw ddarluniau neu'n dilyn unrhyw gweithiau nesaf os yw'n gwneud y dylunio'r targed neu'r gofalwyr. And just looking at final action, outcome is pretty much in the intended area that he was looking to strike. You can see the player is maybe slightly leaning back through the follow through action. So at the next level, potentially as we're striking through the ball, we would be maybe a little bit more up straight, but the player obviously is able to follow through with his right leg and then be able to bring his right leg back alongside his left, which means that the player is not particularly losing too much balance through the strike. So he can maintain the quality and accuracy of how he strikes the ball. and just commenting on the follow-through action you can see here the right leg follows all the way through the ball relatively in the direction that the ball is traveling and this again helps us with power and control you can just see a little bit from the non-placement foot that the player is leaning slightly away to the left and back but the player is very you know in a decent balanced position you can see where his non-kicking foot is in relation to his head and his body relatively in control of what he is looking to do using his arms again to kind of maintain the balance throughout the action Again, just looking at angle of approach. So angle of approach is again at a 45 degree angle based potentially on the outcome as to the target. So he's looking to aim for this left side of the goal. Maybe we can start a little shallower, but the angle is good. It's just gonna really depend now on how we place our non-kicking foot and the ability to rotate our hips through the ball. He's looking at initial placement of the non-kicking foot here, the left foot. You can see because the player is aiming for the left side of the goal, the player's not fully stepping his left foot too far forward because that's going to allow him to really bring his hips around and his right foot around. If anything, maybe his angle of approach could be a little shallower so as he plants his foot, his toe is more pointing in the direction he wants to go. This just allows a little bit more rotation through. But in general, the player's in a decent position, good space between ball and the non-kicking foot. He's adjusting his non-kicking foot to be able to rotate through. Again, I also like this angled position from the standing foot all the way through to the hips, through the chest. And then the next step obviously is bringing his knee forward to bring his body forward. But this initial position, arms out to the side, opens up his hips, opens up his chest. And again, the back leg, the right foot that's going to come through in the back lift is bent and ready to now exercise the strike and come through the ball. and repeating on some of the actions from before you can see as the leg the left leg plants to the ground it was straight but as he brings the right leg through you can see the knee start to bend and move towards the ball which brings us a little bit closer to the ball and in control you can see again because of the angle of approach coming from there it's easy for the player to open up his hips bring his right leg through bend his knee present the inside surface of the ball and you can see the player is making contact generally with the middle of the ball and striking through the the center of the foot which maximizes the control that we have and would like to see the player on contact with his body slightly further forward you can see the player is leaning back slightly so this means that with our contact is just maybe gonna go through and up which is potentially going to bring the ball higher or we're not going to maximize the contact with the ball for the cleanliness and accuracy of the strike ac edrychwch ar y canlyniad penodol, felly mae'r chwaraewr yn dod at y targed yn eich ardal ymwneud \u00e2d, a gallwch weld bod y chwaraewr yn ymdrech yn ymdrech, nid yn ychydig, mae'n dod \u00e2'i gwaeth i'w gydnabod i ddod allan i ddod allan i ddod allan i'w gydnabod ei gydnabod, felly, yn unol, yn dda iawn, seqwenaeth o weithiau o'r chwaraewr hon. Again you see here as the player has made contact and follows through you can see quite clearly as the player strikes the ball you can see his leg really follows through in the direction he intends the ball to go. This maximises the control that we can have over the ball because we are striking straight through the ball rather than just making contact and withdrawing our leg. Also generates more power from the backswing to the follow through. I do also like as the player is making contact you can see his left leg again has gone from that straight position bending his knee forward which then brings his body closer to the contact point with the ball. So this maintains a little bit better balance also means that his body momentum is now going forwards as opposed to leaning back which can help us keep the ball at a lower trajectory rather than the ball going high. I also like to see the standing foot so where the ball was to where the head is you can see the head is close to the direction of where the ball was so that just means that we are able to maintain balance and control over the shot. I just want to comment here. So obviously the outcome is the ball hitting the inside of the goal to the right. So the outcome of the goal is positive. What I do like is from the players follow through, the player shows that he's maintained his balance through the action because he's able to bring his right leg back alongside his left with no real problem and maintain his balance after the shot. So this means as the player is moving through the action, he's in good control. He's got good balance with his non-kicking foot for the ability to be able to bring that striking leg, the right leg back down to the ground easily. On contact with the ball, you'll see that the standing leg, the left leg starts to bend. So it goes from a straight leg and then bending forward into the shot. This allows the player to be mobile and agile as he strikes through the ball, get lower through the ball. You'll see that the right leg is turning to present the inside foot to the ball and he's striking through the middle to low part of the ball. He's standing for his toe, he's still pointing in that direction. So based on the contact with the ball, the standing leg, where the hips are facing, we obviously are looking to hit this inside right of the goal. You'll see that the player is still slightly leaning back. This is from the placement of the non-kicking foot being slightly behind the ball. So we do end up reaching a little bit as we make contact with it. Again looking at the follow through action, so again players in a good position, got good balance between his plant foot, you can see his body has moved forward, so slightly behind the plant foot, so maybe slightly further forward would be ideal, but again you can see the follow through action with the right leg is very much going through the line of the ball into the intended direction that we want the shot to go, so the player is in a good position maximising control and power. Again, just looking at the outcome of the penalty, so you can see that the player, based on everything that we presented with the non-kicking foot, the hip placement at the end of the shot, the follow-through, the ball is reaching its intended target. You can also see that the player's right leg, after the follow-through, returns back alongside his body. Because he was slightly leaning back, you can see his right leg has gone back behind, so a little bit of momentum going forward, the ball was lost, but generally, because he's able to bring his right leg back alongside his left, the player shows good balance through the action during the strike. Just looking at the contact point between the player's right foot and the ball, you can see as the player brings his right leg towards the ball that his left leg goes from being in this straight position to then bending his knee to bring his body closer to the ball. Also see that the player's right leg, based on the angle of approach, is able to really open up his hips, get this knee bend in his right leg, open up his body shape so he's able to present the inside foot to the ball. By using the inside surface of the foot with the ball maximises the surface area, potentially can give us more control as we're looking to create accuracy with the shot. You'll see the non-kicking foot is still pointing in this direction and his hips have rotated through in the same direction as his standing foot, which is good. So everything is really directing to the ball, heading towards the right side of the goal as we look at it. Also like as he strikes the ball, you can see his arms are out away from his body so this provides him some extra balance as he strikes through the ball. Again, just maximising outcome, so hitting the inside side netting of the goal. So outcome is positive, you can see again the player is slightly leaning off to the left, having to bring his right leg back behind his left as he strikes. So maybe a little imbalance after the follow through, nothing too significant, but again if we can potentially move through in the direction of the ball, this may be generating more power and also allow us to set up for potential rebounds in a game if a goalkeeper makes a save, if he hits the post, so we potentially look for the next action. Here I like now that the player is turning his left foot slightly away from centre so it's pointing slightly more towards the left. This is going to really help with his whole rotation of his hips through the ball and his follow through action. So you can see he's in a good position. Again, distance between the ball and the foot is good, maybe slightly more can open up a little bit more room but not a big problem. Love the angle of the body from the straight leg planting to the ground, hips open, chest open. Again, using his arms as balance to really open up wide and that allows that flexibility and mobility of his whole body to come through the ball. Again, the back lift is good with the right leg bent, getting his foot set in a position to now come and rotate through the ball. Again, very focused in on the ball which is going to help us really maximise the contact point. And just looking at angle of approach, so we see this 45 degree angle that the player is moving towards the ball. Focus is very much on the ball. Player positioning himself in an area where he can now move towards the ball step and rotate his hips through in the direction that he would like to make the shot. So he's looking at the placement of the non-kicking foot based on the direction the player would want to go. So non-kicking foot, because the player is now looking to come across his body to the left of the goal, you can see that the left foot places and now turns more towards the left than originally pointing towards the right. So he's trying to provide a different direction and open up his hips more to come back to the left. Because he's coming across his body, it's natural that the foot will be placed slightly behind the front part of the ball. So this is a good position because this is going to now allow our hips to rotate more through the ball and come around to the left. And I do like the position of the player from the straight leg on the initial placement. You can see he's really opening up his chest, his arms are out to the side. This is going to give him the freedom to really rotate his hips through the ball and get as much power and control on the strike as possible. See the contact point with the inside of the right foot with the ball. Non-kicking leg, you can see there's a slight bend, so he's gone from that straight leg position to bending in, which brings the body closer to the ball. We are still leaning slightly back. This is partly due to the player's placement foot and really trying to open up his hips to turn to get the ball travelling in this direction over to the left. You can also see that the player is making the adjustment on the angle of the inside of the foot to make contact with not the direct centre of the ball, but the position of the ball slightly off-centre to the right, so then he can really follow through in that line in the direction that he wants to go. I just want to look at the follow-through action. Once again you can see the player is well balanced through the plant foot, the left leg bending, bringing his body relatively straight upright from that plant leg. The follow-through leg, so he strikes the ball with the right leg, you can see that the player follows through pretty much in the direction he intends the ball to go. This again generates good power from the back lift to the follow-through, also adds extra quality control in terms of accuracy because it means that we are striking all the way through the ball, not making contact with the ball and then stopping. So it generates more control to help direct the position of the ball. I do like that the player's focus is very much on moving forward through the shot. This is just going to help him maintain his balance and to keep the ball from going too high during the strike. So looking at the follow through action, so you can see again the player is aiming for the left side of the goal and you can quite clearly see the striking leg, the right leg follows all the way through the contact point of the ball and in towards the intended direction of where he wants the ball to go. Again the only thing potentially is the obviously non-kicking foot was slightly turned more to the middle of the goal as opposed to the left. So to get the ball coming all the way to the left side of the goal, the player is now really rotating his hips around and that brings our right leg across our left slightly, which will lead to maybe the player leaning slightly off to the left. But I do like again the body position, the head position in terms of the standing foot, the player is maintaining decent balance and control as he follows through the strike and the head is in a good position for him to be able to really control the velocity and the angle of how he follows through the ball. And just emphasizing angle of approach to the ball is important. So if we can get this 45 degree angle towards the ball, that's going to help in terms of stepping to the ball, getting our hips rotating through and opening up our chest to strike the ball. Again we just look at the outcome so outcome is top corner pretty much inconsistent with where he's been looking to strike. Again just want to look at his balance after the strike so you can see the player is leaning away and slightly back. He's going to regain his balance because his footwork is good, brings his right foot back but if we can get some slight variations we can get the player hopefully moving more in balance and more in line with the strike of the ball. Again, contact point with the ball on the right foot. So you see the left leg has gone from this straight position, bending the left knee as he makes contact with the right leg. This allows the player to move forward through the ball. The angle of approach and the way that he presents himself to the ball allows him to open up his hips, present the inside of his right foot through the center of the ball. And we can again see the non-kicking foot pointing towards the intended direction he wants the ball to go. Hips are facing in the intended direction he wants the ball to go. Inside foot facing the direction of the intended target. So the player is kind of in a very good position to maintain a control and quality over the shot to go. It's looking at final outcome of the shot so again intended target outcome is good. You will see as the right leg follows through and then comes back you can see it goes back behind the left leg. This again is just a result of the player slightly leaning back so as we strike the ball in this direction I'd like to see the player moving his body more kind of in line and forwards through the shot as opposed to striking through and leaning back but just a slight nuance in the shooting technique. The outcome is good, the balance of the player is good again because he's able to bring his right leg back alongside his left and maintain balance so just a little small nuance with the position of the body leaning back slightly. You see the player is planting his non-kicking foot closer in line with the ball than the previous one. This will just generally allow for the player to really be able to strike through the middle of the ball. So the standing foot is good. Maybe a little bit more space between the left foot and the ball will just allow for a little bit more rotation through. But based on the direction the player wants the ball to go, you can see the toe pointing towards the right, hips facing in that direction. It's not too much of a problem by being that close with the technique the player has. What I do also like is as the player steps towards the ball, you can see that the body is in a relatively straight line from the kicking foot to the chest, leaning slightly back on an angle. So this is a good position for the player to really open up his chest, open up his hips and bring the striking leg, the right leg, back before he starts to now execute through the ball. I also like that the player's focus has shifted from the goal to now getting his head and his eyes focused on the ball. So now we can maximise the contact point between the foot and the ball before striking. Again, just commenting on the angle of approach, so again, an angle of approach is good. So we wanna be on that 45 degree type angle just to allow us to really step alongside the ball. And then this allows us to really open up our hips and rotate our hips through the line of the ball with our striking leg in this place, the right foot. Also, I like the player's focus. After looking at the goal is now right back on the ball and getting his body moving in the direction. The change for the player as he is looking to strike the ball to the left of the goal as we look at it. So now the rotation of the hips goes a little further around to the left so he is trying to rotate it into the direction he wants the ball to go. You can also see the position of the kicking foot, the right leg, so he is now on a slight angle hitting slightly off centre to bring the ball around to the left as opposed to striking straight through the line. If you strike straight through the line obviously the ball is going to go more to the middle of the goal so you can see the adjustment in the body position. You can see that the left leg, the standing leg, is bending in but because the player is looking to open up to the left the player is now still slightly leaning back as he goes through to try and open up his body to get the ball moving to the left. So we would want the body to maybe move slightly further forward despite him trying to open it up just so he is more in line with the position of the ball. So here you see the player is now changing his intended outcome to the left side of the goal but you'll see that there's no genuine change in his angle of approach. It's maybe a little shallower but we're still approaching the ball from an angle which is what we'd like to see. Again this allows the placement foot to go alongside the ball and will just allow us to open up our hips, open up our chest to be able to rotate our hips through the ball. And just commenting on the angle of approach, 45 degrees. Only thing potentially is if we are looking to strike the ball to the left, there is a potential that we could maybe shallow the angle a little bit, maybe start a little bit straight to the ball. This just allows us maybe to plant our foot a little bit more turn towards that direction so we can really strike straight through as opposed to coming across the ball. So just looking at the player's starting position in terms of approaching the ball to strike. So you'll see that the player is working on an angle to the ball. So by not coming straight onto the ball, this will allow the player to step into the ball and be able to rotate his hips more freely through the direction of the shot. And just looking at a follow-through action, so as the player follows through straight in the direction of the intended target, which is obviously this area of the goal, to the right of the goal inside the right post as we look at it, you can see that the player now is getting into a well-balanced position as his left leg bends and comes forward. And as he follows through, he brings his body more up straight so that body momentum is helping transfer into the ball. But you can see a good follow-through action in the direction that he wants to go, and then using his arms as well to maintain balance as he goes forward and through the ball. You see again the players initial placement of the plant foot is in a good position. You can see the toe and the heel effectively lining up with the front and the back of the ball. So this is obviously from a dead ball situation where the ball is from a stationary position, not a moving position. So this is a good placement for the non-kicking foot. A little bit more room potentially between the ball and the foot can allow for a little bit more freedom to strike through but the player has good technique so it doesn't make a huge amount of difference. You can see the non-kicking foot is pointing in the direction that he wants to go. This also controls the direction of the hips in the follow through through the ball. You can see again the player has a good angle from his plant leg as he makes contact with the ground to his chest, opening up his chest, arms coming out to the side to maintain balance and really open up his chest and hips to strike through the ball. Again you can see the right leg preparing to come through the ball, so swinging back, knee bent and then we're really focused down on the ball and this is going to maximise our ability to make good contact as we strike the ball. Again, just looking at the preparation of the ball strike, so the non-kicking foot stepping to the ball. You can see the toe is pointing more central, so if the player is intending to aim over to the left, we potentially would want to maybe turn it slightly more in that direction. This just allows for that rotation of the hips to come through into the direction that we want it to go. Sometimes between the foot and the ball, we can maybe open up just slightly more, just for that more mobility and freedom through it. But in general, the position of the player, plant foot, straight leg, hips and chest open, using his arms for balance out to his side, striking leg bent and back in the back lift to be able to follow through in the direction of the ball. Everything's in a relatively good position as we set ourselves up. Again, just looking at contact. So here the player is bending his left knee into the strike. You can see that the player is leaning back slightly from the contact point with the ball to the body to the placement of the head. So we'd want the body to maybe be a little further forward in line with the initial placement of the ball just to maximize the power and the momentum that we generate through the ball. The player here is very much controlling the direction of the pass, utilizing the inside of the foot, placement of the non-kicking foot, rotation and final placement of the hips as he strikes through the middle of the ball to goal. So the player is not really struggling for matching the outcome based on leaning back slightly. But if we want to maintain full balance and control, I would like to see him maybe slightly further forward as he strikes through the ball. Once again, just looking at the angle of approach for the player to strike the dead ball. So you see that the player is approaching the ball from a slight angle to the side. What this allows the player to do is step alongside the ball and it allows the player to freely rotate his hips and his striking leg through the ball which will generate more control and more power. So the player, I also like, is making contact and looking at where he is intending to strike the ball. So he's assessing the situation and then his head will come back down to the ball before he makes contact. We just want to look at the placement of the non-kicking foot as it lands next to the ball. You can see again it's relatively, let me just clear that one, clear. So the toe is relatively close to the front of the ball, heel slightly back, so maybe a couple of inches further forward would be better. We'd recommend a little bit more space between the non-kicking foot and the ball. This just allows for that ease of movement of the striking leg here, the right leg through the ball. But in general the player is going to open up his hips and strike the ball through. I like the position of the body in the initial phase, so straight leg, body is starting to lean to come forward but he's opening up his chest, opening up his hips. So that's a good position, good visual for you. And then the striking leg you can see is now as he plants his left leg, starts to come back, bending the knee, which is now going to help him rotate through the ball. And his focus is very much on the ball, which is going to help maximise the contact point between the right foot and the ball. and it's looking at the follow-through action for the player so the player strikes the ball, ball is traveling on upwards directory based on the contact point with the inside foot and the ball probably slightly lower than center you can see the direction and the power of the shot very much helped and controlled by that follow-through action you can see the the right leg following through kind of in that direction of the intended target of the ball and the players continues to really rotate his hips through the ball which is going to help the ball potentially spin a little bit more towards the the post in inside of the goal you can see the player is slightly leaning away from the ball his left foot was a little close to the ball as he strikes it so he's really exaggerating that hip rotation to come through the ball which is forcing his body to lean away and slightly back I would maybe look to recommend that we try and get our body as upright and moving forwards in the same direction as ball if possible because if we're leaning away that maybe affect our next action in a game situation if the ball hits the post or the goalkeeper makes a save Again, just looking at the follow-through action for the strike. So the player has approached the ball, made contact with the ball and now you can see that the non-kicking foot is still pointing a little straight. So you can see here the right leg striking the ball is really following through in the direction that he intends the ball to go. But his right leg is starting to come across the line of his left leg. This is due to the initial placement of the non-kicking foot. If we turn that slightly more we can maybe reduce this crossover effect a little bit. It doesn't affect this player's outcome, he still hits the target with decent control and power. But you can see because he's now coming across his body with his right leg, the body is now starting to lean away to the left. So I would recommend that as we strike the ball we want to try and get as much of our body moving through the line of the ball as possible to generate the most amount of power. I do like that the player's body and head you can see is very much in line with the non-kicking foot. So that does mean that he's moving his body momentum forward and through so we are getting good control and power over the strike. Again, just looking at contact, again we go from this straight leg to bending the left knee into the strike. Again, this just helps us bring our body slightly closer to the line of the ball. You can see the non-kicking foot is maybe slightly turning back more towards the centre, but the player is obviously angling his right foot at striking the ball, so he's able to now hit through the line of the ball in the intended direction that he wants to go. So he's in a decent position, locked ankle, knee bent, getting his body kind of towards the ball, helping him with the contact with it. You can see his hips are starting to turn, which will help him maintain that final direction of the shot. What we do like here in terms of the follow-through action, you'll see as the player strikes the ball with the inside of the foot, the player brings his leg all the way through in the same direction as he wants the ball to travel. So this allows, the follow-through allows to generate more power and also more control because it means that we are striking genuinely through the ball rather than making contact with the ball and stopping and relying solely on the contact point with the ball. I do like that the player's momentum with his body through this bent leg allows the body to become a little bit closer in line with the contact of the ball. So he's being able to shift his body weight through the strike as opposed to leaning back. And this also will help us keep the ball a little bit lower rather than allowing the ball to travel higher by reaching for the ball and hitting a lower contact point. He's looking at the initial placement of the non-kicking foot. Again, we'll see the toe and the heel are pretty much in line with the front and back of the ball respectively. So this is an ideal position. His initial step, you'll see that he maintains this straight leg, straight body type of position, which is what we like to see in striking the ball. You can see his arms are out to his side, which is just opening up his chest, opening up his hips. This allows for good rotation through the ball with the right leg. As he plants his left foot alongside the ball, we've got good distance between. We can see the right leg with the back lift here, knee bent. So this just allows us the flexibility to now strike through the ball. I also like that the player's focus, you can see with his vision, is very much on the ball, which again is going to maximise contact between foot and the ball as we strike through it. and it's looking at the contact point with the ball. So you can see because of the placement of the non-kicking foot being quite, looking more pointing towards the middle, we have to adjust our contact point between the inside of the foot and the ball. So we're hitting it slightly off-center to the right so we can follow through in the direction that we want the ball to go. Because he's coming across his body, you can see that the body is leaning slightly backwards and away from the ball. That's in his attempt to really open up his hips and get the ball traveling to the left. So as we step into these strikes, we'd like that left knee to bend and to potentially bring the body a little bit closer to the line of the ball. So a little bit further forward than where we are right now. And this can be dictated by the placement of the non-kicking foot, the angle of it, the distance of it from the ball, just to help our body move through the strike at the end. Here the player approaches the ball and plants his left leg as he's striking the ball with the right leg, plants his left leg to the side of the ball. Normally I would recommend the player places his foot closer to the line of the ball so that the toe is in line with the front of the ball, the heel with the back, especially from a dead ball position. So foot's a little further back than the ball than we would potentially like, maybe a little close to the ball. You'll see the direction that the toe is pointing in is towards the inside right of the goal, so that's the intended target and this will allow the player's follow through to move through in that direction. You'll also see that the player's body shape is relatively straight from leg through to his chest. By having this kind of structure in place with the body allows the player to open up his hips and be able to strike through the ball with good rotation. Again, just looking at outcomes, so players hitting his intended target to the left of the goal as we look at it. You can see the final position of the body is slightly leaning back and to the side, he's having to bring his right leg back behind his left to regain that little bit of balance that maybe we lose due to the placement foot and knee follow through crossing over a little bit over to the left. So if we can get the placement foot correct then hopefully we can bring our body through the ball and be able to regain our balance with our feet shoulder width apart together.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This keeping this right side against the wall is important and key as for the climber will have an easier time when reaching upright to the next hold. The right hand is placed as a pinch, meaning that the fingers are in one side and the thumb is pressed on the other. The climber will be able then to generate power by pressing on that thumb and leaning on the hold in order to sustain it. Now the left foot as he was going up for the reach was the one that he was using to stand up and after the hand is being placed and the right foot will lose touch with the foothold. In this case it's important that the climber knows how to place his feet correctly. The left foot was then placed on top of the big edge, this one where the climber can completely put his foot against it. But in this one the climber is generating power where he slides slightly out and it's mostly relying on the ankle area. Here the climbers are starting at a two hand hold start. Once the climber gets to place the feet on the wall and is no longer standing on the mat and once he gains a secured position then the climb will start. As we can see the type of hold that the climber is brushing off with the chalk sock is because he's trying to bring the integrity of the hold back. And this because over time the holds will collect sweat and chalk that will be compressed onto the hold. So he does the brushing to take away anything that has been collected on the pores as well as applying chalk onto the hold. This so that he's able to sustain a better grip. The climber was able to reach the left hand up to the next hold while engaging on the pull. When the climber needed to apply force onto the foot down below, the left foot has slipped off from the hold. This was due to the poor placement of the left foot. The climber originally has placed the outer edge of the foot, thus distributing the weight over the entire edge of the foot, which was not accurate as climbers are able to shift their weight and apply pressure, mostly relying on the toe box. In this case, the climber has slipped out of the hold because once they brought the knee into the wall, the foot had rotated inwards and resulted the slip out of the hold. It's important the climber when making placement of the feet he glances down at the foot that is being positioned. In this case the climber glanced over to make a left foot placement to an edge that sticks out and places the outer edge of the foot against the hold. This you will have to create pressure by pressing down on the hold. As we can see the climber is placing his hands into two different holes, the right hand being a sloper, meaning that the climber will have to place the right hand open handed and create friction by placing the fingertips and leaning on the hold in order to sustain pressure on it. On the left hand, we can see that the climber is staying to a jug, meaning that there is a positive entrance for the climber to place the fingers behind it and the climber will be able to sustain pressure by closing the grip, placing himself below and pulling on the hold by curling the fingers.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Again, his follow-through is really high. You know, we want that follow-through to be in this, in the ego view here. We should be able to see this arm laid out here. Better going up on the balls of the feet. I still love to see him jump and use more legs. Here's the shot. Again, this looks really nice. See that guide hand? It's kind of almost... It's not on top of the ball. It was on the side, but then he pulls it back toward him and up. We just need it to stay down and to stay in place. It doesn't really move. Good extension. Love to see him jump. I love his... He's square to the basket. This looks really nice. Here's again, the shooting arm is not so bad. It looks, actually looks pretty good here. Maybe elbow in a tad. I like the snapping of the wrist. Again, get this guide arm down. We don't want it coming across the body. Good extension. We'd love to see him get off the ground here. A lot of his shots are hitting the front of the rim. That tells me he needs more lower body, more legs, more power. Again, his follow-through does bend the knees a little bit, a lot better. But see, his follow-through is straight up. It needs to be more arced, like following this basketball to the rim. See his follow-through, it's way up high. Could throw off the spin of the ball as it makes its way to the basket. Here, he's got a follow through that's really high, because you can't even see his follow through. You should be able to see his follow through in this picture. His follow through is really high. He probably has way too much arc on the ball. And then he kind of locks it out, flat-footed. My suggestion is follow the, that your arm should be bent, or you know, following the ball to the basket. Drop, being real light on the hips and knees and feet. Go to Beadaholique.com for all of your beading supply needs! Here again, then he pauses. I mean, he's going to be defended. In a game, you don't have time to do all that. If it is a free throw, I like how his feet are set, one foot in front of the other. That right foot's in front because he's a right-hand shooter. He drops his hips a little. He takes a deep breath, I'm sure, looks at the target. Again, if this is a free throw, it looks really nice. You know, knees are bent, staggered stance. He's dropping his hips, eyeing his target. That ball's out in front. His vision takes his eyes over on top of the ball, across to the rim. But in a game, if this is a jump shooting drill, like a jump shot, you don't have time to do all this. You've got to catch and shoot before this defender guards you. Here's his shot. Pretty good. Maybe right elbow in a little bit. I love how it comes off the pads of these fingers. Again, let's drop that left elbow and get that hand should be more over here facing in. He goes up on the balls of his feet. We'd love to see him get off the ground and lift his body up. Here's the shot. Again, good extension of the elbow. Maybe just get that right elbow in a little bit. I love the follow-through, snapping of the wrist, fingers are down. This guide arm needs to come in. It's just really high and across the body. You know, we just want to keep that elbow bent. It really doesn't do anything. All its work is helping get the ball up to where you want to release it. Good extension of the hips. Free throw would be great going up on the balls of the feet, but overall I think he really needs to use a lot more of his legs. Here the shooter is shooting a 15-foot jump shot. It looks like he's shooting a free throw, so, because he's not jumping, he took two dribbles. Yeah, I don't know if it's a, if it is a free throw, that's okay. You don't need to jump. You don't need, you could take one or two dribbles because you have 10 seconds to shoot the basketball. But in the jump shooting drill, we need to jump, and I would love to see him use his legs more to lift this ball to the basket. You know, the ball coming off his shooting arm and hand, not too bad. I get this right elbow in a tad. I love this, how it comes off these pads of the fingers. The left arm maybe coming across the body a little bit too much. You see that hand. We'd love that elbow to be bent, that forearm parallel, that palm of that left non-shooting hand facing the other arm. I can't tell if he's using it in his shot, but it does come across his body here. Again, here's a shooting hand behind the ball that looks good. I just think this guide arm, we need some work with the guide arm. We need to drop this elbow, but the hand comes off. It just comes off. He pulls it back, it looks like, instead of just letting the hand be, and the ball just kind of shoots through that hand. But I love the 90 degree, good body control. Again, I love to see him step into a pass one time and jump. Not bad snapping of the wrist, maybe point those fingers, maybe the right elbow comes in a tad. Again, let's get this left shooting, non-shooting arm down. Good extension here. Goes up on the balls of his feet. Again, if this is a free throw, this technique looks good. But if it's a game like, you've got to get off the ground and shoot over this defender. Again, he begins his shot. He does have his left hand here on the side, maybe a little looser grip here. You don't want your left non-shooting guide hand to grip the basketball. Just real light, soft pressure. But I like that. I like bending the knees, dropping the hips. He's got that ball sitting on that right hand, that elbow's 90 degree, and he's looking over the rim, over the ball at the rim. Again, here's the shot on a free throw, going up on the balls of the feet is nice, but again, if it's a jump shooting drill, we need to use more legs and get more power and lift, jump, but not bad here. Again, that left hand comes across. We need to keep it down in here. Your guide arm really is not in the shot. It just stays there, the elbow bent, balancing the ball in this hand. Again, you know, if this is a free throw, this is fine, but if it's a jump shooting drill, it needs to be more like game-like, catch and shoot. You don't have time to dribble it and look down at it. See how he's looking down? When you look down, you take your eyes off your target. It's so important to maintain eye contact with your target instead of staring at the basketball. My suggestion is don't dribble, catch and shoot as quick as possible before you're defended.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And the climber attempts to pull into this tufa hold here and gets around it but just is not able to actually utilize the usable surface of the hold. That's probably because they're feeling uncomfortable on this left hand pinch. I don't know this climber, maybe they're not, maybe pinches are not part of their repertoire, but nevertheless they get the reach but not quite the usable surface here and then they fall off the boulder.

However, this is difficult for her because her right foot being in place keeps her right side close to the wall so it makes it a lot more lengthy to send the left hand up for the reach. Reason why she is not able to wrap her fingers above the edge of the hold. Now the left leg is not positioned into any foot chips and instead is extended. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. We can see the climber bringing her right knee in and doing a twist of her body to send her center of gravity over to the right as she was planning to release the right hand to go up to the next hold. The climber making hand gestures is so that she's able to visualize the holds on the route as performing hand placements and how the body will need to move when at that section of the wall. The climber keeping her right side being the right hand and the right foot being in place towards the wall was applying a lot of force to send the left hand out for the reach. This is because the climber is forcing her center of gravity over to the opposite direction making it impossible to make the holder reach and she has done this dynamically where she had engaged onto the right foot bringing her center of gravity close to the wall on the opposite direction where her left hand was going to and has engaged onto forcefully twisting her left shoulder so that she was able to bring her hand up for the reach. This actually can apply a lot of force onto the right shoulder making it tired so the climber has come off the wall and sit on the mat and didn't climb. The climber chooses to retract from almost performing the move, sending the right hand up while bringing the hip over to the right side and retracts the move to perform a foot switch. It's important that the climber always glances down when performing a new foot placement or doing a foot switch. Where she has brought the right toe to come close to where her left foot is And she's performing a common technique of foot switching where she jumps off the left toe out of place to bring the right toe to jump where the left toe was, being placed above the foothold. This is a method or technique of foot switching that is the most commonly used and it works but at times it's really hard to make the placement accurate, especially in a small foothold. At the same time, this takes a fair bit of energy when being performed. The climber is starting at a one-hold start where she places both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching. And now we can see how she is ascending to the lip of the hold. With a slight indent into the hold, the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold. And to apply extra pressure, the climber secures the grip by placing the thumbs at the bottom of it to squeeze the hold. After she has secured the grip, we can see how the climber was able to transfer over the weight, keeping the arms extended and pulling onto the hold. As she brings her feet onto a rise, where she places the left foot slightly lower on the wall and brings the right foot over a distance to be pushed away. Now the climber, in pushing down the feet, she is able to raise the hips and is glancing over at the next hold at reach. The climber starts when the climber is no longer standing on the mat.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It's a doable move, but there's a couple ways they're making this harder on themselves already. This hand is on the far outside edge of the hold, so they're losing already like, you know, eight inches of space that they could get closer to. They can really turn the left hip in as they reach through. This is a much more distant way of doing the move. It's definitely easier to go through the intermediate hold, but if they're going to go for the big move, they can actually do it more efficiently as well.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

In this one the climber brings the left foot that was out in space as a flag to come and join at the lip down below which he's ascending on another jug. This one the climber will apply pressure of the left foot towards the edge of the hold in order to release the right foot from its place. The climber right now, coming into a match, he's leaning back by extending the arms, keeping the core tight as well as dropping the left foot to stabilize himself from moving. The climber, in order to reach the hold upright, he had pressed the left toe that was extended as a flag in order for him to have stabilized the move and stay in place once making the reach. This will help the climber to push his center of gravity close to the wall to keep the hips square when making up the reach, as well as helped by the left hand when the climber brought it close to his chest to lock the move in order to send the right hand up. Now the right hand, we can see the entrance of the climber making the hand placement would be on to the right, so he's going to place the fingers behind the lip of that hold and must sustain onto the grip by leaning out left. The climber was able to make the hold that reach and it's important that he always glances down at the feet to make sure that he makes an accurate placement of the foot coming into place. This time the climber brings the right toe to come towards the edge of the hold and in doing so the climber then will transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place. We can see how the climber had made a dynamic move to the right hand making it up for the jug at reach. This one has a large lip where the climber can place the fingertips behind the edge of that hold and able to close the grip he then transfers over the weight to the highest grip as he keeps the arm extended. The clumber is in this place in the left foot. We can see him bringing the hips to rise and pushing down on the right foot to bring himself over to the left side and quickly transitions the right hand over to the next grip, bringing both hands into the same hold. This is called matching. And he's sustaining into a positive hold due to being able to wrap the fingers behind the edge of the hold. The climber is bringing both of the hands to come into a match at the jug in front of him and engages onto a slight pull up to bring his right foot over to be pressed against the wall. This is called smearing when he uses the surface of the wall as a foothold and will be pressing onto it so that the climber can commit to a dynamic move which is to a hold at reach. The climber lowers his center of gravity or keeps tight on the grips and whenever he's ready he will pull himself even harder and boost over with the left foot being in place against the wall. Eventually when the climber gains height he will be transferring over the weight to the highest foot being in place, the right foot. And the left leg will be extended being this time positioned as a flag which means that the climber will be able to balance over his right foot and continue to have a stability over the move when making the reach. Here the climber had kept the hips square, standing over the highest foot and pulling himself up by locking the left arm to make the reach of the jug with the right hand. And then quickly we can see the climber is dropped the right foot, extending the leg. This is called flagging out. The climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. And at this moment the climber is about to release the left hand from its place to bring it over to the next move. When making this move the climber will push down onto that left foot being in place and keep the right leg extended to balance over the move as he continues to make the reach. The climber, after performing the foot switch, he actually made a right foot placement at a higher stance and then quickly moved the left foot also to be placed much higher. Now the climber's center of gravity is laying low when he brought his left hand to come into position where the right hand is, again matching to a jug. Now the climber is glancing over to the next hold, which the climber then keeping the arms extended. This is called the rest position as the arms are not engaged on the bend. So in this moment, the climber can take a moment to rest before moving on, as well as taking the time to assess the wall. The climber quickly sends the left foot to come into a high foot placement which he uses to push away in order to make the transition of the right hand coming over to the last hold. The climber is using a chalk bucket. This contains the chalk. It's a powder that the climber will use to spread out through the surface of the hands in order to gain a better grip when sustaining the holds on the wall. It also helps the climber to absorb any sweat that may be coming from his hands. As the climber made the transition of the right hand over to a jug that's on to the side, he is now releasing the left hand and the left foot is already out in space. So in this moment, the climber will be bar enduring out to the right. So in order for the climber to stop this, he must try to bring the center of gravity underneath his area of support by sending the left foot over to the right and dropping the foot as he brings the left hand to come into place at the match. When the climber had made the right foot placement, we can see his left foot was no longer in contact as he continued to push down on the right foot, gaining height to bring the left hand up to a match. The climber needs to hang on tight to the grips, this will release some of the pressure down at the feet as he commits into a foot switch. Now the climber must bring the left toe to come into place at the hold and applies pressure before releasing the right toe from its place. He needs to also continue to apply pressure down at the feet to avoid him losing the foot placement. The climber is sending the left hand over to a match at the last hold. We can see the climber continues to press onto the left toe to have it in place as he extends the left leg. He does this because he needs to bring his center of gravity underneath his area of support being at the match. Once the climber is able to demonstrate control and stability over the move, then the climb is completed. Since the climbers next hold was one at distance, the climber has then transitioned to press the right foot to extend the left leg. This is called flagging out because it helps the climber to also keep balance over the move. In this case, having the left leg extended, he can balance over the right foot being in place to send the right hand up for a reach and also helps the climber to keep his hips square while engaging on the pull. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start and he's placing the fingers behind the edge of the hold in which indents down onto the wall. Now the climber is starting at a sit start and sit starts are difficult to come off from as it adds a grade to the climb due to the climber having to lift up his weight to transfer it over to the hands and feet. The climber right now is placing his right foot onto the wall and once the climber gets to place the left foot onto the wall and presses down on the feet he will be able to raise his hips off the mat and that's when the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So it looks like maybe this first hold is a little hard to grab. One it's kind of awkward because it's enclosed so you have to grab it pretty specifically. And two, his starting position is kind of unique. He's got both his hands close together on this pinch and this crimp. So he's going to have to be really actively engaged. This is going to be a route that's going to be really important to drive through the feet on but also get into a good position so you can really load up onto this hold. From the looks of it, it looks like he has to match in it. So one, being accurate enough to hit the hold, but two, being accurate and having enough forethought to hit it in a way that you can match it is going to be very important. And so he's able to kind of get this pretty scrunched high foot, uh, hand foot match here. So he loads that up. Um, and now, you know, he's kind of opposite pose because he's left hand right foot. Uh, but as he attempts to match it, you'll see that he's having a hard time getting that right hand in. Um, and the moment he does he's going to kind of utilize the technique maybe like a backflip to balance out. Um, in fact as he's kind of switching this, um, this would probably be the time to kind of tension up so lightly holding it as he is kind of sink into that position and then try to match. Um, because right now you'll see he wrestles with it as he was wrestling with it.

A lot of younger musicians tend to slide their finger around to find the pitch as opposed to replacing it. A replacing strategy ensures that the placement of the finger is practiced, not the pitch of the note that is practiced. And so this is a high quality technique of practice. A recommendation for this type of practice, even though it stayed slow and they're changing between all of the arpeggios, is actually trying to do the arpeggios a little faster now that they have the hand frame. I would do that in sections, first octave, second octave, third octave, and seeing if they can improve the speed at which they can achieve this intonation. Just before they play a third finger on the way down, that first finger tends to pop out like this. This is indicative of some excess tension when they reach for that first finger. I would advise practicing keeping that finger down while playing that third finger. Musician also looks really good. Not the best seating option for taller individuals but you can see that this person is on the shorter side is lifting their their feet here. Close to the front of the chair, nice and tall spine. Instrument looks like it's coming out of their person at a good spot. They chose to go higher and restart the whole thing over, but the coming down part of this range needed some individual practice. I would start where she currently is and then come down again rather than finish going up, just to isolate that one spot that was not comfortable the last time she played that. This is a really good practice technique for arpeggios, making sure that the hand frame is really solid and that the finger spacing from one string to the other makes an in-tune double stop is quintessential professional technical warm-up here. This is a really good exercise. The musician tends to use a varied amount of bow for each pattern. I'm pretty sure each of these patterns have been the same quantity of notes per bow, but they sometimes get to the frog, sometimes they don't quite get to the tip, sometimes they're only playing within this range here. I would advise the student to do a stopped staccato stroke for each down bow and measure every single note that they need to play in that scale to make sure that they're using all of the bow exactly the same way every time. If they want to use a different type of bow or length of bow for this pattern, it should be consistent throughout. Good fingering. A slight intonation issue on the first shift of past fourth position. Intonation kind of all over the place on this one. I can tell that the student is getting tired of doing these exercises and losing focus on them. I would advise a student be done with this exercise at this point. And you can see how the first finger doesn't pop up when they're going up for the third finger, but it does when they're coming back down for the third finger. That's just excess tension. That could be eliminated. A really nice motion of the elbow underneath the instrument when traveling over to the upper strings But then it pulls itself back over more when they're starting to shift up into the higher positions. Really good technique Really great bow hold. You can see the beautifully curved wrist here with the first finger over the stick, pinkies on top with a nice tilt. You can even see the frog right here peeking out because the tilt of the bow is toward the fingerboard.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So he's, you know, his body was a little bit lower, he's able to kind of rock over on top of this foot to make this left hand move. So it looks like they're starting to move in just because the reach was too much from the undercling to this right hand up here. Which kind of sets them off this really nice little foot sequence to be able to go immediately right foot low and left foot up to this high one. A lot of the moves leading into it. But getting into that position they look really nice. Arms are nice and engaged. The feet, he's got both feet on and is really kind of twisting in. So his bottom foot is lower but his knee is kind of twisted in nice. So he's doing a really good job of keeping tension on both the feet and kind of maintaining a good equilibrium between the two positions. So he's able to utilize both the feet in this case. And just overall doing a really good job getting opposite poles or having both feet on and balanced out. And really pushing through those feet and not losing the tension and not, you know, relying too much on the arms even though the poles are a little bit more positive. He's still moving through those feet really nicely. And then as he moves up to this pinch, he's able to extend off this right foot. So he's really able to take a lot of that energy and that movement to his feet and just kind of stay stable through the arms, keep the tension. So he's looking really good and tensioned up, really balanced out, really being able to drive to those feet.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And in this position we can see that the climber is hanging on with her right hand here. And then she's also using a left foot there. Utilizing a right flagging foot going out to the right. So because she is using opposite points of contact with the wall, and that they're stacked on top of each other, this does allow her to rotate and pivot her body around those two points. But what I'm noticing with this climber is that instead of allowing her body to rotate or pivot in a certain way, we can kind of see that her body is kind of hanging out and away from the wall. So in this opening position that is kind of an okay thing to do just because we can see that her right arm is still able to stay in a straight position, as she reaches up with the left hand. But by allowing her body to sit back away from the wall, this does show that she's not really rotating or pivoting around her foot to kind of place more of her body weight on that foot. So this does make it harder, especially when going into a harder handhold. So for her left hand it does seem like it's a pretty difficult hold for her to maintain. So because she's allowing her body weight to hang out and away from the wall, it's actually making this handhold feel a lot more difficult to hang on to. So I would definitely encourage the climber to really focus on placing her body weight more on her legs, so then that way she can help reduce the amount of strain that her hands are feeling.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He's probably climbing at a much higher level. But it's kind of good to practice those things. I know for me, like warming up, it's good to, you know, if this is part of his warmup, it's like, you know, you still want to climb good, how you're going to climb the rest of the day. So that way you kind of get those movements down. And so then here he does it again, so you can see his whole right side is just opening up. He's got both feet on, he's engaged on the arm. But it's kind of this movement that he could, you know, he could be matched on the left hand or have his right hand low and then kind of shift this knee, get his hips close to the wall and kind of shift his weight over and just move a little bit, maybe move it a little bit better. So, kind of off to a good start. I think, you know, he makes it to the top of the wall, but he does do a couple kind of weird things like dropping his arm a lot. I don't know if it's like to look cool or what, but he kind of drops and lets his one arm hang and then kind of just pulls through on one arm. So, I think the route is pretty easy for him. And so, maybe he's like showing off or trying to look cool or I don't know what the point of it is, but it's kind of like he leans back on one arm and he could kind of stay tighter and pull through with both arms. And then here, you know, you can see he does hit the hold, but he is right hand, right foot, you know, his back is all kind of arched, he's kind of pushing himself way out, you know, so ideally to kind of climb smoothly and when he gets to harder holds, he's going to kind of want to situate, you know, rock his weight over on top of his foot so he can kind of toe straight down, you know, really suction his hips to the wall and just be able to move smoothly. So, yeah, he gets to the top of the wall, but he just kind of does it, you know, it a way that doesn't look, you know, maybe it looks, it's fun to watch and he moves like really loosely and fluidly, but he doesn't really look like he's in control. It kind of looks like he's just kind of floppy moving up the wall. So yeah, like right here he, and it's out of frame, he drops his arm back pretty completely, his right arm. He kind of swings it back, relaxes and then kind of pulls straight through on his right left arm. So I think the holds are just good that he's able to do this, but it's wasting a lot of energy and once he kind of gets some more challenging holds, you know, the idea is that as a better climber, you don't want to spend more energy. Ideally, like the strength and stuff, you can use your advanced strength to kind of make it easier, but this seems to just kind of be, I don't know exactly why he's doing it. Maybe he's warming up and just kind of swinging around and kind of getting loose, but whatever he's doing, it's kind of wasting energy. So I would suggest keeping both hands on and kind of pulling from both hands. That would save a lot of energy.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Not the footwork we're looking for, we're not really getting off the ground, using our legs so to speak. Again, she lets that rebound come down, kind of slides over. Again, not the footwork we're looking for in the Mike in. Again, she would benefit from just working on the step-through movement all by itself. Take out the shot, take out the basketball. Again, dips that left shoulder here on the left side. All the weight shifts to the left. We want it more weight evenly distributed and more specifically, you know, maybe step through on that right foot and lift that left knee. Let it square your hips and shoulders. Here, she's really not squared or a target. Again, she rebounds, it really didn't time it or move, just kind of slides over. Again, not the footwork we're looking for. Kind of swings or hooks the ball up or lifts the ball up. Again, not a lot of control coming off. We've got to use that non-shooting hand. Point of emphasis here. We've got to get that non-shooting hand on the ball to help stabilize it before the shot. Here's the, she kind of throws it up there, lifts it, swings it up there. And see, no real footwork here or not getting off the ground. Again, not the ideal footwork here we're looking for in the Mike and Gerald. Here's the shot. It hits the bottom of the backboard. Again, it's just because it comes off this left hand, not a lot of control, sense of direction here. And again, no real footwork is not there. The spacing's not there to probably complete this to get the result you want. Again, much better attempt here. I'd love to see her go off this left foot on the right side, but she does get a better angle here. You can see the extension of the right arm. Ball might hit a little lower on the box there and hit the rim. The snap, that follow-through down, but she is in a better angle here, much improved from the last two shots. Again, left side, again, just kind of walks over, not the footwork you're wanting to see. I love to see her push off the right foot and pull that left leg up. Again, really tough angle here. I mean, it starts with angles. Basketball is a game of angles and being in a spacing and being in a position to make yourself successful. And again, that ball is sitting in that left palm, I'm sure, right here. No real utilization of the non-shooting hand to help support the ball as it's lifted. Here's the, just basically just lifting it and throwing it up if you will. We want to get our shooting hand more behind the ball, get that guide hand here on the side. We need to get our weight more centered. Here it's all shifted here to the right. Again, see how she dips it? She's just kind of pushing the ball up, lifting it. I don't even know what to call it. It's just not ideal shooting form. It's just not being real strong with the ball. We need that right hand on the ball. We need our weight evenly distributed, be a little more fundamental as we square our body to our target here. Here, see how she dips it? Again, I mean, it's just loosely wobbly on that hand. Again, in a game, a defender's going to strip that. It's a turnover kind of looking to happen here. She would benefit more, just she's got to get two hands on the ball to bring it up. She's going to be stronger with it. She's just not real strong here with the basketball. She does look up. She's trying really hard to find her target. Here see that ball dipping down again here's defense they're gonna strip that ball away. Here the shooter is attempting a right-hand layup. I think the first thing I would want to say about this is, you know, she's just standing underneath the basket. So one, she doesn't really have the proper angle to have her whole body, hips, shoulders, square to her target. So she's having to like sweep it up or lift the ball up with one hand. All that weight kind of goes on the right foot. Again, just not the proper spacing and angle and footwork here on the right side. Again, lets it drop, shifts her weight, kind of lifts the ball if you will. Again, not the spacing angle we want. See the palm of the hand is kind of lifting the ball. Just doesn't have a lot of control and accuracy here. Got to get our weight shifted, be more balanced. She would benefit from just working on the footwork all by itself from the mic and then add the ball, then add the shot. Again, not the ideal transition from left to right on the mic. And again, it starts with spacing and the footwork of getting your body in a position to hit the backboard. Here, we're a little bit too straight on. Again, ideally, I'd love to see her step through with this left foot and pull the right leg up. You put that left hand on the ball and shoot it. Bring it up with two hands here. You're just not in a really position to be successful. The ball's going to be wobbly, out of control. It's not stable as it leaves that hand. Again, you know, she would benefit from getting a better foot spacing here and maybe moving her body to the right. But she's really dipping this right shoulder, sticking the ball in the right palm of the hand to shoot this right layup. All the weight shifts to that right side. Again, you know, she needs to probably be over here a little bit more. This is a tough angle right here to finish off the top of the square. Here's the lift. Again, not ideal shooting form. We want to square our shoulders, put this right shooting hand behind the ball, put the non-shooting left hand on the side to help guide it up. Let's not try to lean here to our right, but step through and square our shoulders and hips to our target. Again, just not getting her body in a position here. The angle that we're looking for, she's a little bit too far under the basket. Got that ball in a very vulnerable position here. Assume it's sitting on the left palm of the hand. She doesn't utilize this non-shooting hand to help support it on the side. And again, not really the footwork we want to see for the Mike. Again, she's just basically got her both her feet side by side, maybe leans a little bit on the left. And then, you know, she kind of basically just slides over, not really the angle you're looking for to hit this top of the square. So again, the ball just sitting now in her left palm of her hand, no real use of that offhand, the non-shooting hand to help support the ball. So important because, you know, the ball's leaving this hand. It just wasn't stable to begin with. So you have no control where it's going to go from this point.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Let's spread our feet here again. I love how, you know, maybe she is right-handed. Let's, you know, she's got that right arm at a 90 degree, but I'd love to see this right hand behind the basketball, that left hand possibly on the side. Here again, this left hand kind of makes its way around the basketball. You know, we got to get that. I think she's a right-handed shooter. We just got to get this left elbow in so that and then when you do that it kind of makes the hand come around. Good knee bend, good dropping of the hips. She does that very well. Here's the release, maybe a little bit too much arc here, a little too much of a rainbow here, maybe take a little bit of this off, and again that big step forward we want to jump up and come straight down. Again, ideally, let's be a ready shooter. We're a little straight up here, locked knees. I'd love to see her bend her knees more, get one foot in front of the other. She is doing a good job of reaching her hands out to catch the basketball, which is good to see. But let's go meet this pass. Let's drop our hips and step into this pass and meet it and try to, and again, it takes practice and she would really benefit from just working on some form shooting. Here's the shot. Again, really two hands shooting the basketball. Ideally, we want to shoot with one, you know, she's extended both arms out. Ideally, we want one shooting hand and arm extended, the other more at a 90 degree. She's really having to step forward to get the ball to the rim. You know, and ideally in this shooting drill, I would want my shooter to be in a more ready position to receive this pass. I'm trying to see where the ball is. It's somewhere in there, or maybe here it is. See how she's standing straight up. You know, we wanna bend our knees, get one leg foot in front of the other, drop our hips and really step in and meet this pass. That also, you know, gives you more power in the use of this lower body. Here's the ball right here. But, you know, she needs to go get this pass and step into it and shoot it. That's what this drill would be all about. She's really not what I consider a ready, aggressive shooter. So it looks like she's, you know, shooting with two hands, and you can see it right here, and in the ego view. So I don't know if she's right-handed or left-handed, to be honest with you, but ideally you want to get one, designate a shooting hand behind the ball, and the other non-shooting hand would be your guide hand, which would be on the side of the ball. Here she followed through with both arms, both hands, and you know, she's having to really, you know, shoot with two hands because she's not getting a lot of leg work here. She's kind of standing straight up. I do see a little jumping here, and her jumping, though, is taking her forward instead of straight up. So ideally we want to be more vertical on her takeoff and then on her landing. And we've got to designate one hand as our shooting hand. Again, here's our landing. A lot of weight here on that left knee. It looks like the feet kind of turn inward. We want to keep our hips square, our feet square to the basket. Hold that follow-through up. Again, here's the landing, really locks out those knees. Let's bend those knees, have a softer landing, more balance, get our feet really under our body. And she also brings both arms back. You know, let's hold this follow through. Let's keep it up there, stay with the shot. And here it looks like it's gonna hit left here. And it's cause she's shooting with two hands. It's just kind of putting some funky spin on the ball and it just throwing off the accuracy of the pathway that the ball needs to go to go in. Here's the shot. She, you know, she does drop her hips, um, spread those feet. She does bend her knees, which is really good to see. I'm not sure what this left hand is doing here. It's, it's probably moving on the ball, so you don't want any extra movement with your, when your hands are on the ball. That's why you want to catch it like you want to shoot it. I love her vision takes her over the top of the ball as she's looking at the rim. Again, I'm trying to get this view over here a little bit better so I can see the hands, but she's shooting with both hands. It's just definitely probably causing this ball to spin sideways instead of that nice backspin we like to see. And again, that big step forward is tough to do when you're being guarded in a game situation. You're not going to be able to take that step forward because there's going to be a defender there. Again, takes that big step forward, follow through goes down, let's keep it up a little bit. Here's the arc, maybe a little bit too much arc, but I'd rather have too much arc than it be shot real flat. Let's have more of a balanced landing. Again, I would really recommend her working in, possibly even do what I call partner shooting, when you just shoot across from one another. Even, let's take off the idea that the ball's got to go in the basket. Just have one person stand here, one person stand here, and you just shoot across from one another. Just working on that form and technique. Again, I love, you know, it looks like that right hand is at 90, you know, the arm is 90 degree with the hand, the ball sitting right there on the right hand. I didn't get a good look here, but that guide hand is kind of making its way around to the behind the ball as well. Again, throwing off the accuracy and the rotation spin that you look for in a shot. Again, takes a big step here with the one foot. We love to for you to jump straight up and come straight down. A lot of that weight's over that, looks like the left knee. Again, that's a lot of weight to be on, for one knee to take on the landing. We want it to be more evenly distributed here. And let's figure out here, if we're right-handed, again, let's start in tight, work on that forearm. Again, this looks good here. I just think it's the second hand or the left hand that makes its way around, causing an elbow to pop out. Again, you know, she doesn't have a lot of power here. It's hard to jump when you both your feet are together. You know, you get more leverage, more power, strength when you can spread those feet and have more of a push-off there. That's why she's got to pull that left hand around to help lift the ball up. So what would help is to get more legs involved in the shot. And you know, again, she catches it, pauses, aims. Again, in a game-like situation, you know, she would never get her shot off because she would be easily defended. But as you notice here in this ego view, see how this, and again, I don't really know if she's a right-handed or left-handed shooter. This hand's starting to kind of move on top of the basketball. So then you're gonna have this real funky spin, if you will. You could see this left hand kind of going on the top. Again, I honestly can't tell if she's a right-handed or left-handed. So that would be the first thing we would need to try to figure out here. You know, I would really recommend her moving in here really close and just shooting, working on her form. Form shooting, really in tight. No dribble, no jumping, just some stationary form shooting. And see how her feet are really apart. Not real balanced and stable here. Let's spread them apart. Let's kind of spread the weight of our body across both feet. Here's the shot. Again, kind of just really pushing the ball out with both hands. Again, stepping forward. We'd love to see her be more vertical and balanced here. But really good. She's got the right idea in terms of getting the ball up high. The ball's got to go up to be able to go in. Again, the feet are really close as she begins to go up into her shot. I like this elbow 90 degrees. She's got her eyes up. Here the shooter is shooting a 15-footer from the free throw line to the basket. Here what I would want to talk about is how her feet are really close together. You know, I don't, it looks like she's a right-hand shooter, then her right foot would need to be slightly in front, left foot behind, shoulder width apart. I love how she's bending her knees though, that's really nice, and dropping those hips. She's looking over the ball, which is where you want to look. Again, it looks really good in this, in this image. I can't really see where her hands are here in this, this stoppage, but let's continue. And here she dribbles it. In this drill you really have no time to dribble it. It's a catch-and-shoot type situation. And again see how her head you can see the eyes drop down to look at the ball. When you do that you take your eyes off the rim. Again, follow through with both hands. Let's say she's right-handed, we got to take this left hand out of the shot. See how both arms are extended. She's got good arc on it. I will give her that. And again, see the landing, a little weight forward off balance. You know, we want to land with our weight evenly distributed on both feet. Again, she starts, see she's kind of like having to heave it up there, push it up there, which is not ideal. It's just going to throw off the accuracy of the ball going to the, to the hoop. Here comes the pass. Again, you know, this is really important to note, you know, she catches it with both hands on the side of the ball. You know, ideally, if she is a right-handed shooter, she's going to catch this ball with this shooting hand behind the ball, the guide hand here on the side, and then you're ready to, your hands are where you want it to be in terms of placement on the basketball. And this is maybe why she's shooting with two hands. She's catching it with both hands on the side. Again, straight up. We need to get in a lower body position, spread our feet, be more balanced. Here's the landing. You see how both arms kind of fall back. We'd like to keep that shooting arm extended out till the ball hits something up here. Again, let's drop our knees, bend them, soft landing. It looks like even our feet are maybe turned to the right. We want to square our hips, our knees, everything to the basket. So you can see how she lands. Here's the shot. She doesn't hold a follow-through. Both arms go down. And see how she lands with one leg really in front of the other. Again, ideally you want to land, and she kind of fell forward I should say, you want to go straight up and come straight down. It's tough because you're being guarded in a game and you can't fall into that defender. But she's got really good arc on the ball. It looks like it's gonna be a little off to the right here. Eyes on target. Good to see. Again, let's get these feet apart, good knee bend, dropping of the hips. Love how she's looking up over the basketball here. Looks like that right arm is at 90 degree, which is good to get that, so that ball kind of sits back on that shooting hand, if that's her shooting hand. you", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Well played. really nice bow use here. You can see how beautifully straight this bow is, which creates a parallel perpendicular line that has a 90-degree angle on each side of the string and bow, making a perfect box. Beautifully in tune. Good bowing, nice phrasing. You can see a really good use of the bow hand here, where every single beginning of the stroke has a tiny bit of energy increase in the finger here. That energy is necessary to create a bite in the string with the bow in the middle. And you can see that it's just the finger engagement with a little bit of wrist motion coming this direction. And that is indicative of a good player who makes a good sound. really clean shift here you can see that movement up the instrument was really smooth really clean and really efficient A little slow here could be faster compared to the tempo just played in the previous melody. Excellent shift, very in tune. Really good hand use here on the left side of the musician. You can see how the vibrato and the first finger are in sync and the open palm here shows that they know how to vibrate clean and clearly and then they move their palm further this direction to help get the fingers back on the fingerboard. Really nice slur from the D to the A string. Good posture to start. This foot is a little far back. I would have this foot also straight. It's possible they're doing this to make the E string of the violin more easily accessible with the bow and not have to bang their leg when they're using that string. Instrument placement looks really good straight off of the shoulder and head and neck and shoulders are aligned like a normal sitting position. Left hand also looks really good. Elbow is underneath the instrument. Nice curved fingers. Thumb looks to be in a good place. At the tail end here, wrist comes in, thumb pops up. Wrist needs to stay out and the thumb needs to stay down. Excellent consistency with this etude. The importance is the regularity of each type of note. All of the bumps need to have the same kind of length and the ba-da-da need to have a similar sound when they're each at the end of the bow. Really nice transition between the first melody section and this deeper melody. Tempo did slow down just slightly. Keep the tempo up here. The best part about the shift there is they're shifting on the old string and then placing their finger on the new string and then moving the bow. It's very clean and very nice to listen to. Ball hold looks really, really nice. You can see curved pinky right on top and an excellent use of the first hanger curled over the stick here.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Once the water comes to a boil she cuts the heat off and with this rag grabs the side of the saucepan She lights her burner to high heat and adds her saucepan of water. Typically a teabag needs to steep anywhere between three and five minutes, so obviously pouring the milk in stops the steeping process and it's a little premature for her to do at this step. After the tea has steeped for about 30 to 45 seconds, she adds in a little bit of this milk. It could be almond milk, it could be regular milk, to the serving mug. The first step in making a milk tea is to gather all of the equipment and the ingredients that you will need. Here you can see that she has grabbed her serving mug and previously a saucepan that she is going to boil her tea in. She adds it to her serving mug and the tea bag that's already inside. Next she selects her tea bag which appears to be a green tea. That's a great type of tea to use in a milk tea. You could also use any tea that you had on hand. Darjeeling, English, Earl Grey, Chai, black tea. It really is a personal preference and she sets the mug and the teabag next to the boiling water on the countertop. In the mug, she measures out enough water to then add into her saucepan. She could have done that in a liquid measuring cup as well, but the mug works just fine.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

Just a lot of unpredictability with these ones. If the connection is made slightly lower just because of the shape of the foot plus the lean back in the stance, this ball can literally go anywhere. So it's just not something I would recommend technique wise. Again I'd prefer to see that toe pointing up. And trying to get around the top of the ball almost to ensure that we're keeping it down. Also less of a lean back in the stance because that's going to add fuel to the fire if we do connect with the ball lower down. That lean back is going to add extra height and a higher angle in the trajectory overall. Just stance overall in this passing, lean back too often, too consistently. And just the shape of the foot upon connection. A little bit on the risky side. So one thing the player is doing well at is consistently making a connection with an appropriate part of the ball and the appropriate part of the ball here to keep the shot down is probably closer to that central line. Central kind of, if we draw a line through a circle, just hitting that central line and not hitting the bottom half of the ball, the further down the connection is made it's going to go higher, it's going to bobble. So even though the player is leaning back a lot, we're seeing very flat passes and again this is due to the player making consistent connections with the centre line and not slipping the foot under the ball causing it to bobble up and go high. Again, more of a passing stance, flat foot in, we're up, very leaned back, very leaned back here in the upper body, and then also with the head down, potentially you want to see this point brought in a little bit so we can see a more straight up head, and then less of a leaned back body, and also the hips brought slightly forward here. As we can see what the player is doing here is generating that forward spin on the pass, trying to hit the ball in an upwards motion, but also keeping it flat, so just giving it that extra bit of forward spin to get it into the target's hands with that extra bit of speed. So seeing pretty consistent Opening out of both feet when connecting with the ball Depending on the foot. So here the left foot being opened out very early and ankle is locked in this kind of position the toe is not being dragged across the body and The foot is not being dragged across the body. So kind of accurate push passes into the hands here And Yeah, just good control overall with with like the passing even though it's a moving ball however If we are trying to keep it down if we're going with longer passes, I feel like a small bit of a better technique would be to try and actually Get this foot more upwards and to try connect with the ball with more of a straight leg and That way again if we bring this Foot kind of upwards with a toe being pointed up it's going to help us actually get around the top of the ball and Push it into the ground more creating that spin and just create more of a flat rolling pass in Versus one that has bobbles and could ultimately take a little hop up into the sky if we connect with the wrong part of the ball because our foot is pointing down the way And here we see a little bit of a inaccurate connection compared to the last ones. We can see foot connecting below that centre point on the ball. So this one is going to get a lift. And we see it just kind of coming up and still kind of a comfortable catch but just a little bit of inconsistency. We can see the difference between those ones being kept down and those ones accidentally rising up a little bit. And with this lean back it gives this probably more of a lift than it should have got based on the power that was in the kick. But again just pushing off with a leg lean back. So far once it extends again it's going to give it that extra lift here. So in this video, even though it is called penalty kicks, it looks to be more of a kind of passing, stance passing type exercise where the ball is just being played to this player in the goal and kind of back and it's up and it's back and the players from time to time knocking it to the sides, different parts of the goal on entry but pretty much low. So there's no approach from the player, generally from most of these, as the ball is rolled to the player. The ball already has momentum, the player is pretty static upon connection with the ball so not bringing much momentum themselves to the ball but the ball is bringing the momentum to their kick and their connection. But we will look at, nonetheless, we will look at the technique that is used in the kicks, the connection on the kicks, the power on the kicks, the spin used if there is any and then just the overall stance and body shape. Usually we would look at the point of entry but it's not really looking like this player is trying to score shots more than kind of play passes back and forward with this player that's in the goal. Straight away also just noticing on the technique, bit of a dangerous step into the ball here. As we can see the player is bringing momentum this direction, foot pointing in this direction, weight could end up going over on that ankle if they are going to bring momentum with the upper body through. This could be considered a dangerous kind of a do not do in terms of stance when kicking a ball because again it's just not very healthy on that ankle, putting weight on it whilst it's twisted inwards. So just an interesting one here as we see this ball kind of move and take its first bounce and kind of rolls from here to when it bounces we'll see that there is Neutral spin on the ball. So no spin on the ball as the ball has come in towards the right foot Just before the connection we see it takes just a little hop up and a little bounce Which could cause the connection to be made with a lower part of the ball Which will cause the ball to in turn bobble up again but what the players doing a good job at consistently here is Making connections as mentioned in the last recording with the center of the ball and kind of pushing through the center of the ball Not making connections with the bottom of the ball despite the foot Kind of being almost angled downwards from the ankle to the toe The player again is doing well to keep the ball down despite the lean back and it's just good connection control and accurate connections on the ball when redirecting it Again, just on this connection, massive lean back here. See the leg, very exposed, nearly parallel with the ground. Shortly after the kick, the connection is made. And a big lean back and also a big twist on the shoulder. So overall, very off balance. The shot does not get affected here because the player has elected to just kind of go inside of the foot and keeping it low into this bottom corner. But if the player brings power and uses this kind of a stance, there is a big risk that this ball can go extremely high because of the angle that the player is leaning back at. There's also a little bit of a disconnect between both cameras, both points of view. We can see here a little bit of distance on the ball. Here the ball is still touching the foot. But with that being said, we see the player kind of leaning back. We've got the flat foot almost pointing downwards if pointing in any direction. So kind of a strange one for shooting or passing. The only time we'd want to see a foot angled down that way would be if they're following through in a straight forward motion to try to expose the laces to the ball and connect with the laces. But generally with a pass, you would rather see actually the opposite where the toe is pointing up if anything. And we're wrapping our foot around the ball to get that kind of upward spin and help it speed into our target a little bit faster.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I think that this is more of a straight-on pinch, so instead of wrapping the right side here, it's probably better to go straight on and open up that wrist a little bit, similar to how you're seeing the climber pinch this left hand. So here we have a right hand on a pretty decent down pulling hold, and this left hand undercling here. Kramer's driving in with their left foot here down low and bringing in the right and hand foot matching here. Kramer then tries to match feet, but they both slip. I bet the left foot actually kicked the right foot off of the hold. And they both slipped. Kramer's moving maybe a little bit faster than they need to. With these delicate foot moves, it's best to take enough time. Slow is fast, sort of thing.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And in that move we can see that they were hanging on with a right hand on the starting handhold. And they did have a right foot behind the body. And then we can see that with this movement that their left leg is now kind of kicking out into the side over there. So by using the left hand and right foot she does allow herself to really rotate her body in an appropriate way so that her right side of her body gets closer to the wall. So this is a good thing to see. The one thing that's making this move a little bit more difficult for this clamor is what's going on with that left flagging foot. So because the clamor is kind of kicking that leg out away from the wall this kind of shows to me that the clamor is not entirely comfortable of what's going on with her right foot and might be generating some power with her left leg in order to complete this move here. But by kicking her leg in this direction it's actually helping to pull her body away from the wall. So it could be harder to complete this move overall. So I would definitely recommend to the clamor that they focus on controlling what's going on with the flagging foot and making sure it's in the same position from the beginning of the move to the end of the move and to reduce the amount of kicking that they're doing. And so here we can see the clammer is having a little bit of difficulty of what to do next But she has been able to switch her feet so now her left foot is on the foothold And we can see that her right foot is kind of in this bent position So it should be the flagging foot that should be a little bit more out and direct kind of pressed up against the wall So because her right flagging foot is in this bent position It's actually not really helping her out too much to be able to trust her lower body positioning But by allowing that right foot to kind of be extended out more to the right She can then allow the left side of body to kind of rotate and pivot around that foot And then another thing that we can see the clammer is doing is she is having a hard time hanging on to that right hand Hold so we do see that she's kind of pulling or engaging with that right arm to try and make that feel better But being that this hold is kind of flat on the top By pulling into it is actually making it harder to hang on to this handhold So I would definitely encourage the clammer to train make sure that they keep their arm in a straight position So then that way they can get the best use out of this handhold", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}
