At this moment the climber needs to sustain the grips pulling it towards him. So in this case he also needs to apply not only the pulling motion but also keep the palms to be facing towards the hole to create pressure while pushing down on the foot. This will create a system in where the climber once he gets to create pressure at the feet he will be able to gain height in a parallel direction but needs to make sure that he keeps his center of gravity as close as he can to the areas of support being in the hands and on the foot. So eventually he will have to bring his chest in to make the next move. Here we can see the climber had pressed in his right foot to gain height and quickly moved the right hand to be positioned with the palm facing towards the lip above. This one is called undercling. So in order for the climber sustaining this move, the climber must create pressure by pushing away and towards the lip. So and then at the same time in order to create friction the climber must pull the hold towards him. He needs to make sure that the elbow is pushing towards the core or on the sides of the core and this needs to be happening continuously as he then brings his left foot into placement. As we can see the left foot has come into place and the climber is also still continuing to sustain on the grip below with the left hand. The climber again instead of pushing down is pulling it towards the climber so that the climber is able to create a calming motion to sustain the grip. Here the climber was able to reapply the foot that was in the heel hook to be placed above the hold. And the climber releases the left foot and keeps it extended to be flagging out. This to give the climber balance and control over stabilizing the next move. So the climber needs to keep his hips square, the reason why the climber drops the foot, and shifts the weight to be placed on the highest foot being in place. This one, the climber will need to pull with force on the sloper and push down hard on the right foot. This one almost creating a dynamic, slight jump for the climber to meet the lip of the hold that is his next move. As we can see, the climber performed pulling on the two areas of support, being the heel hook and the hand being in place. And that helped the climber gain height for making the reach with the right hand being placed on the purple block. He does this by sending the outer area of the hand towards the wall and cups it, catching the edge of that block. This one, the knuckles are placed above that edge of the hold at the block and this will help the climber to create friction on the hold once he places the weight on the hold. So the climber needs to keep the fingers together and try to meet the skin with the pores of the hold to create friction. That way the climber will be able to stick the hand grip. the climber was able to transfer over the left hand to join the right hand on a match at the same hold. This one being a jug, the climber is able to wrap the hands around it. And this makes it a solid grip. So, the climber before transferring the left hand over to the match, he had made sure that he transferred his center of gravity to come out and be under the right hand, the right hand being the one to support, after pushing and placing the left foot. Due to the jump, the climber had lost pressure at the feet and now the climber is swinging out. This is called cutting feet because none of the feet are at the moment on the wall. And as the climber had reached the right hand onto the lip, this one is a secured grip as the climber is able to wrap around the fingers behind the hold and is able to pull it to continue to create pressure. As the climber was gaining height, then the left hand no longer had the same pressure on the sloper so the climber was able to just hang on one hand to bring the left hand and secure the grip. It's important that the climber glances always down at the feet when making a foot switch. In this case, the climber is bringing the left foot to come into place by applying the toe above the lip of the hold to release the heel hook. The left toe must apply sufficient pressure and the climber needs to do this carefully because releasing heel hooks can be tricky as it could compromise the climber's grips if driving a lot of force between power if not being able to release it with control. Unfortunately, the climber was not able to go further on the reach to be able to grab onto the hold due to the right foot slipping out of the hold. In the case that the climber was going to try this again, he needs to make sure he pushes on the hold forcefully if he knows that the foot may come out of place. Since the type of hold that the climber was going for, being the last hold, seemed to be positive, looking like a horn, so the climber could have wrapped the hand and hook onto it before he loses pressure down at the feet. Here we can see the climber making the reach to the last hold. This one, he keeps the arm extended and he's going slightly in front of him to the right. This, he keeps the left leg extended. This is called flagging out, which helps him to have balance as he will need to shift his weight over to the foot being in position. And originally he had come from replacing the hand from being undercling to quickly bring it up to the last hold. So the climber was also standing over his right leg and extending it to gain height. Now that the climber was able to secure the sloper grip with the left hand, the climber was able to adjust the right hand grip. This one, previously the climber had hooked it from being under it and this time the climber is repositioned the hand so he's cupping it to the side. This he will need to create pressure by pulling in. In order to engage more power onto that grip, the climber leans slightly over to the left side and to maintain the pressure of the sloper that he needs to lean down, the climber sends the leg out so that the climber is able to transfer the weight to the grips in the right way, keeping center of gravity and positioned due to the heel hook. It can be difficult if the climber tries to sustain on the grip that isn't an undercling above him and needed to continue to pull it towards him as he brought the chest over the hold, this to transfer over the center of gravity to be close to the area of support. And then quickly once the climber was able to gain height while pulling himself in, he sends the left hand up to the next hold, this one being the last hold. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start, meaning that each hand has its own hold and they are held differently. The top one, being a big jug, the climber is able to wrap the hand around the lip. And to create pressure, the climber must create force by pulling on the hold. On the left hand, we can see how the climber is holding onto a jug that's upside down. This is called an undercling. So the climber will place the hand at the lip and slide the fingers behind it. Again, to wrap the hand around and pull it towards him in order to sustain the grip. Once the climber gets to place the feet on the wall and is no longer on the ground, then the climb will start. In this case, the climber will have to apply a pull motion of both grips towards him as he drops the weight to create pressure. Now that the climber was able to make a secured left foot placement, the climber continued to pull himself towards the hold on the undercling of the right hand, creating more pressure by pinching on the hold with the thumb being placed on the outside and sends quickly the left hand to be placed the same way that the right hand is to be placed on an undercling. Here the climber was able to bring his right foot at a high stance placing the toe above the block. Once the climber gets to place the toe he might potentially push himself away swinging again away from the wall so it's important that the climber presses down on the toe as a pedal to hook himself with friction to bring himself close to the wall and he keeps the leg extended on dropping the leg will help the climber to also engage the core and remain himself and stop himself from swinging by keeping the center of gravity below the hold. Once the climber has gained stability over the swing then the climber will be able to engage on a pull up to the next hold and pressing down on the foot. It was smart of the climber to send the flag before making the pull onto the wall. This is important because if the climber had released the flag as he was going up, then it will retract him on the reach. In this case, the climber was able to pull himself in, engaging the heel hook and forcing the grip to come close to his chest to send the left hand out on the sloper. The left hand being reached out, he was able to apply pressure immediately and stick the move. He does this by keeping an open hand and sticks the fingers against the sloper and at the top, the climber is able to catch with the force of the sloper as he is trying to cup the hand to create force at the fingertips. And because the climber initially, when palming the sloper, he wasn't getting the grip, he smears slightly the hand to try to continue to gain height to reach the sloper meeting the edge of the wall. So in this case, it's important that the climber continues to palm it until he can secure a grip and feels that the entire hand is meeting with the surface of the sloper. In order to the climber continue to not lose pressure at the left hand, he will need to continue to keep the elbow close to the wall when transferring over the weight at the left hand. It's important that the climber looks down at the feet when making a foot switch. In this case, the climber is bringing the right toe to come into place at the hold and before releasing the left foot. It's important that he also applies accurate pressure and make sure he applies it to the right area of the hold as he will need to then use it for when he releases the right hand out of the hold. The climber was able to walk the hands to the edge of the jug when being on the match before and sends the left hand to go out for the pinch when engaging on a forceful pull up while maintaining a stance on the left foot down below. The climber gets to secure the left hand grip by squeezing on the hold. This is called a pinch hold because the climber is engaging the thumb on the other side and this gives a gripping power. Now the climber in order to apply sufficient pressure to it and knowing how to squeeze the hold, the climber transfers weight to it by leaning on the hold. And then quickly the climber sends the right foot to come into place matching the hold with the right hand. The heel going into the wall and placed behind the hold, this is called a heel hook which the climber will use to engage into a powerful move after this one. And so the heel hook will work by the climber placing it behind the lip of the hold and once the climber gets to secure it then he will use it to pull himself in towards the wall which his center of gravity remains in the core. So when the climber gets to engage the leg he will do a pull effect pushing the heel towards the lip of the hold and then also once the climber gains height then the climber can use it to push the heel down to gain height as the climber races for the next hold. The climber is making a placement of the left foot to match where the left grip is. This is when the climber is positioning the toe above the hold. And once the climber applies pressure on the toe, then the climber will be able to release the right foot to come into a better stance to release the left hand out of its place.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It does look like the feet are limited but she's able to catch it and then immediately kind of recompose herself get back to a good position and kind of set out for what the next move is. So here we can see the first couple moves she does the same as before, utilizes that heel hook. So now she's in that heel hook position. You can see before she removes that left hand, she is setting up the back leg. So now she's super nice and balanced. And it really shows she's able to just kind of reach this handhold and really utilize every bit of balance and power she has and doesn't rip off the wall and makes it look really smooth. So yeah, we can see just how much her body does not shift at all. She's pretty much in the same exact position as before, but now with her left hand up higher, which just shows you like kind of getting into that position and driving for that position is so much better than just kind of speeding your way through where you have to fight the barn door and fight to keep yourself back into the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Some boulders like this you don't get a lot of attempts just because they're long and they're hard. And I think that this boulder fits into that category. So hopefully the climber gets another attempt and hopefully they get here again. But it's often that you get one or two shots on a boulder like this. So the climber is then able to just pounce up into this clamshell jug and it looks like the boulder has definitely a reprieve here. Alright, so here we have the climber on this left hand brick pinch and they're currently hand heeling the right start hold of the boulder. Left foot is down on the left hand start hold or what was the left hand start hold. And they're in the crux position or entering into the crux move of the boulder. So the climber was able to flip this purple hold here into a double underclings and walk their left foot up onto that knob hold that they went out left hand to And pretty desperately gets into this blue hold here off of the double underclings Climbers definitely pretty gassed at this point So here we have the climber getting out to the left hand here, which is a big deal for everybody. Yeah, they were able to keep their hand on the right side of the pinch here and basically just get locked between the right hand and the right heel. And you'll notice how aggressively this left back flag is. Their left foot is back flagging super hard out to the right. And luckily their heel doesn't pick, but that's allowing the climber to get out to the left. And you just notice how extended this arm is kind of just barely tagging it, but they're there. And now that the climber is sort of pushing this way on this hold, the climber is now in compression. So it really eases up a lot once you do this move. So good on that climber.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The type of hold of the climber sustaining is a block hold and he brings it to palm the side of the hold bringing the fingers at the top edge and the palm onto the right side of the block. This the climber then will have to create pressure by leaning on the hold to create friction between the skin and the pores of the hold to sustain the grip. This making the application at the corner of the hold will help the climber be able to close the grip which will create more force when holding at the hold. Now in order to get there the climber had to push down on the pinch as as pushing down on the heel being in place while standing forcefully on the left foot initially. It's important that the climber, when making the transitions and moves, he does a good application of footwork, meaning that he will need to concentrate on bringing his center of gravity over at the areas of support down at the feet and maintaining pressure when making the transitions of the hands over the grips. In this case, the right heel was placed too much at the edge of the hold rather than trying to place it further in to secure the heel placement when making the rotation, especially when going at a high reach. Heel hooks are known to be very strong because it can stay in place when going for a series of moves at distance from the hold and also going for a powerful move. So the climber would have succeeded if he just brought the heel inwards slightly into the hold. Here the climber, once making the foot switch, he's transferring the weight over to the foot being in place. Now this moment as he is figuring out how to spread his weight onto the grips, he is struggling. The reason why he commits into small pull-ups and adjusts the right hand to bring it closer to the left side of that hole that he's gripping. The climber is bringing both hands onto the same hold. As we can see the type of hold is a jug, meaning that the climber is able to wrap the hands behind the lip and places the thumbs if possible to force the grip. In this instance the climber has brought the left hand to match on the same hold. Matching is when both of the hands are placed on the same hold. The climber is bringing the left toe into placement, this one to match the left hand. In order for the climber to sustain pressure to it, he brings the foot above the hold and will have to place the toe against the hold and press down. This one while the climber continuously applies the pull motion towards the climber to block the move. Later on, the climber will have to adjust the stance on the right foot in order to release the left hand to the next move. It seems as the climber was struggling to keep the grips in place and transferring the weight onto the right foot previously down below and has placed the left foot on the foot chip instead to send the right foot up to be at a higher placement. This time he sends the heel in at a high stance coming to match where the left hand is bringing the heel into the wall and behind the edge of the hold. Heel hooks are known to be technical footwork and can apply a lot of power when being in use. In this case the climber will be able to place the heel in and then slightly hook it behind the hold at the edge behind the edge and then will have to bring the toe inwards onto the wall when using it. When the climber gets to use a heel hook he will then be able to pull his center of gravity close to the wall by bending the leg. This will help him also while standing on the left foot to gain height and it's important that the climber knows how to use a heel hook when he's gaining height because right now he's using it to pull himself up to later on stand over the hold. It's important that the climber gets to not engage the arms as much but instead the grips. The reason why the climber was able to extend the arm while sustaining the grip once he had secured it. And needs to continually apply force onto the grips to release some of the pressure at the feet in order to do the foot switch. In this case the climber is bringing both of the toes into a match to the foot chip down below. Bringing the right foot into place first. Apply some of the pressure onto the hold to release the left foot. It's important that the climber continues to apply pressure at the feet so that he doesn't get to swing out of the wall. And needs to do this in control while glancing down at the feet. The climber is able to bring the left hand up to the next hold. This one being at reach, the climber had to commit into a pull-up motion that was close to the wall while pushing down on the right foot that had come into place. And the type of hold the climber is sustaining is a slightly sloped pinch. This one with two positive sides, the climber is able to place the fingers onto one side and the thumb on the other. The climber then will have to squeeze the hold so that he's able to create like a clamping motion in order to maintain the grip on the hold. And will need to lean back to create pressure as well as pointing the elbow out to create force onto holding the hold. Here the climber is starting at a two hand hold start. The top hold is a big jug meaning that the climber is able to place the hand behind the lip of the hold and in order to sustain the hold the climber must create pressure towards him and the left hand is placed on a jug that's upside down. This is called an undercling so the climber must bring the hand underneath facing the hold and the climber is able to place the fingers inside of the hold in order for the climber to sustain pressure on the grip. The climber then must pull it towards him as well. The climber must compress between pulling on both of the holds as he drops the weight. The climb will start until the climber's feet are on the wall. When the climber made the hand placement we can see how the heel hook has come out of place. This was the main area of support. So heel hooks can create a lot of force but also they need to be released intentionally. So this one as the climber applied pressure onto the grip the climbers right foot has come out of place. This might have been that the climbers foot placement was too much placed at the edge of the hold and when the climber created pressure at the grip then the climber lost pressure at the heel and the heel has slipped off from the hold. Here the climbers right foot has come out of place. This due to the lack of pressure potentially because the climber was able to apply pressure once placing the left hand but it's able to continue to sustain the move due to the comfortable grip. The climber then must bring the foot back into place in order to move up to the next hold. Once the climber gets to place the toe onto the foothold, which is the right foot, the climber then will be able to press on both of the feet while still sustaining the grip above to release the left hand that's in on an underclaim. At this moment as the climber is getting positioned, the climb has started. This is because the climber's feet are on the wall. Down below we can see how the climber is attempting to do a foot switch and onto a small foot chip. Because the hold is small, the climber must apply pressure on the right foot that's coming into place to free up the left toe. In order to do this, the climber continuously needs to pull on the grips while he transfers over the weight to the foot taking place.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She'll just bring her left foot up and load it right away. And now this time on it, she doesn't seem to really pull with the heel. It seems like she just sets it and matches this left hand and tries to pull up. So you can see just how far down her hips are. Whereas in the last attempt, she really pulled up through that heel and really got into a better position. You can see that she kind of moves off to the side. She kind of shifts her weight back to the left so she can grab this pinch. So just kind of utilizing her body position so she doesn't have to pull as hard. She's kind of able to keep her body in a good position to kind of let her sink into her feet.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

You can just see this right foot sneaking in here, occupying this flatter part of the usable surface. This is a pretty small space between the left hand and the right foot, so the climber is going to need to really get these hips up and over and lock down this left arm in order to get any purchase on the target hold here. Here we have a good look at this hand foot match, left hand undercling, and kind of getting this tight toe in here on the start hold. Notice that the climber is fully extended in the right hand. This allows for just more operating space in this small box down here. Yeah, interesting start. Climber was able to come in and match on the top of this green hold. And really the climber needs to wrench over this right toe, get these hips a little higher. That's going to allow them to lock off this pinch, but this pinch is pretty bad and it looks like this target holds pretty bad too. I do believe that a straight on grip like this and right on the front of it is probably the best way, but this climber seems to want to wrap around the right side of the hold. Climber's then able to match up this right hand, which was the right start hold, and keeping this left foot where it is, getting this left hand brick pinch out here.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This so that the climber is able to gain height when making the reach. It's important that the center of gravity is being raised also when the climber makes the pull of the heel hook towards the climber and being placed behind the edge of the hold. As the climber is gaining height, the climber sends the right hand to come into place onto the purple block. As we can see, the climber brings the fingers to meet the top area of the hold and bends at the knuckles to cup the hold and maintain a closed grip. It's important that the climber applies weight by leaning on the hold because he needs to generate friction between the fingers or the skin towards the pores of the hold. This one, because the hold is slightly slanted downwards, so it's important that once the climber finds a catch of the skin meeting the hold, then the climber needs to apply pressure in order to move on. Here we can see how the climber has brought the left hand over to match the right hand. As both of the hands are on the jug, the climber is able to sustain the grip and before the climber sent the left hand over, the climber was pressing hard on the left toe and had dropped the right leg to transfer over the weight on the push for the left toe being in place. As the climber was extending, the climber then had released the left hand to bring it up to place. Here, as the climber was making the reach to the sloper, the climber lacked distance. This is because when the climber was forcing the pull, he needed to pull harder to gain more distance and able to apply the hand as far in to the hold. This way the climber was able to create friction once getting in to the hold by keeping an open hand. Once the skin meets the hold, then the climber will have to create more pressure at the fingertips and then keep the elbow as close as he can to the wall to create a pull motion. In this case, the climber only got to the very tip of the sloper rather than further in. Before the climber was able to go up to further reach, the climber had let the left foot come out of place and go straight onto a flag. This is called a back flag when the leg is extended and especially if it's folded behind the right foot that's being in the heel placement. So the back flags can be important because the climber will be able to have a full extension once applying pressure onto the hold. But in this case, the climber had released it earlier, retracting him from the move. This didn't allow him to get the distance that he needed. The climbers starting at a two hand hold start, meaning that each hand is placed on a different hold. As we can see the right hand is placed on a jug, meaning the climber is able to place the hand as a hook or be able to place it behind the edge of the hold. And can comfortably lean on the hold by pulling on it. And the left hand is placed on an upside down jug. This is called an undercling. So the climber will slide the fingers behind the lip of the hold and pull it towards him in order to create pressure. Now once the climber gets to apply the feet onto the wall and he's no longer on the ground, then the climb will start. Also in order to apply the pressure on both of the grips, the climber will have to drop his weight onto the holds to create a compression pull motion in order to sustain the move. Because the next hold is a distance, it was important that once the climber secured the grip of the right hand on the block, then he moves quickly to the next hold. The left hand being placed open-handed due to the next hold being a sloper, meaning that there is no edge, so the climber will need to open the palm to be placed as far in as he can in order to apply friction to the hold. Once the climber gets to apply the hand above the sloper, then the climber will need to maintain keeping the elbow close to the wall and lean on the hold in order to create pressure. For this, the climber can create friction between the skin at the fingertips, as he would have to slightly push down on the fingertips to hold it, and also apply weight to get the catch. In order for the climber to go there, we can see how his left foot has come out of place and is swung over to the right side, pointed out. This is called a back flag, which he does perform pretty hard in order to extend the move out left when going for the reach. This will help the climber keep the center of gravity as close as he can to the area of support, which is the heel hook being in place and the block that he's sustaining. The climber originally had made the move out left to place the left hand on the pinch hold. This one because the climber is sustaining it on a clamping motion where he squeezes the hold. And to create pressure, the climber sends the elbow out. And as we can see, the climber is engaging on a pull-up position to release the right foot to bring it into a higher placement. This one bringing the heel in towards the wall and behind the lip of the hold. It's important that the climber makes sure that he secures the placement of the heel by bringing it in behind the edge of the hold. In this case, heel hooks are known to be technical and powerful placements as the climber will be able to pull on the leg and also create force by pushing it down, almost used as a third hand. So the climber is the reason why he had slightly bumped the right hand over to the edge of the hold to make space for the heel placement. The climber has made the first placement of the right foot down below, this one being on a foot chip, and sends the left foot to bring it into place to match the left hand. Matching is when both of the limbs are in the same hold, and he brings the toe to be placed above the undercling hold, and he will bring the toe to come into place above it by creating pressure, pushing down once it's placed.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So that's kind of an important part of it, it's just not setting the heel and using it to relieve tension or relieve the arm, but actually kind of driving down through it. That way you can kind of lift yourself up the wall. So again, off to a good start, kind of finding these positions, really sinking into them, keeping that arm straight, getting the feet high so that she can kind of pull and drive through and use the power of her feet and her arms to kind of propel herself up the wall. Then she kind of loses some tension, her left leg kind of swings up into the right. So you can see it's kind of tempting to do a back play because she's got right hand on, right foot on. So I think this is where she needed to kind of tension on get position. So as she reaches the left hand up and takes off this pinch, her body barn doors and all that weights kind of pulls her off. So she gets so close to this hold. By the time she loses balance and is almost there, she's kind of yanked from it and just almost just pulled off the wall by her body weight being unbalanced. So in this case, before she makes this left hand, while her left hand is still down here, she wants to just send that back leg out here. That'll balance her out, let her probably get higher up onto this heel hook, really shift that knee over. So she's kind of healing straight down through it. And then she should just be able to slowly and casually go up to this handhold. Then again, sending this heel hook up here to the right, so that way she can kind of pull down through her leg and take that right hand and move it up. Instead of having to toe down with her toe, this heel is really going to let her kind of lock in and pull straight down through her leg.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I think that the climbers just a bit fatigued and they just come up a little bit short on this hold And here we have what is essentially the start of this boulder. Left hand on this green pinch and right hand on the right start hold here. So this was just a really good heel placement. They place the heel very delicately but very intentionally. So this hold kind of does this point here and the climber made very sure that they got the ball of their heel right on top of that point. With little things like this they can make the difference in climbing.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It's important that the climber continues to gain height when at the jump in order to boost the jump on the right foot. If it's engaged early, then the climber's center of gravity will be pushed away from the wall. Once the climber has secured the grips and the foot positioning, we can see him dropping the weight. This he brings his center of gravity low to keep his feet at a high stance and with the arms extended he is right now performing into a slight swing that brings him back while aiming to the hole that reach by making eye contact. This is because the climber is about to perform a dynamic move where the climber will need to launch himself from his feet and hand placements in order to commit to the hole that reach as a jump. If the climber was to attempt this again, he needs to focus on making a more forceful jump so that he can gain more distance to apply the palm over the edge of the hold to have more gripping power as the climber only placing the fingertips before made it really hard for the climber to sustain the hold before dropping the weight. Here we can see the climber peeling off from the hand placement. This is because the climber had a very great swing and in sustaining the hold he didn't have enough contact of his grip over the edge of the hold and has released the grip to land onto the mat ending the climb. The climber making some hand gestures, this is because he's mimicking the moves that he will be performing when at the wall. It helps him visualize what holes he will encounter and what body positioning he must do before commuting to the climb. The climber just made an immediate placement of the right hand yet to place the entire hand over the edge of the hold and only is able to sustain it by the fingertips. This is a very committing move so ideally the climber can try to surface most of the palm towards the edge of the hold in order to sustain it to create more friction. Friction is done between contact of the skin with the pores of the hold and he must close the grip and create friction securing the hand placement before he gets to drop the weight. The dropping of the weight will come into place once the climber's center of gravity gets to line up right underneath the right hand placement and as we can see the climber had engaged on the right foot slightly earlier as we can see him already being pushed away from the wall. So in this case the climber must continue to apply pressure into that grip in order to sustain the swing and if the climber can bring the left hand up to bring it over to support that would be ideal. Here we can see the climber has pressed onto that left foot first as it's no longer in contact with the foothold. And pushing onto that left foot helps the climber to gain direction to stay underneath the hold at reach. Now, it's important that the climber, when pulling himself in, he brings the chest towards the wall so that he's able to bring his center of gravity close when going up for the reach. The climber starts when the climber is no longer standing on the mat and right now he has placed the feet onto the wall. The right foot of the climber places it on a larger foot where he places the bottom front box of the shoe to be surfaced with the top of the hold. Now the climber is leaning back over two handhold starts and both of them are shaped rounded with a hole in the inside where the climber gets to place all of the fingers towards the inside of the hole. This one has an edge on the inside that the climber is able to place the fingertips and push the fingertips into it in order to sustain the grip as it's rounded. The outside, the climber presses the thumb bringing it over to a pinch to add extra gripping power.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I think he could be up a little higher into the wall a little bit closer. Because you can kind of see his, his kind of hips are already dropping out from the wall. And his arm is quite bent, so ideally maybe getting high enough to have his arm more straight. But he's already kind of reaching in such a low position, so when he does hit the hold, he has to like straight arm his weight so far down to the left.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

When both of the hands are in the same hold, this is called matching. And now the climber, once securing the grip, he's able to lean back to transfer the weight at the grips, as he continues to push over on the right foot to bring over his center of gravity underneath his grips. In the climber performing a pull-up in order to release the left hand, we can see the left foot has come out of place. This was the only foot being in place so now it's compromising the climber's move. The climber needed to secure the grips in order to bring his left foot up to placement, which right now he's pressing the toe area of the box towards the right side inside of the hold. This so that he will be able to push away to transfer over the weight to the highest foot. Now also the climber needed to adjust the grips because needed to allow space for both of the hands to be on the same edge of the hold as eventually he will have to release the left hand to go up for the next placement. The climber making the next move, he sends the left hand to be placed at one of the grooves that stick out from the hold. This one, the climber can place the fingertips behind the edge of that hold and must secure the grip before dropping the weight in which he will have to engage into a pull-up. In order for the climber to make that reach, the climber had positioned the right foot onto the foot chip and has pressed down on it so he can stay stable as he committed on pushing on the lower foot so that the climber was able to gain direction for the reach. The climber, once securing the match, he glances down at the feet. And this one because the climber is performing a foot switch. He must continue to apply pressure at the grip and have continued to adjust it onto a slight pull-ups before bringing the left foot to come into a match. It's important that the climber, glancing down at the feet, continues to apply pressure at the feet so he doesn't lose the foot placement and he's bringing the left toe to come into place first, apply pressure before releasing the right foot from its place. It was smart of the climber to move out of his open crimp. This one being a much smaller hold is more difficult to sustain. And he keeps the right hand in position on the squeeze in order to sustain the move. Sending the left hand over to the next hold, which has a sharp lip in the inside of the hold. This moment, the climber is placing two fingers on it, which are the middle finger and the ring finger to give space, potentially to bring the hand over to a match onto that hold. As the climber had jumped off on his left foot, he has lost contact with the hold and now the left leg is being extended. This is called back flagging as the climber's left leg is folded behind the right foot being in place and is using it right now to gain stability over the move as well as continuing to having the body twist of his left side towards the wall helps the climber to keep his center of gravity closed by keeping also that left leg extended and sending his center of gravity over to be supported by the high foot being in place. The climber brings the right foot that was out on the flag to come into a high foot placement, bringing it over the small hold that he was sustaining before at the start hold. This is a foot chip, so the climber will be placing the toe towards the edge of the hold. And in order to utilize this hold, he will have to push away on the hold in order to extend his body over to the next hold at reach. The climber having the extension of the right leg is called flagging out and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place which helps him to keep balance as well as stabilizing his position. If the climber attempted this again, he needs to make sure that he glances down at the foot when making the foot placement which he did however the transfer of Bearing weight onto that left foot placement was quick as he elevated the right leg immediately and the moment that the climber Pull himself in on the grips Had released some of the pressure on the foot. So it's important that the climber constantly creates pressure at that left foot placement when Engaging onto that pull up to make the move The climber is starting at a two-hand hold start. Each hold is different, the right hand being more positive as the climber has more surface for the climber to place the fingers on. The right hand is a pinch hold since the climber is bringing the thumb onto one side of the hold and will be engaging it into a squeeze to apply pressure to the hold. On the left hand, we can see the climber is holding onto a much smaller hold. This one is called a crimp hold since the climber only has a very small edge at the top of the hold where he will be placing the pads of his fingertips to be placed on top of the area of the hold. In order to sustain it, he will have to close the grip by bringing the palm towards the hold. The knuckles will be sticking out to apply force to it. The climber needed to secure the grips so that he was able to make the left foot placement inside of the hold. At this time, the climber's left foot had placed the toe inside of the hole and is pressing towards the right side of the edge away from it in order to secure the foot placement. And releases the right leg to go out on an extension. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. The flagging out will help the climber to keep in balance when on the position as well as balancing over his areas of support which will be the right hand and the left foot being in place when performing the move. It can be tiring for the climber to often have to engage the arms by performing the pull ups in order to adjust the grip. This one because the climber needs to make space for the right hand to come into place. The climber releases the left hand from its place before committing to the move to shake it. This, with the arm extended, is called being on a rest position as the climber is not engaging on a pull-up right now and is only sustaining onto the grip. The climber releases the left hand to shake so that he can release any tension that may build up on his hand as this is a very strenuous way of gripping onto the hold with just placing a few fingers. The climber brings the right hand to a match at the hold. This one is a pocket due to only fitting so many fingers at a time to match the hold. For the movement of the body, the climber has brought the right knee to come inward so that he's able to bring his center of gravity close to the wall. In sustaining the hold, we can see how he's only sustaining the hold with a few fingers at a time to bring it over to a match. This is also a sharp hold and only using a few fingers can be very strenuous for the tendons of the hand. The climber was sitting on the mat and I believe he did a step up start meaning he placed one foot first then placed the other one slightly higher and is no longer on the mat. Then the climb now starts.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So he gets this right foot up. So now he's got a right hand right foot. So he's not opposite pose and you'll notice that as he kind of hits it his body wants to swing the barn door out. So he could have committed a little bit harder to his back leg or try to get his left foot up. But he's able to hold it, kind of regain that position. He's able to kind of move fast enough to kind of fight the barn door. But that's kind of a good example of where he could have tensioned out even further. Back leg out to the left or out to the right even more with the left foot. So here you can see he was able to make that match and he's adjusting, but he's keeping really good tension down on the toes so he's taking most of his weight to his feet, maintaining that position and balance and tension, which just makes it easier to do all this with his hands. So here we can see these holds are pretty challenging and he kind of bends his arms in to get his feet on the wall but then once the feet are on the wall they immediately go to straight and he kind of sinks down into those feet so he's really doing a good job keeping tension through his toes and it's really sinking down and staying on top of those footholds. I really like this move. So he hits this hold, still really tension on the feet. And once he gains control of it, he just shifts his entire weight to the left. This hold is kind of on that positive plane. So he's kind of as perpendicular to it as he can get. But it lets him straighten his arm out, relax, and just kind of rely on friction and the position to hold him there instead of having to pull himself up onto it. So now he's looking where he's supposed to go so he sees the next hold. He's in this nice kind of almost twist lock technique so he's on the on the left foot. He's really on the right hand. Left hand is kind of stabilizing but he's kind of got this flagged out right foot keeping tension against the wall. It's a really good position really nice and balanced but also tensioned out. Here we can see he's kind of purposely leaving room in here so he's hitting this with just two fingers so that way he can get his other hand up here to make the move up to this next big pink one. But we'll watch him as he hits it so he's kind of engaged but as he gets control of it, he's going to shift his weight underneath it so that way he can hang directly below it, push with the feet. And so the feet, so he's kind of just hanging out in a good position and is able to kind of move this right hand up without losing control of his body or having his body position shift.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They're able to Lerp up into this kind of awkward hold And this climbers, I just think grabbing it in a weird way. I think that there might actually be a better Hand position for this hold but nevertheless they are on it So here I have the climber at the start of this boulder, left hand on this mini crimp and right hand on this nice brick pinch. They've also got a couple feet down here and I think that there's a foot over here as well for this move. After another tenuous match on this pink hold, the climber was able to get a backstep in on this Waco crimp and attempt a move out left, but the foot slips and the climber falls to the ground. I think that there's a better way to match this hold. The climber seems to be trying to match the exact spot that the left hand is in, but I think that there are more options that might help the climber to speed up this sequence. Granted you might not get the perfect hand position for the right hand because the left hand is there, but I do think that rolling out into this hold here is not super difficult, so I'm just sort of giving some take here that needs to happen from the climber. And here you see the climber tenuously matching. Got two fingers here for the left hand. And then I think that they're actually getting three in on the right, but this is a piano match. So you're dropping one digit and adding another from the hand that you want to be on the hold. And like sort of lifting up on a key and pressing down with the other hand. That's why they call it the piano match.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So in this case, the climber needs to continue to apply pressure on that heel hook by pulling down on it. And heel hooks are strong because they can also sustain a series of moves or one big powerful move while being in place. The climber is sending the right leg that was extended on the flag to bring his right foot up for a high foot placement. As we can see, he's bringing it over to a match where the right hand is, sending the heel into place behind the edge that sticks out from the hold. This is called heel hooking, so the climber could use the heel hook placement once placed to push down the heel towards the hold, as well as pulling away from the wall by having it catch by the edge of that hold to secure, once the heel placement is secured. Now having that pull motion will help the climber to keep his center of gravity close to the wall as the leg will be bended and he will be engaging on the thigh force. This is a very strong type of foot placement as the climber will be able to use it almost like a third hand and is using the biggest muscle in the body being on the thigh when engaged. As soon as the climber made the right foot placement, he is bringing his knee to come inwards, slightly dropping the knee so that the climber is able to transition his right side of the body to get close to the wall in order to release the right hand to come into a match at the same hold. The climber had adjusted the left hand to only place a few fingers onto the edge of the hold. This is a small pocket, so the climber is able to place an entire fingers of the hand behind the edge of the hold, but because this one is sharp and it's a small, the climber is bringing both of them in a match, reason why the climber keeps pushing over his finger placement over to the left side of the hold to bring the right hand for the fingers to come into a match. He's only placing about two fingers to three fingers to each one of the hands in order to sustain the hold above. And as we can see, he is engaging into a pull position in order to apply pressure and also to release pressure as he adjusts the grip. So if the arm is engaged to give pressure to the grip, it's to release pressure from one hand and he does this back and forth where then the other one will engage into a pull up to apply pressure to release some of the pressure of the other hand. Once the climber is able to find a comfortable placement, then he will be able to move the The climber, in feeling the hold and trying to make the move, he's adjusting the feet and brings now the hands onto a match at the same hold. Both of them are being pinched so that he's able to transition his left hand out of the hold. The climber right now is spending some time readjusting the grips at the edge of that hold and as we can see only the fingertips are able to curl in behind the edge of that hold making it difficult for the climber to find space once he made that transition of the right hand so he is trying to move over his left hand over as much as he can to the left side in order to make the next move. Now the left leg being extended this is called flagging out because the climbers able to transition over the weight to the right foot being in place and him having the leg extended helps the climber to keep his left side of the body towards the wall to help when releasing the left hand to the next move. The climber was able to send the left hand up for one of the ridges that stick out on the large hold and able to place the fingertips behind one of those ridges. Now the climber is able to secure the grip then drops the weight by extending the arm and now it's glancing over at his feet. This one to perform a foot switch. As we can see the climber is continuing to hold on with the right hand with a few fingers inside of the pocket. This one because the climber had already just moved the left hand from its place and we can see it sustaining only two fingers on the hold being the middle finger and the ring finger. To not waste energy to reposition his fingers in placement he is just focusing right now on the foot switch since he just applied the left hand onto the grip. For the foot switch the climber is bringing the right toe to come into place above the left toe and he is bringing the foot over the other and this is called the magician's tablecloth because the climber places the foot above and yet to apply any pressure onto the hold the climber again slides the left foot out. The reason why the climber is engaging in some of the power right now the grips to release some of the pressure down at the feet. However the climber needs to continue to have contact with the foothold so he doesn't slip out of his foot placement. As soon as the climber removes the left foot then he will bring the right foot that is just over the left foot to bring the right foot to push hard into that foothold to stay in place. If the climber was going to do this again, ideally would be that he focuses on continue to apply pressure at that heel hook when making the transition of the right hand up for the jug. Heel hooks can be tricky to release as well as if they release unintentionally because they apply a lot of force to the move and the climber must be intentional about releasing the heel hook in order to sustain a move. The climber was trying to make the right foot placement to come into a smear, place the toe onto the hold, however it wasn't successful at it and his weight was dropping. The twist of his body is because the climber right now is positioning himself to land safely onto the mat as he already is performing a twist while sustaining to the grips. The climber in wanting to go up for the next move, he releases the right foot from the foot placement and has extended the right leg. This is called flagging out and it will help the climber to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. Now the climber is repositioning to be much higher the right foot so he is able to bring it over closer to the areas of support as keeping the right leg extended will help the climber eventually to press on the toe against the wall for him to sustain the move once he gets much closer to the wall on his left side. The climber quickly moves the right hand out of matching the pinch hold where the left hand was to a more promising hold as a jug is. This one because it has a large lip so the climber could be able to place the fingertips behind the lip of the hold. However when he made this transition of one move and has another one consecutively this is called bumping after making one move so he bumped up to the jug. At the moment that the climber bumped to the jug we can see him only being able to catch the very edge of the hold so he must pull himself in once more to release some of the pressure at the right hand in order to place it further. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start in which he's crossing his arms to place the left hand over to the right side on a larger hold as the right hand also on a smaller hold. He does this placement intentionally as he would need to move over out to the left and releasing the left hand potentially as it's the one that is placed above. Now the climber will start until the climber is no longer standing on the mat and feet are placed onto the wall. The climber, once securing the heel hook, he drops the left foot from its place and is glancing over to what the next move he needs to encounter, potentially to make the left foot come into place before releasing the right hand. As the climber secured the pressure on the left toe placement, he was able to extend the right leg with the foot pointing out. This is again called flagging out and helps the climber to transition the weight over to the foot being in place as well as helping the climber on balancing over his body positioning which helps the climber when extending the right leg to help with the extension of the left hand going out to the grip. The type of grip that the climber went up to is a pinch hold as he's able to press the thumb onto one side of the hold while remaining the fingers on the outer or in the other side of that edge of the hold. Now the climber must squeeze on the hold in order to secure the grip and extending the arm will help the climber to then drop the weight onto the highest grip. At this point, the climber had spent sufficient time engaging the upper body, mostly on the shoulders to the arms itself, all the way up to the fingertips, and was able to find that adjustment where the climber could then trust the grips to lean back and extend the arms. The arms extended means that the climber is on a rest position where he's not engaging any longer on the arms and just leans back onto the grips. This was so the climber was able to now focus on the feet being in place, bringing the left foot much higher than the right foot to then be ready to move up for the next hold. Now the climber must take a break here as he had already engaged so long on the upper body. So glancing over, taking a moment to rest before performing the next move would be ideal. Or if the climber has the energy, he can try to move up quickly to the next move, but it depends on what type of holds he will be encountering, if they are positive or if they are going to be difficult holds where he will have to engage his arms for quite some time. The climber making the move of bumping up for the high placement, he pressed hard on the heel hook. However, once placing the grip, that took over transferring the weight and the climber lost the heel hook from its position. Now the climber must try to sustain to the holds tightly in order to recover bringing the feet back into place. So in this case, the climber is engaging on the core, holding tight on the grips, he is engaging on the bend of the arms to try to lift up the feet to bring the toe into place because it will be very difficult for the climber to replace the heel hook at this point. So he could be smearing against large hold or try to position the toe into one of the ridges to sustain the move. So the climber, immediately after making the application of the right hand onto the pinch hold, sends the left hand for the next move at reach. And we can see how he's also had transition his foot placement by extending the left leg and having the toe touch against the wall while the right foot is in place. As he's right hand and right foot were the ones in contact with the wall to give support for the climber during the move, the left leg extended helps the climber to keep balance and stability over the move, as this is called back flagging, in order for him to bring his center of gravity close to the wall when at the reach. So having that left leg extended also helps the climber to keep his left side towards the wall when making the reach. The climber has started the climb, places the feet onto the wall, and right now we can see how the climber's left hand is placed in a much bigger hold and is held as a pinch as we're able to see the thumb placed on the other side of the hold while the fingers lay onto the other one. The climber must create a pull motion while sustaining the grip by leaning on the hold. On the other hand, the climber is sustaining into a closed grip, this one being a much smaller hold. Climber is applying the fingertips above the hold and closing the grip as he keeps the palm flat towards the wall, potentially over the hold as he's gripping onto. This one being a crimp due to the climber's knuckles sticking out to engage power onto the fingers being in place and the thumb placed onto the side. Grips can provide a lot of power as long as the climber also sustains the elbow close to the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So you can see the positive edge is kind of at a slant, but once he gets a good grip on it, immediately kind of sinks his weight down to the left. So that way he's kind of opposing it. And you can see the positive kind of, you know, the holds maybe like that. So he is pretty perpendicular to the positive edge of the hold. And what that's letting him do is really sink and own the position and let his feet drive into the holds. So he's not trying to fight it and pull up on his feet. And here you can see, so he gets this hold. Once he gets a good grip on it, he immediately shifts his weight to the left. So now he's hanging directly underneath it. His arms are straight, so he's not pulling himself off the wall. He's really sinking into that position and really loading up his feet. And unfortunately, he's just not able to get his feet back on. It's hard to say if he would have made it further. He kind of looks just tired, but it's hard to say if he would have made it further if he'd been a little bit fresher and maybe reset at the start. But what he did learn was valuable. So he can now rest and do a start with the proper technique next time. Now you can kind of see his feet kind of run out. He's got this kind of big kind of slanted hold here, so kind of perfect for a heel hook. It's above his head. And what that heel is going to let him do is kind of pull straight through the whole hold with his foot. And that's going to free up his right hand to kind of move up and move as it kind of freely. So instead of having to push a toe into the hold, he's going to be able to kind of treat it like another hand and kind of really pull in with that heel and pull himself, his weight up and his hips up. So he kind of starts off with some alternative beta. He's got his hands flopped around. He's going up, up into the left. It's kind of this weird pocket hold right here. And so he kind of starts in this crisscrossed position and isn't able to actually move from it, but he is able to save it and then get readjusted that matching. So it kind of shows some good problem solving and thinking on the wall. You know, if something doesn't feel right and you don't feel you can commit to it, you know, quickly going, I think either you gotta like commit to something or move and change things fast. Again, kind of getting this twist lock technique where he's opposite post, right hand on, left foot on, with this right foot kind of flaking out. You can see it's pointed and kind of digging into that wall, pushing against it, kind of smearing. Here we can see him getting opposite of pose. He's got right hand down, left foot on. He's kind of almost doing a twist lock. So he's twisting that left hip into the wall, kind of bring his torso into his arm, not fully into his arm. And then that right leg is flaking out, but it's providing a little bit of tension. So it is towing and smearing into the wall. And that's going to kind of give him power to move up and left. So yeah, here we can see he kind of really adapts the whole time. He's really able to load up his feet. I'm sure like this kind of mixing it up at the start is going to cost him some strength and power later on. But he does seem to change and get into this new position pretty quickly and without really hesitating. So kind of moving quick on his feet is a good thing too. So kind of, you know, either commit to the move or figure out the next position you want to commit to.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They never had a great purchase on it. The heel or the toe was sticking straight up when realistically that should be wrenched over. The toe should be pointing this way. That's what's gonna allow the hips to get a little bit higher. So you're not so far below the crosshold here. You can see these hips are bending down, moving to the left, which is taking them off of the heel. And so a difficult position when the heel slips. After getting the match good, the climber was able to do a little bit of footwork, get left hand up into this pink hold here, and then getting the right foot on the left hand start hold, the crimp, the climber is able to come in and match on this hold here. Here we have the climber one move into this boulder. We're down here on these two holds here. And actually started crossed but ended up matching this hold. And then we're able to move the left hand up into this Waco crimp here. After another difficult match here on this pink hold, the climber was able to bring their left foot up and in to the Waco crimp here, and that's what enabled them to go out left to this decent hold here. You can see they're making some movement with their right foot here in anticipation of a hand-foot match on this right hold. You can see them matching this hold, just two fingers on the right hand and bumping digits out on the left to try and make room for the right. So tenuous match, but definitely going about it in a good way.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He's bringing the right toe to come into place where the left toe is and once the climber creates pressure onto that right foot placement then he will be able to release the left foot from its place. The climber taking advantage of the swing he then engages onto a pull up and tie and zap the cord to engage the feet up onto a rise placing the feet inside of the sloth to hook the toes behind the edge of the hold. Now all of the limbs right now are matching onto the same edge and it's important that the climber tries to transition his weight over to the toe placement. As the climber is hooking the toes behind the edge of the hold he must try to lower his center of gravity to secure the foot placement. The left leg extended. This is called flagging out and is helping the climber to continue to stay in balance when transferring the weight over to the areas of support. At this moment the climber is bringing the right knee to come inwards to support the climbers body on the twist as he's placing the right hand as an under grip. The climber is continuing to be on the same areas of support, the left foot being in place and the right hand. When the climber makes two moves consecutively but after making a move makes one more, this is called bumping. So the climber has bumped out of the sloper to the large edge. The climber again is glancing down to make a new foot placement, bringing the left foot that was out on the flag to be positioned at the block where the start hold is. Because this one is large on the edge, the climber can comfortably place the front toe area of the foot to surface the top of the hold. Once the climber gets to create pressure between the left foot placement and the hold, then the climber will be able to release the right foot being at reach as he is completely extended. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet, especially when doing a foot switch. The hold down below is a large hold so the climber moves the ankle out in order to allow space for the right foot to come in. Once the climber gets to apply pressure onto the right toe, then he will be able to release the left foot from its place. And the climber making the reach out left. We can see how his right leg continued to be extended and he actually had pressed the toe against the wall in order to sustain the move, as well as helping the climber with the rotation of keeping his center of gravity close to the wall. When the climber is sustaining to a sloper it's important that he continues to keep his center of gravity beneath the hold. As we can see the climber is looking at the hold at this sense and is sending his left knee to come inwards. This is so that he can prepare to bump up for the next move to come out of the sloper hold which is not a very promising hold to sustain for a long period of time due to the way of sustaining it is limited. So he's aiming to stand up over on the left foot bringing the knee inwards so that he can bring his left side towards the wall keeping his center of gravity with it to bump over to the promising edge. The climber is bringing the left hand up for the next hold. This one is rounded and it's called a sloper. Slopers can be tricky to hold on to because they don't have any edges. In this case, this type of hold does have some grooves in it where the climber can get to apply some gripping power by curling the fingertips into the hold edges or grooves. So the climber first places the palm on top of the hold and arches the fingertips in order to create friction between the skin and the hold. Once the climber gets a catch of it, he must drop the weight on the grip. The climber was matching onto the hold hands and feet and was able to drop the weight by extending the legs and continuing to apply the toe hook. Due to the climber having length of his arms he was able to do this and after release the right hand in order to make the transition over to the last hold. The climber right now continues to hold on with the left hand over at the edge of the hold where his toe hook is and so the climber must continue on the extent of the bath hang and not lose pressure by bending the knees in order to make the transition over to the last hold. The climbers is starting at a one-hold start, meaning that both of the hands are at the same hold. This is called matching. The climber places the fingers above the edge of the hold and brings the thumbs at the bottom of it. So that the climber is able to engage gripping power by squeezing on the hold. This is a step-up start. Once the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing in the mat, then the climb will start. The climber releasing the right foot from its placement, he's now cutting feet and this time the back is facing the wall. In this instance, the climber must pull himself into the hold in order to sustain the swing. Now the climber is engaging onto a pull up to also engage onto having gripping power. Once he's stabilizing himself, he will bring his foot into place. The climber has dropped the left foot, this to keep the left leg extended, to bring the center of gravity over to the left side to remain underneath the left hand grip. As we can see the climber's right hand has been released from his hand placement because he will be bringing it over to the edge of the hold. At this moment the climber has sent the right foot to be out into space with the leg extended. This is so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in position. This is called flagging out in which the climber will continue to use until he gets to make the transition of his left hand over to the next hold. The climber must demonstrate controlling the stability over his body position as well as when presenting the match at the last hold. If the climber is able to do this, then the climb is completed. The climber in order to make the right hand going up for the reach, he has extended the left leg. This is called flagging out. So the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. And has positioned the right knee to be facing inwards so the climber is able to keep his right side towards the wall, helping with the reach. The left leg extended also helps the climber to stay in balance and gain stability over the position when making the move. Once the climber had pressed on his left foot, he was able to bring his right foot to a rise and also bring his center of gravity close to the wall as it's transferred over to the highest foot being in place. The right leg is being extended so that the climber is able to bring his hips as square towards the wall as he made the move out to the next hold. The left hold is also sustained as a pinch hold that is vertical so the climber engages on another pinch where he squeezes onto the hold in order to create pressure. He is leaning back in order to transfer over the weight to the grip.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So you can see that his knee is facing out to the left, but then as he pulls up, he switches the knee into the right, and that kind of twists his hip into the wall. And he's twisting his left hip into the wall, which is kind of letting him bring his left hand up closer to the wall. So it's kind of just keeping his whole left side of the body tight to the wall so he can reach with a little bit more ease. So he's doing a good job starting keeping his arms nice and straight loading up the feet and then kind of sinking down into the feet so you can really drive the feet you know he's not pulling himself up from the get-go so he started from a really stable nice position in which he's not fighting and he's able to kind of smooth and kind of set the tone for the rest of the route making sure those arms are nice and straight and he's not because if he starts pulling up with his arms he's gonna pull tension away from his feet so he really wants to keep the tension on his feet and lead with those feet Now he's doing a bat hang, so that's where he's going to use the tops of his toes to kind of put pressure down through the hold. You kind of use friction to stay on. That's going to let him kind of go hands free and move his hands down the wall to kind of finish on this hold over here. So it lets him take all of his weight to his feet and frees up his arms to do this kind of committing and cool move. Now you can see him kind of getting opposite pose, but as he does it, you know, he keeps his arms nice and straight So he's not Bending in pulling himself off the holds. So he's kind of staying in a super nice relaxed position still tensed He swaps those feet. So now he's gonna be anchored on with the left hand tone at the right The left foot is kind of sticking out here flagging into the wall So it's kind of smearing into the into the wall to kind of give him some push Kind of a system kind of moving up through his feet so you can move his right hand", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And after getting the toe hooks in good, the climber is able to come in and match this hold in an inverted position called a bat hang.

Now the climber is glancing over at a hold that reach and you can see the climber is keeping a wide stance with one foot higher than the other to trust the grips at this moment by leaning back to keep the arms extended. This is called a rest position because the climber is able to send his center of gravity over to his stance by bringing the hips closer and leaning back in order to extend the arms. This is called resting because the climber is not engaging the arms into a pull up and only relying on the grips. When the climber is ready then he will step up over the highest foot and send the next hand up for the move. The climber after holding on to the hole that reached being the pinch, he has adjusted his left foot. This one because when he first put it into place, he had placed the foot above the hold from the middle of the foot by the arch. So in this time, the climber has readjusted the foot placement to move the foot back so that the hold is placed underneath the ball area of the foot. The climber is bringing the right hand to a match, so the climber must demonstrate controlling his stability over sustaining the last hold with both hands, as well as continuing to be stable at his body positioning. Once the climber is able to demonstrate this, then the climb is completed. The climber trusting the left hand already sustaining onto the last hold is able to apply a pinch on the grip. This one by sending the fingertips behind the edge of the hold as well as the thumb. Once the climber secures the grip he's able to lean back to extend the arm. Now to transfer over the weight down at the feet by leaning back. As the climber is on a small foothold he needs to make sure that he applies pressure onto that right foot coming into place to not lose the placement. On this one the climber we can see rolling his left ankle outwards in order to create space for the right toe to come in. And because this foot switch is a distance it's important the climber glances down at the feet. The climbers are starting at a two-hand hold start, each hand sustaining to a different type of grip. With the left hand, we can see how the climber is sustaining to a jug as he's able to place the fingers behind the edge of the hold onto a thick lip. And onto the right hand, the climber is sustaining to a much larger hold in which he gets to place the fingers above the hold with the thumb on the other side, spreading the fingers as the climber is sustaining to a sloper hold where he must create friction between the hold and the skin. Now the climber is doing a step-up start, so once the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall, then the climb will start. The climber engages into a small pull-up to bring his right foot to a slight higher foot placement as it was down below. This is for the climber to get himself positioned ready to make the next move. Now the climber brings the right toe to be pushed against the wall, meeting the edge of the shoe against the wall. This is called smearing and will help the climber generate movement and push when pressing onto the wall. As he slightly wants to make the adjustment of placing the foot, he lowers his center of gravity slightly and engages again into another pull-up to bring himself up to the next move. Once the climber gains height, his right foot would no longer be in touch with the wall and will be with the leg extended. This will be called flagging out as the climber will be able to transition the weight over to the highest foot being in place. It helps the climber also keep balance when making the movement to the hold at reach. The climber was struggling to make a right foot placement and sends the left hand for another move. This is called bumping after the climber has already done a move and does a second one consecutively on the same stance. In this case, the climber had continued to press over on that left foot and keeping the right leg extended. This is called flagging and it transfers over the weight to the foot being in place. Flagging also helps the climber to keep his center of gravity close to the wall as he right now when going up for bumping up to the move, he is keeping his hips square when sustaining onto the right hold. The climber sends the left foot to be placed at a high foot stance. Now he placed the foot above the hold from the middle of the foot by the arch and rolls the toe down in order to secure the foot placement. The climber making the choice of the left foot coming up high helps the climber to keep his center of gravity being on the core to stay close to the wall as making the high foot placement locks him there in order to stay in position for making the transition of the right hand up to the pinch grip. Now as we can see in this movement when he's pulling himself in having the right foot lower helps the climber to keep his right side towards the wall helping at the reach.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He's not trying to pull up with his arms and kind of overcompensate with his arms. He's really letting himself sink down into the feet and really starting from a good stable position. Here you can see he's also doing a good job of staying opposite of pose. So he doesn't always have two feet on at all times. He could, he could try to kind of twist and like keep both feet on and keep them balanced. But a lot of times you'll see him drop a foot. So right now he is reaching up with his left hand. And so he's holding out his right. So that means he's towing with his left. And he's kind of doing this opposite of pose. So he's reaching up with his left hand. So his right foot is kind of flagging straight down. He's kind of got a point on either side of his body that stays balanced. So it's kind of his, the opposite limbs are doing kind of mimicking each other to kind of be in a stable position. Another thing that this allows is this right foot. It's not just on nothing. It's kind of smearing into the wall and applying pressure. And you can kind of smear that foot in to kind of drive the weight.

So this left hand jug is actually pulling this way and then this foot is pushing this way. So there's some opposition here and with this left foot out here, counterbalancing the right hand, it makes it very easy for the climber to go up into this two-fold. The climber then touches this crimp here and just kind of reassessing where they're at, they are able to just move the left hand up into this jug.

And as you can see while being placing on the foot down below, this one is not only being pressed down, but it's also being pressed away from the hole so that the climber can be pushed slightly out to the right. Also the foot being, the high foot being the right foot, will help the climber to gain reach once the climber gets to stand up. And while the left leg is not placed on any holes, it's actually being used as a tail for balance. So this type of movement of the leg out and not any holes is called flagging out. Here we can see the climber starting at a hand match, one hold start. This, the climber will start by pulling on the hold above, keeping the arms extended, and once the feet are placed on the wall, then the climb starts. Before the climber reached up to the move above, we saw the climber hesitating by doing a series of mini pull-ups until convinced to make the move above. This can actually tire the climber out if waiting too long to make such dynamic moves. Here we can see how the climber brings over the right toe to a foothold. This one, they bring over the foot from being positioned down below and right to in front of it and across the left side. This is because the climber will need to be positioned with a slight layback as the hold that's been held above with the left hand is with the lip on to facing the left side.

So in this case, they could really twist that knee in, force that hip into the wall, and then get their weight over that foot, so that way all they have to do is drive up the wall using the lower body and kind of pivot around this anchoring left hand. So it starts off in a pretty good position. His arms are nice and straight. Their arms are nice and straight. The body's nice and staggered. The hips are kind of close, or further from the wall. So I feel like he could, they could twist their hip closer to the wall. Kind of pivot around this point. But overall not a bad way to start. Maybe he could get a little bit closer to the wall. In this instance, we can see they don't really, they twist their knee in, but they don't stand up at all. So it's all in this arm. And then when the arm isn't able to get them up high enough, their whole body kind of collapses and loses tension away from the wall. So that's a good example of where you want to twist in and really stand up through your feet and not just kind of passively weight the feet without keeping tension. You want to really engage and drive the toes. So he kind of, or they kind of just stayed on the wall. And yeah, they did all the pulling with their upper body and kind of ignored the lower body. I think the lower body was in a good position, but they didn't utilize it all. So they had like one half of the puzzle without really driving through the lower body. Again, hits this first move, keeps arm nice and straight, is engaged to the upper body. Looks like the core is nice and engaged. You can see them looking down at their feet and kind of walking their feet through. So not a bad first couple moves.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

But they hesitate and they're not really willing to generate movement by penduluming down before releasing back up towards this hold. They end up just kind of pulling through after a few hesitations. They're able to reach the hold but they're at full extension with their body pulling away from the wall. And even though it's a positive hold, that may be enough to actually pull them off. So we see a climber begin the attempt following along with the judges. They use a laser pointer to point out the sequence. Climbers pantomiming the moves with their hands, kind of looking at their expected hand position and sequence through the problem. The more they have this memorized and identified from the ground, the more efficient they'll be able to climb on the wall. Climber pulls into the start move, good rotation with the left hip to reach up with the left arm. That lets them pull from a relatively straight arm position and is less straining on the finger muscles.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

You can also see that they're losing or have lost this left hand that used to be on this hold and so they're currently falling. They just didn't quite get high enough. Realistically their hips should be up here and their shoulder should be locked in order to maintain tension on the wall. The climber then surfs up into this left hand jug. This is directional, so the usable surface is going this direction, but because it's such a good hold, you can kind of just stick your fingers in there and maintain this straight arm. And the climber's obviously still in the right hand hold here, but most of their weight is going through this left arm now. So you have the climber looking at the boulder, miming some of the moves here. I'm just trying to gain an intention on how to complete this boulder. The climber then steps the right foot through the plane of the body and shifts the hips over to the right here and that's allowing them to gain even more usable surface through this jug. You notice another straight arm here looking up at the target hold. So here I have the climber matched up on this hold, which is actually an old voodoo jug. It's a brand that doesn't exist anymore, but they make really cool holds that end up on spray walls a lot. This is a voodoo hold. This is a voodoo hold. Voodoo is very popular. Anyway, left foot, pasting on the wall on a foothold, and just pretty relaxed, straight arms, looking up at the target hold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

As well, it's important that the climber can read two steps ahead to follow what sequence the climber must make in order to follow the route. The climber did spend quite some time figuring out what their footwork would be, the reason why the grip no longer was the best strength, the reason why the climber came off the wall. Here the climber is glancing over to see what the next move is. The climber originally had placed their feet at a high position but has not thought well on what position for your feet is best before making the next move. So the climber has to scan the wall, has made some adjustments with the feet and is still finding what is the next hold in order to do the next foot placement. Having a strong foot placement either as in a foot chip can generate a lot of power since it's bringing power from the thighs rather than the arms in the case they get tired. Here, the climber, in order to reach up to the next move, had to create generating power to swing out left. Now, the hips must remain close to the wall, but also a motion of the movement to be dynamic to swing over the arm up left. Most of the pressure must be generated from the right foot as the climber swings over and hangs on onto the undercling, creating a camming position with the left hand and pushing down forcefully with the right foot. At this point, even though the climber has gotten to the next hold outright, has it spent already so much time positioning the feet? Something about bouldering and figuring out a problem is that the climber must be following a sequence in order to work efficiently throughout the wall. Otherwise, if the climber does take a lot of time standing in one move, it can tire the climber out. Here when we see the climber releasing the hand off the grip, it's because the climber is feeling the hands getting tired or losing the grip. Reason why the hand lift and reposition to the hold is to reposition for a better grip. Here we can see the climber mimicking the moves of what the climb would be like. This can help the climber visualize what the route would look or feel like as the climber can plan from the ground before getting on the wall. It's good for the climber that while they make a thought out decision for their foot placement, they're using the hold down below, which both feet are matching on the same big hold, which is a no brainer for the climber until they can get the right foot placement before moving on. Here we can see the climber has both hands on the same hold again matching. And in this instance, the hand that's placed above, it's sustaining with an open palm, and the fingers behind the hold are the ones creating the pressure while the climber performs the lean back. For the right hand, it's placed underneath again as an undercling, but it's using the thumb, which is used as a pinch. This can help for the climber to keep a better grip. Again, the climber is holding in, but in this instance, the right hand or the arm would say it's bended. And this is because the climber is bringing their body and center of gravity close to the wall as the climber performs bringing up their feet, which they need to release pressure in order to work with locating the feet at a higher stance. And the left foot that was placed first at a higher stance was then swapped with the right foot. Here we can see the climber holding on to our start hold. When both hands are in the same start hold, this is called matching, and we can see how the climber is placing the hands with palms facing up. When a hold is held this way, this is called an undercling, where the climber will have to push the hands towards the hold up and then pull away by leaning back. Now it's really important that the climber keeps the elbows close to the core to sustain the move as the climber will work their feet up. Since this is a start, first the climber will need to get in position by placing both of the feet on the wall and so once both of the feet are off the ground, then the climb will start. Now being in an undercling, the climber can sustain this for quite some time and move the feet up or find a position where it still sustains the layback in order to move to the next hold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

You can kind of see her glancing up in this direction. And you can see that her left foot's kind of naturally going into this position. And you can see that she wants to kind of smear and push with this left foot to drive her up and right. But she never fully utilizes this left foot. So this is a good example of like how you can not have your foot on anything, but it can still create tension and kind of push you. So all she has to do is kind of toe and dig her foot into the wall here. And that little bit of friction caused by her rubber kind of smearing against the wall is going to be enough to kind of get her body weight over to the right. So that way she can push up and off that right foot. But yeah, she kind of doesn't. She kind of just ends up pivoting around this hole, switching her feet around, and ultimately kind of trying to create the movement with her arms. And then she's just not able to. She spent so long trying to create this momentum with her upper body instead of just driving with her lower body. She's just unable to sustain the movement. So here we can see she's starting a pretty good position. She's starting on this big kind of purple undercling. You can see her palms are facing upwards. So she's kind of pulling herself in, but she's, so when she's grabbing this hold, she's not pulling down, she's kind of pulling, or there's like kind of pulling up against the hold. So this is kind of an undercling or an undercut. You can see she's keeping her arms nice and straight, kind of leaning back from the wall. And that's going to kind of drive her feet down into the wall and kind of pressure and keep tension through her toes. And hopefully she'll be able to kind of pivot around her feet and keep these arms nice and straight to like pivot up and hit the higher holds. Yeah, she spends so much time. So she eventually does hit this hold. But it's all in her upper body. So she eventually just kind of falls off the wall. So you can see as she makes the first move, she's almost got a big flat hole with her left, and she's able to keep her arm nice and straight. Still keeping a little bit of tension at the right. And she's looking down kind of to find her next foot movements, but overall looking good.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So we see a climber begin the attempt pretty smoothly. Both hands are using these large kind of nostril shapes as double under clings. That under cling position is really powerful when the feet are on and the hips are above the hand and that's where they are here. So it makes it really easy for the climber to move left hand into this jog. So as the climber initiates the attempt, they're touching the holds and get called off by the judge, so they're not allowed to touch holds before the attempt. This is just general competition rule where they can get really close to it, you can try to visually think about what hand positions will feel like or what the hold texture may feel like, but touching the holds before the climb invalidates the attempt. So yeah, climbers are able to make this move relatively easily when they commit to it, but they just spent 15-20 seconds searching around for a foothold. That's very physically tiring even if they're on positive hold. So climber was in a position that would be usable to get out to this hold. Right foot facing left and the right hip turned in. If they drive in that direction, they can move out and catch this hold. But it is a somewhat dynamic catch and if the climber is hesitant, they want to be able to hold things statically because it feels more controlled, they'll avoid that move even though that's the most likely to be successful. So it's good we see while the climber is sequencing. Every few hand movements they kind of look back down indicating they're thinking about where the feet may be positioned in that next move, which is really important because one of the main areas we see climbers lose a sequence on a spray wall is in identifying the footholds that they have available.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Looks like a pretty comfortable position for the climber to be in. Karma's able to utilize this foot out here, which I don't know whether it's on or not, but they are able to pretty easily get out to this pinch hold to the right here. So the climber, in sussing around trying to figure out what to do with their feet here, they actually end up just putting their foot on a holdout here. I believe that this foothold is off, they're just using it because. And this would be considered like a dab if you touch something that's off on the boulder problem, but I think they're just trying to get through some moves here. So here you saw the climber touching these holds on the wall. And the judges who are officiating this competition told the climber that you are not allowed to touch the holds before you attempt the boulder. And this is a very common rule in competition climbing. You can only touch the start holds. So they may have given the climber an attempt on the scorecard for this. It might have just been a warning, I don't know, but that is what's happening. You can see here the climbers trying to get their toe into this bolt hole. That is the only thing that resembles an edge for this foot. It doesn't look like it's working out super well for this climber. Bolt holes are sometimes usable as feet. It doesn't look like in this situation it's quite in the right spot. So they're probably going to ideally smear their foot over here if they don't figure out another way to get their feet to work. The climber goes up and left into this tufa hold that they're not engaging the thumb on. It could just be because the hold is very slopey or it's just unnecessary, but they are choosing to wrap their wrist over this hold and just dangle on it. So here we have a undercling start hold, which means you need to put force up with both hands on this wall and the feet are going to allow the hips to stay higher. You're going to stand up into this nose hold here and that's going to gain usable surface. These moves are pretty hard. Undercling starts like this, you need a lot of bicep and you also need very good core to drive through the feet to get above the hold. And yeah, it's cool to see some diversity of movement from the setters on this boulder.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Here we can see the climber starting at a one hold start. This with both hands being placed in the same hold. The climber is then leaning over to the left side. This the climber needs to create force to keep themselves on the opposite side of the direction where the hold wants to be held and does this by applying pressure with their foot. As the climber is gaining extension and glancing over, the climber must be carefully thinking of the pressure applied on the foot in order to gain distance. Here, as the climber has reached the left hand up to the next hold, this one also being held with the applying the fingers towards the climber, being a side pose. The climber must keep remaining their position outright while holding the hold above.

The only thing again is her hips could be a little closer, especially on this starting hold where it's kind of a side pull. It's like she could really pivot around so that way she's kind of really pulling against the side pull. Then all she has to do is kind of push up through her feet and that would send her up and to the left. You can see she does a good job crossing herself through. You can see she's still kind of engaged on the left arm though. But here's another case where it's like she really could twist further in and really get her hip into the wall. And then all she has to do is really pull against this perpendicular to how this hold is set up. And if she pushed through her feet that would kind of send her straight up.

Unless they have very high shoulder engagement and shoulder strength, they can't do the move this way and as a result their feet pop off because they're fatigued.

This allows them to reach up with their left hand so the target holds from a straight arm position and little engagement on the right side.

We can tell that the climber was hesitating and had kept the arm extended for a series of small attempts of a pull-up to then push themselves up. However, the leg that was flagged out has dropped and when it drops it can significantly take the climber off the wall as the weight will come with it. So it's important that the climber engages the core and keeps the leg flagged out in order to sustain the position and not hesitate as long because it can tire the climber out. When the climber was reaching for the left hand up left, the climber was standing only on their left foot. The right foot was extended and just pointing towards the wall. This to keep a stability to get close to the wall. The foot being out, this is called flagging, which will help the climber with sustaining balance and extension as the climber does the reach. Here we can see the client recovering their hands with chalk. This is to have a better grip on the wall and also absorb any sweat that may be coming from their hands. The climber here is at a rest position where the only engagement on the upper body is coming from the grip, meaning that the muscles that are engaged are in the compartment of the forearm and not the entire arm is engaged, only the hand grip. So a rest position is when the arm is extended and the climber is not doing any pull-up position. At this moment is applying a lot of pressure on the top hold that the climber is sustaining at this moment. While doing this twist to place the right foot over the foothold, the climber is still remaining the left foot on the wall and thus a twist where it sends the foot over the left foot to then gain a sustained placement. Once the climber finds the foot positioning, then the climber can let go of the left foot.

Now the climber had quickly reached their right hand up and wasn't able to hold on to the thin edge with the outer side of their hand. Holding out with like the pinky in and on a pinch position can be difficult as most of the force on the hands are usually generated from the middle finger to the thumb. The climber failed to do the pinch and wasn't able to sustain the hold reason for the fall. Here the climbers are starting at a one-start hold, meaning that both hands must be placed on the same hold. When both hands are in the same hold, this is called matching. And as you can see, they're held wanting to be only on one side. For the climber to sustain this move, they must pull pressure away from the hold, going the opposite direction, leaning out left. And to support that, the climber must place their feet to help it push on that direction. So the foot that's being placed in this moment is the left foot, and the climber is turning the knee inwards to the right direction to keep the hip close to the wall. The climber then is positioned down low with arms extended so that the climber, one, glances over for what the next hold is, can do a powerful pull-up and press down onto the left foot, while the right foot at this moment is being extended. This is called flagging out and will help the climber with leverage and balance. It's good that the climber comes off from the first move quickly. This, the climber is still remaining their left foot onto the wall and crosses over the right foot over the left leg and steps at a high step. This one to prepare for the next move. Foot positioning by the toe, which is really important as the toe can create the most power and pressure in placement, as well as using the toe can help with pivoting in case the climber needs to go into pointing the knee out at a different direction.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Kind of looks like when she takes her right hand off, she may not fully bounce out and tensioned out. And then that causes her to lose the strength in her arm and fall off the wall. So here we can see a decent starting position, arms are nice and straight, feet are kind of staggered, hips could be brought in closer to the wall so this would probably be a good spot to kind of twist in since we know she's going up and to the left, getting that left hip into the wall so that way she can kind of smear and drive and just kind of pivot around. Really keep her arms nice and long and straight and really drive all that tension and force down into her toes. You can see she hits this first hole, then she's walking her feet through. Again, nice and straight, not fighting that position. This hole is kind of a side pull. So she's going to want to try to be as perpendicular to that as possible.

Left foot is placed, left hip is twisted in, and that allows the left arm to extend pretty straight into the first hold without having to engage too much on the right hand.

Here the climber has gained the extension to the reached move with the hold gripped above. Now the climber does this by mostly standing up on the left toe as the one that is placed the highest while the right leg is the one that has been extended and when the climber was going to go for the move going up the toe was pressing against the wall. This is for the climber to keep a balance as they get themselves pulled in. Here the climbers is starting at a one hold start meaning that both hands are placed on the same hold which is called matching. Now the hold is positive meaning that the climber is able to place the fingers behind the hold and he has a lip on it. Now the climb will start until the climber brings the feet off the mat. Here the climber lacked the reach to apply the right pressure on the hold above. This one the climber had to do a sort of wave out to skip the giant hold that is as an obstacle on the way to the reach. Another thing that the climber did well was to place the left foot where the right foot was, which is this very sustainable edge to apply the most pressure, and is keeping the hips in while doing this. Since the climber had brought the right foot on the flag, it was positioned right next to the other foot, the left foot, and this potentially had driven the climber off balance in order to get to the reach. Here the climber secures the right foot up onto what it seems to hold with a ledge. This one has a lot of surface so the climber is able to apply more surface onto the sole of the foot by the toe. In this one the climber keeps the knee out and pointing outwards to then come out of a squat that will be powerful to transfer the weight shifting the hips over to the right side and gaining leverage at the same time while pulling down on the hold as well as sustaining the next grip upright. It's important that the climber glances over to make the right foot placement, such as applying pressure on the toes, as they will generate a lot of power because they're coming from the leg. Now, on the first placement, the right foot was the one positioned first. And quickly after the climber had reached the top hold, while holding onto this grip, the climber is keeping extended.

So she's found a pretty decent position right hand on it's kind of her anchor left foot on deal knows how You know, she's still climbing pretty square feet are pretty bunched up and she's kind of being forced from the wall pretty severely Whereas if she could stick this right foot out a little further She could kind of twist into the wall a little bit and bring this knee forwards that way and she's standing on this hole She's standing straight down through it and then kind of pivot around that left arm to shoot her up up the wall So this is kind of what I mean about, you know, she, it seems that she knows the position but doesn't fully get into them. So she walks her feet through and while she's, you know, right hand on, super nice and straight but still engaged, left foot on. We'll see how far her hips are from the wall. So what I think she could do is kind of get a bit more staggered stance, kind of drop this left knee to the right, flag this right foot out, kind of really create tension, toe in to the wall right here. And then from there, when she makes the move up, she's going to be able to twist this knee in and extend and push through the legs to drive herself up the wall. But right now with her legs kind of being straight on, it seems to kind of just be driving her hips, her feet seem to be driving her body away from the wall while her upper body is trying to keep herself up the wall. So it's kind of this, these two angles of force are kind of like fighting each other almost. So they're done twisting in, that will kind of bring her body under these holds, which should make them easier to hold too. She was not able to hold that right foot swinging away from the wall working against her. That ultimately pulls her off the wall. So it looks like she's turning in a relatively good position. She's kind of bent armed. But it might just be that the hold is good and she's kind of just loading up to make the first move. So not a horrible starting position. Can't really see what her feet are doing. But she's got this relatively good hold and looks like she's engaging out pretty nicely and setting up to kind of make the next move in a powerful, quick fashion. So she seems to lose tension, so she's at the right height for the hold. She's got the hold in her hand. You'll notice this right leg kind of loses all tension and swings back from the wall. Which is going to bring her whole body kind of, you know, it's gravity is going to work against her and that force is going to kind of go through her entire body. So it starts with the foot and swings out. That's going to drive her leg from the wall, her hips from the wall, and then her upper body from the wall. So she's going to have to one fight to pull back in. When she's not able to do that, she's kind of ripped free from the wall. But makes that move pretty well. She extends to the feet. You'll see her, you know, she's not twisted in. She's climbing very square to the wall. Feet are kind of close together. She does hit this hold. Keeps it nice and straight. So now her arms are kind of nice and straight. So not a bad position to be in. So then she actually gets this first hole and it kind of looks like really fast movement. So maybe it makes me think that she could have sank in lower into that starting position and kind of twisted in and kind of like just kind of created more tension and drive their feet. It kind of looks like she got to pull herself to the hole and hit it.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Because there's this large hold in the way, and see how far their arm has to extend around it, that makes it actually a bit more difficult to catch this with a straight arm, putting them in a flexed position. So this requires higher finger strength to maintain. So if they're not good at holding this hold, if their fingers aren't strong enough to just hold on to this smaller hold, this is going to become a struggle position. So climbers moving with good body positioning and pace for these first two moves, twisting the hip in to be able to reach up and left with relatively straight arms. One challenge we see here though is that the judge is guiding them with a laser pointer. So there's a big difference between being able to memorize the sequence and climb through it and being guided through it. So it's kind of an inconsistency with the judge right here. The climbers who get the whole sequence lit up for them as they're climbing have an easier time on the wall than those that have to memorize it. So this is good. We see the climber follow the judge's laser pointer to show the sequence, but then they come back to the start of the route, get closer to the holds, and start pantomiming how they anticipate holding things with their hands. This visualization practice, running it a few times before starting, is really helpful in memorizing hold placement, but also in memorizing a sequence so that climbers can move more efficiently when they're on the wall. Good use of an open hip position here. We'll generally want to see the climber turn their hip into the wall. If the foothold is too high and it's the only foot available, climber can just keep the foot in and have the hip pointing out. What they want to do here is, as they pull in, the knee and hip extend over in this direction and it gets them closer to the target hold. So something we will generally see more advanced climbers do is in addition to sequencing out the hands, they're also paying attention to sequencing out foot positioning and where they're going to place feet for each move. Something we tend to see is that climbers memorize the hand sequence really well, but if they don't remember where foot holds are placed or memorize their foot sequence, they still end up spending extra time on the wall searching for them, and that draws a lot of energy.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

But something that's interesting within climbing is sometimes things are just in the way. In route setting we use big volumes to create an aspect of the wall that forces the climber to get around it. This is an inadvertent example of that where the climber is having to reach around this big orange tufa. And it's just kicking their hips out away from the wall in a way that the climber probably didn't anticipate. And they're currently just sort of barn dooring off the wall here. And after the climber gets up into this right hand, they step their left foot through to a foothold here and they're able to reach straight up into this down pulling hold here. Pretty good position for the climber, straight arms. Seems pretty relaxed looking up at where they wanna go. Okay, so we do have a change in the way they are showing the boulders to the climbers. Now they're using a laser pointer to show the climber the holds that are marked as on for this boulder. Maybe they ran out of sheets of paper or are making things up on the fly. I don't know, but this is a pretty common practice for spray walls to have somebody sitting back and point a laser pointer at different holds. Climber then goes up and right into this hold and they're able to get a pretty big foot here which they put their right foot on and they just switched to their left foot so that means that this right hand is probably going to be the primary hold. The right hand on this hold and the left foot here is going to allow the climber to flag this right foot out and hopefully release tension off of this left hand. So here we have this match start. It's a bit of a crowded match. When a hold is crowded, it just means it's hard to get both hands on there at one time. And their right foot is on the wall, down there.

The reason why is that there wasn't enough power or good management of the body when going for the reach. A couple notes here is that the right foot is the one that needs to create the most pressure while gaining leverage. Another thing is that the climber is trying to stay right underneath the hold by pointing the elbow out while sustaining the grip. This is not good as the grip can be good at the moment but for sustaining for the leverage and the way that the hold wants to be held the climber should have extended the leg first to apply posture to remain on the lean position to sustain the hold. And more like a dynamic move that will go out and up as a curve with the hips to stay the hip to stay the right side of the hip close to the wall. At the same time it's important that the climber keeps the leg flagged out to keep balance during that motion of the curb moving up to the next hold. Here as the climber has reached the top hold, the need to hold on to this hold to stay in place is by the climber remaining to the right side of that hold. Now while the foot goes over the other, being the right foot that was out on a flag, comes across the other leg and is placed on a higher foot placement. This so that the climber can be ready to then push away from the hold as the climber will need to keep pressure on to it. Here the climber starts by placing both hands on the same hold. This is a one start hold so when both hands are placed on the same hold this is called matching and the climber won't start until the feet are placed on the wall. Quickly, once the climber had secured the right foot, being the toe for the pressure to gain leverage on the next move, the climber had left the left foot off the wall and had transferred it to the left side. This one being extended, again being on a flag so that the climber can maintain balance and bring the center of gravity close to the wall, as the climber will need to remain the right side as close as possible when reaching for the next move. Here the climber is now leaning on the hold above. This one's sustaining the grips and leaning back so to apply the pressure on the hold. This time the climber has placed both of their feet up off the ground and this is where the climb will start. Right now the only foot that is being placed is the left foot while the right foot, the leg is extended and pointed out. This is for using for balance.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The arm is getting more and more bent It almost looks like they're attempting to do like a twist lock Technique, but you can see they're already moving their right hand up to the next hold So it seems like maybe they're just rushing the gun a little bit Ideally what I think would be better is for them to kind of fully twist Into this forearm and that's gonna bring their hip into the wall, too And then this left foot that is right now is kind of dangling out and away from the wall It doesn't look like super engaged kind of bringing that up keeping it straight haven't really smear into the wall Provide a little bit tension through the toes So overall it looks like they kind of come It seems like they know that the twist lock technique is maybe the technique but they don't fully commit to it Maybe they don't realize that they're not fully coming to it. But the move just looks rushed over Oz it seems like they're moving from one position to the next as fast as possible and Isn't taking time to set up and really Rotate into that arm and really get into a nice stable position before making the move So you can see the climbers starting off in a decent position. Their arms are straight. Kind of got the Sager stance with their lower body. You can see the climber looking up into the left. So the next hole is probably somewhere in this area. I think the only thing they could do a little better is it looks like maybe their knee is facing outwards. So they could turn that knee to the right and kind of get their whole left hip into the wall. And that way they could really push with this tension foot and kind of really pivot around this entire movement to get this next side pull. Whereas kind of staying square to the wall might have them taking more of the movement to their arms instead of their lower body. So you can see they're about to fall off and the left arm is getting more and more engaged. The foot doesn't seem to be really pushing through and now this left foot's already kind of coming away from the wall, which is causing the whole body to kind of rotate out, which is going to cause them to have to pull in with their left hand even more. So we can see the climber makes the first move. Immediately once it's that first hold, they're keeping their arm nice and straight, so they're not fighting the position yet.

So we see a climber beginning the attempt by gazing at the problem and also feeling out the start hold. What I want to see them is kind of also sequencing the problem and pantomiming the movement they anticipate doing. I want to do this from the ground. Easier it tends to be when they're climbing on the wall. So you see the climber commits to really twisting and more right, but they don't extend at all. So they just twist and reach towards the hold, which puts them too short and they're too twisted to the left to really recover from that position. They kind of send themselves off the wall.

Now for the first move, the climber is placed down low, applying enough pressure with the hands above and keeping more pressure by keeping the arms extended. Also, this is called the rest position, which the climber will be able to then glance over and apply the most pressure on the hands while bringing the feet up in position. Once the feet are off the ground, then the climb starts. Here the climber is chalking off their hands and the chalk is going to act as to gain more grip when on the wall. So it also absorbs any sweat that may be coming from the hands. Here the climber went into a slight pull up to move up to the next hold. Once the climber had placed the second move onto the first hold, then the climber is able to apply enough pressure on the hand or in the grips so that they can release some pressure on the feet to release one foot at a time into placement. In this case the right foot was down in place when making that first move and the left leg is coming over and across to make apply the foot on a higher stance.

So rotate that left hip into the wall, really flag this right foot out, smear into the wall, create tension, really twist that upper body into her bicep and forearm.

But if we look on the left side, it looks like your feet and we can't see her left foot But the arm isn't hiding too much means to the edge of the wall kind of run right here So it looks like the feet are pretty bunched up and you can see that With this like kind of bunching her knee is kind of up against the wall But then her upper leg kind of drives her straight back from the wall and that I think that explains why her hips are so far back from the wall So I think in this case having more staggered wide stance Try to make that foundation as wide and stable as possible So maybe this right foot sticks out and kind of smears against the wall unless they're kind of twisting Or maybe the left foot flags or something like that It's doing something to keep this kind of stance wider because when the feet kind of get bunched It's just gonna force that wall It's kind of gonna be pushing you out from the wall as you're trying to kind of go into the wall So they're kind of yet kind of opposing What you want to do? And we can see that's what happens. She takes her left hand off and she's pulling with her right arm, loses the tension on her feet, and the feet just pop off the wall. And from this we can kind of see her left leg kick up over here Which is why I think she kind of hits this move off balance And that's why she's kind of engaged throughout it so you can kind of see the arms are nice and engaged And bent so it's not the most ideal ideal position Especially from the start when we know we can start from such a good straight arm position for the most part Be nicer to see her drive through the feet and kind of pivot up to this hold", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So small detail we see as climbers beginning this attempt, they chalk up their hands, but they're using very minimal chalk. We're gonna see like only on these fingertips is it really chalked up. This hand, left hand looks relatively clean and the palms look relatively clean. All the holes in their problem are pretty big. They go about this far down on the hand. So we expect the climber to really chalk up a lot. Chalk is something they can use excessively, but ideally there's a full layer of chalk between their skin and the actual holes they're grabbing. Clamor is able to establish on the problem and makes the first move pretty quickly. They're good about just carrying the momentum right now through into the next move.

And so the climber was able to get into this right hand and as they were putting weight through this left foot, attempting to reach up and grab this left hand, it just slipped. A lot of times on later attempts, a climber will, the way that I always say it is they'll lose respect for a portion of the boulder and stop thinking about it, stop having as clear of an intention for the easier moves on a boulder problem and this is a good example of that.

In this case before the climber was able to reach the right hand up to the next move the left foot has popped out of his place. Now the climber could have sustained this move if instead has transferred the weight over to the right side meaning the hips to be shift over where the right foot placement is as this is more secured and there is more edge for the toe box. The climber would have to brought their hips closer to the wall in order to stand into the highest foot but instead I have relied on the lower foot which is the one that has popped off before the climber made the move. Here the climber moves quickly with the right hand up to the next hold. And going up to the right hold, the climber had pressed pressure with the right foot, going diagonally up. Now the foot that was in flag was the left foot, which now is crossing over to then be applied for a high foot placement for the next move. The climber starts here by chocking up the hands and is covering the entire surface of the hand. The chock will help the climber to gain a better grip on the wall and also absorbing any sweat that may be coming from the hands. The climber has lost its sense of gravity because of the foot being popped off the wall. Each limb sustaining at 100% total in order to the climber to free up the next limb on the movement. Climbers should keep most of the time three points of contact if not two. Or would say to have the grip or pull or pressure divided between the limbs. In this case the climber was relying on the foot that was popped off at a certain percentage. And once that percentage is lost, it's really hard for the other two limbs on the wall to compensate for that power. Here the climber has gained leverage by standing on the left foot and keeping the right leg extended. This is called flagging out. The climber in order to twist the hips over left side, the climber has tapped against the wall with the right toe. And quickly also aiding it for the reach by twisting the upper body to remain the left side close to the wall. Here the climber is getting placed low on holding to the start hold. Since it's a one start hold, the climber is placing both hands on the same hold, which is called matching. Now, as the climber must apply the most pressure on the grips in order to bring the feet up from the ground onto the wall.

She could maybe balance out. But it looks like her left foot wasn't really tensioned and her weight wasn't fully over her right foot, which both played a role of her kind of falling off the wall. I like that she starts to kind of twist more. As she makes this move, it looks like in this move, she keeps really good tension. She could probably twist a little bit more into that arm and twist her hips in a little bit more. But this right foot looks like it's maintaining nice good tension. It's not dangling and cutting free, causing her body to kind of slip away from the wall. She's looking very nice and rigid on this movement. Like she's keeping a lot of tension. You can see she kind of hits this move perfectly. Perfect height. Her body just looks nice and straight and rigid. So you can see she's starting nice straight arms again. I can't really see what the feet are doing, but they kind of look like they're all centered in this area. Her hips are kind of far back from the wall, so it looks like she's almost, maybe a little bit too bunched up with the feet. For this next move, she kind of gets this high right foot, so she is opposite posed. But it looks like she's maybe prematurely moving the right hand, so if I was her, I would want her to kind of shift this knee so she's kind of toning down straight through this hold and just shift her weight more over because she kind of, it's like she kind of lets go this right hand a little bit prematurely and it just caused her to lose all tension, just fall off the wall. She makes this first move, kind of hits it locked off and straightens it out. And he immediately goes down and looks to move her feet around.

Climbers left hand reaches up and as soon as it's established, the right foot comes up to this hold. This is kind of a hip out position. They're reaching towards this target hold that's let up. Rather than twisting the right hip in, they can just extend their knee over the foot to pull up with that leg and get themselves closer to the target hold. It may be possible for them to also flag the left foot underneath if they need more stability here. So we see climber begin the attempt after a long period of rest time on the ground. Generally in this kind of timing for comp format where they only have four minutes it's very easy to get fatigued giving multiple attempts so the more time they spend resting between each try it's a good chance to recover between attempts. Climber pulls on the wall relatively smoothly. They twist right hip in to be able to reach up with right hand. This hip position allows them to reach with a straighter arm and use less force. Climber walks their feet through relatively smoothly so the left foot is placed on the right side.

This is a pretty classic body position in climbing.

Here we have a good look at this start hold here. Not quite as crowded as I had thought it was. Looks like a pretty decent hold. You can see this is a worthy start hold. So the climber looks like they just got a little confused as to where they were trying to go. They were supposed to go into this hold as they initiated that lock off position. It looks like they got a little ahead of themselves. They were looking around and the last minute saw the target hold and just fell off the boulder. So the climber was able to surf up and right into this good hold here. And now you can see their right foot or left foot, sorry, is on the wall. They've dropped their right foot out. And they're kind of in balance. So this right leg or left foot, sorry, is pulling these hips and pulling against that foot jib and pulling the hips into the wall this direction. And the right arm is straight and allowing that pendulum to keep moving in towards the wall with the opposition of the foot. And they're looking up the wall towards that next handhold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

We can tell because the climber was able to move quickly to place the left hand behind the hold. What the climber lacked here and for the slippage was that the climber lost surface of the grip with the right hand. As seen in the image the climber is slipping off or had slipped off the hold. Now potentially this could have been avoided if the climber had pressed pressure with the right toe against the wall on a flag so that the climber didn't have to swing so much dynamically to the right side and instead try to keep themselves over slightly to the left or under the hold to avoid the slippage. Here the climber has performed a bump so that means that they first went to the hold down below and quickly moved up to the following hold. This move is called bumping and what it does is the climbers is still remaining most pressure on the right foot. This one this time to go for the next throw the climber was extending the leg so that they can create power for the following one. Still the left leg was extended and is instead used as for balance as the climber makes the reach. Once the climber gets a solid grip on the hold above with both hands and the climber is able to release pressure from the feet in order to move them up, which is what the climber is doing right now. Again, the right hand then is placed as an undercling but it seems to be sliding more than usual, meaning that has a positive pinch because the climber is engaging the thumb, having a full grip with the entire surface of the hand. Again, the climber needs to be leaned back on the hold as the top hand is placed as an open grip and pressure needs to be applied while the climber leans on the hold. As we can see the climber when quickly was moving the left hand over to match the same hold that the right hand was on, the climber's hand has to slip off the hold. This one probably was just enough fingers that, finger grip that was lacking on sustaining the climber from slipping out the hold. The foot is still in place, meaning that this was a foothold that was placed correctly and with enough pressure in the moment that the climber got to grip the hold. However, the right hand slipped off and the need of potentially the climber could have sustained this move if they were able to not lean so much onto the right side this one so that the hand didn't slip out. Here the climber had cut feet meaning that both feet were off the wall and now it's coming back into the wall. This time the climber takes advantage of the swing and brings the footwork to be at a higher placement. Now the right toe was the one that was in place first so since it's a small foot chip that the climber is trying to stand on they do a toe they're doing a toe out while the other toe comes into place. So this one the climber will do by stacking the left foot on top of the right foot and carefully apply more pressure on the grips and the instance of the climber will then smear carefully by pointing the toe into the wall and quickly take placement where the right toe is. Here the climber starts at a one start hold with both hands placed on the same hold. This is called matching and both hands right now are facing up. When the facing up placement is called an undercling and the climber must keep the elbows close to the core. This is so that the climber is able to engage on the pull as the climber would also need to pull away while being on the undercling and places the feet up onto position. Once the feet are off the ground then the climb will start. Here the climber gets to reach the top hold and on this instance because of the power dynamic to sustain the hold, this one being a positive one, the climber needs to create a lot of pressure from the top one and due to the extension the climber lets go of the feet. Letting go of the feet of the wall, this is called cutting feet and where the climber will then try to remain steady to then quickly move their foot positioning to the next hold that will be ideal for the next move. Here the climber was able to sustain the next move going upright. Now for the climber to get the full extension to secure the throw, the climber then has only stepped on the right foot and has to bend while pulling themselves on a pull up to go out for the throw outright. The left leg being extended, this is called flagging out, which can make the climber feel balanced when going for the throw and not crunched up. The toe also is pressed against the wall so that the climber can bring their hips close to the wall, the right side, to gain more extension when on the throw. Here the climber reaches the extension for the next hold and it does this by keeping the undercling, pulling themselves into the first hold and reaching out with the left hand above it. We can see how the hand above has an open grip where the climber slides the fingers behind the hold and then open hand. Open hands usually will need to keep pressure by the climber still leaning on down on it and is pressing down on the feet so that they can gain leverage.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So now she does this move up to this big kind of juggy pinch thing. You'll see her legs are quite bent, so she actually ends up cutting feet here. So here what I think is, if she wasn't more locked off on this arm, she could kind of push and kind of do a coordinated push with her foot and stand up into this, because from there to there, the foot is still, she's just barely off of it and her legs are still bent. So she could drive a little bit more, so it seems like kind of a sign that maybe she's not driving through the feet as well, and more pulling with her upper body, and that's going to cause her to lose attention and cut free from the wall. I'm just going to make her have to reset, and also make her take all of her body weight to her upper body. I like this position. So the main anchor point is this left hand. The right hand is kind of assisting with this undercling. And then they're sticking this left foot out, kind of flagging it. It looks like maybe it could be a little bit more rigid or keep a little bit more tension by towing into the wall and smearing hard. But then they're kind of doing this opposite of pose where it's got the right foot's loaded, left hand's loaded. So I think out of this, all I'd like to see is maybe twisting into the wall a little bit more, really bring that weight under that hold so they're not having to kind of pull in and up. But they got a little bit closer. They should be able to spring up off that right foot and kind of just pivot totally around this foot and hit this next hold right here. So she does end up getting the left foot on, so she is right hand, left foot. But the only thing that we'll notice here is that she's facing the hold. So she's having to pull herself in, and this is an undercling. So that means she wants to be, let me draw this out, she wants to be as perpendicular to that. So she wants her body weight on the right side of this line. So she can oppose and kind of undercling it. But by facing it, so now she's got this, and she's in a position to hold this position really well. But now she's going to want to get her right foot on, and really pivot around this hold, and have her body be on this side. So that way when she holds this, she's opposing it. Because the positive angle, the positive angle is to hold this down and to the left. So she wants to be up and to the right to maximize her position. But she seems to kind of second-guess it and so she's now bringing her right foot back to the left So this is gonna be kind of a little bit awkward She's gonna be right hand on right foot on but if it was out left She could bring the left foot out and kind of backflick bounce out Now with her body being right right hand right foot but right foot to the left It's gonna kind of create this awkward tension on her body want to kind of barn door out And it's gonna keep have her keep a lot more tension So maybe the ideal thing would be get her foot back on instead of heel That's probably what I would recommend is she's got this huge left hand so she could just Kind of balance the right foot there stick the left foot on heel hook right away and take all that weight And that would kind of let her lean back to them and gain this match on this hold So here we can see the climber starting this kind of undercling position on this purple hold. And so depending on which hand they're moving up with, I believe it is the left hand to this hold right here. You know it seems like their knees are kind of driving them out from the wall. So it's kind of like their knees and their shins are close to the wall and their thighs kind of stick perpendicular out from the wall. So it's kind of forcing their hips back from the wall. So this is where it might be advantageous to kind of try to twist in, depending where the feet are and the body's kind of blocking the left leg. So I can't see that as well. But it seems like something could be kind of maybe a little bit less square, a little bit more twisting in to really maximize and utilize the tension in their body. Instead I feel like this is they're going to have to kind of push and pull and it's going to be working against each other. The legs are kind of pushing out while the arms are going to try to pull in. That's going to be kind of at odds with the movement. She does do a good job of kind of giving the legs kind of scrunch so there's not as much. The left foot is still swinging out pretty far so that's going to be a little bit rough. But she does kind of a good job of turning the foot cut and kind of transferring that momentum to the right to get the foot back on. So she is being speedy about it. So you can see here, they don't really extend too much and it kind of bends the arm a little bit. Kind of just very subtly, but it kind of makes me think that the lower body maybe isn't doing as much work. And they're maybe relying more on their upper body, kind of pulling and twisting with their chest and shoulders. They're not really driving with the feet. It's like a small but subtle thing. You can kind of notice in their right foot that the right foot's keeping tension, but not like... It seems like all it's doing is keeping tension, but not driving. Here you can see them make the first move and immediately they get this kind of nice relaxed position Looking down at the feet kind of moving the feet around it kind of looks like they're already giving up the grip on the Right hand a little bit. This might be a little bit premature But overall like going into this movement looks good", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They swing around hanging looking for it and that's fatiguing. So when they finally do find and start reaching left hand to hit the undercling side of this hold which is quite positive, their right hand slips and they're not in a position where they can really recover either hand now. Good reach to the yellow hold, stepping the right foot up and turning the hip in allows them to reach back with the right hand and they have to still move with a little bit of speed but you can see from this position they don't really have to do much in terms of extending their leg to be able to reach the right hand hold. So we see the climber begin the attempt by following the judge's laser pointer and gazing at the whole problem. We don't really see them do much in terms of sequencing or pantomiming what they intend to do on the ground, or while it's possible they may be sequencing in their head, we do usually want to see someone physically miming out that sequence, because it gives a good idea of the distance between each hold and position, and allows them to climb more efficiently on the wall. Good pace and commitment for them to catch this move. They don't really hesitate much from that extended position to be able to jump and catch the better pinch. There's a good thumb catch on this if they wrap their hand around the entire hold, if their hand's big enough, that's a more stable position. However, they're also in a pretty good spot on this jug that they can allow themselves to just swing the right foot back over to the right side, and they'll be in a good position with this hold. Good first move off this double undercling position. This hold here is really positive and deep on the bottom side. That kind of hand position with the palm facing up works best when the hips are getting elevated. So when they're hanging below the hold, it's harder, but as they sit up and reach, this becomes more and more of a stable position. So the position they're here between both hands, one undercling and one on the jug is a really stable spot.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And they're in a back step position and their right hip is into the wall. Right foot is perched on this good foothold. Left leg is flagged out. This counterbalances the right movement the climber is doing. So here we have this undercling start here on this big nose, and you can see the climbers palms are up, their biceps are also facing up, they're essentially doing a bicep curl on this hold. They have both feet on the wall, and they're in this square position looking up at the hold that they are about to go to. Here you have the climber come in and try an undercling match on this pinch, but the swing was too much as they released the left hand which was down here. It made the hips swing around and they just weren't able to maintain tension or maintain that grip. And so their hands are just kind of blown off the hold. And then from there the climber does a big pounce out jump to this good pinch here and they've lost tension through their feet but that's okay because they're on two very good holds so they should be able to control this swing.

Needing to make a new foot placement for the reach, as the climber was moving out the right foot, the foot has dropped. There was so much force incorporated on keeping the hip against the wall that the climber was probably too weak to make the next move. Here we can see the climber how quickly had moved the right hand over to join and match the left hand. Both hands and the same hold is called matching. And quickly had brought the leg that was on a flag up to a high wrist stance. Here the climber gets to the right hand up to a hold that looks like a jug meaning that the fingers is able to curl behind it and keep a closed grip. Since the climber has a solid grip is able to lean back and rely on that hold going on the opposite direction as the hold is facing sideways. Now for the climber to remain this quickly had moved the right foot at a higher stance and the left foot has gone over to the right side pointing out. When the leg is extended and folded behind this is a back flag which the climber is using so that they can keep their center of gravity close to the area of support. The center of gravity comes from the hips of the climber and brings it as close as they can so that this can help the climber not peel off the wall sideways. Here we can see the climber trying to go for the reach. In this case, the climber is doing everything that they can with keeping the entire left side against the wall. Now the climber, we can see how they're even arching to make the most reach out of it while still pulling on the grid. Since the climber is not able to sustain this reach, has to rethink on foot positioning. It's good that the climber brings the hips towards the wall. This one because the feet can be reliable for sustaining most of the climber's weight. As the grip eventually could get tired if the climber's hips are just out away from the wall, creating more pressure for the grips, which can tire the climber out. Here the climbers are starting at a sit start. Sit starts are usually difficult to come off from since the climber will have to pull all of their weight from being started, sitting down on the mat, and onto the wall. Once the climber has pulled off their weight and is remaining solely on the grips and on the foot chips, then the climber starts. It's important the climber, even though they are matching the same hold, because it's sideways, meaning that the entry for the hand grip is over on slightly onto the right side of the hold, the climber must apply pressure by pressing down on the feet and leaning on the opposite direction, meaning slightly off to the left side to keep the pressure on. As the climber keeps the arms extended, this is called the rest position and is able to scan down for what the next footwork or hand placement would be. Here the climber quickly had moved the left hand from its original position to go up and match the same hold where the right hand is and quickly moved on to the top hold. This one the climber is trying to keep the body fully twisted to have the left side completely on the wall. This the climber does by keeping that left foot onto the right side flagged out and the climber as they're flagging out and gaining distance is coming off from the wall out and this is to then embrace the twist for the reach. Here the climber comes off the first position, which is at a great distance. So since the climber needed to reach that distance, the climber mostly had to play the most pressure from the feet and bring the hips as close as she can towards the wall by raising them up and towards the wall while creating a pull-in position by keeping the elbow close to the core. For then gain reach, throwing the hip outright to this then gain leverage on the right side. To locate the right hand above.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

She doesn't really utilize her arm or her feet. It's kind of, she kind of like lurches for it. You can kind of see your body kind of come out away from the wall. So it looks like she's maybe, she's keeping good tension on her feet and she's bouncing. She still has this back leg. She doesn't really drive up the wall to get to this hold. She kind of just moves her arm and kind of twist in. And it looks like it was made at the end of her reach. So she wasn't able to really control it. Now here we can see she's utilizing a back flag. So she's got her right hand on, she's nice and straight. Her left arm is still on below, keeping tension. But right now she's mainly on right hand, right foot. So this left foot is kind of coming behind her. You can see it's nice and straight and rigid. Toe is kind of pressing into the wall, so that's gonna provide a third balance point. And really stabilize her on the wall and prevent her from barn dooring off. Because now it's almost like her right foot is her left foot. It's because now her left foot is so far to the right. So she's got this nice stable platform to kind of drive from. So now we can see she's twisting in to try to reach out left. It's right at the end of her reach and so she's still waiting this bottom right foot and the left foot is kind of creating tension. So she really is effectively right hand on, right foot on with the left foot providing a little balance where she kind of needs to get on top of this left foot and drive up and over because even if she hits this, she's going to be fully extended, you know, fingertips to toe tips on these two points right here. So this is just kind of a case of getting too stretched out and not committing to the higher move and getting scrunched. So here we can see she's starting from a pretty good position. Her arms are nice and straight. She's kind of dropping back into her feet, looking up in the direction of where she's going to. So her eyes are moving to where she'll be moving her hands. Her feet aren't too scrunched, but they're not too close. They're kind of in a nice position to really drive up the wall. Now we can see she's kind of got this higher left foot. Kind of hit a minor body in her right foot. It's down here to the right. She's matched on this hold. Again, arms are nice and straight. But she's trying to attempt to kind of reach out left to one of these holds. And it's just out of reach. So she needs to kind of perch on top of this left foot and transfer weight away from this bottom foot. Which should be fine, because she's got her right hand on and she'll have her left foot and then be able to reach her left hand out to that hold to grab it. This is going to kind of let her save a little energy instead of having to transfer her weight to her feet and switch feet. She can kind of do this back leg and then just keep all of her weight on the right foot and it's going to save her up foot movement, which will potentially save her a little bit of energy. And here we can see she kind of twists in, and she reaches up and gets her right hand on this hole, and she kind of maintains a nice straight arm, really driving through the feet, so she's got a lot of tension here. And kind of this twisting in is gonna kind of allow her to not to pull in with her arm, but she can kind of lock her arm off and kind of brace her chest against her forearm and bicep to kind of utilize the strength in that position. It's kind of a twist lock technique.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

They're already in kind of an extended position. You can see by the head kind of tilting back as they reach this hold. Because it's such a large jug, this is okay. They can be a little inefficient here and still recover the climb. And we can see by how much the climber is re-gripping that they're very hesitant about their ability to use this hold. All of those little re-grips, every time they're flexing and repositioning on the hold, draw a lot of energy. It makes it more difficult to maintain and use the next hold. So, the way the climber does this move is definitely less efficient, but if they don't have the finger strength to pull through, this may be the best beta for them. Their right foot is posted high, allowing them to flag left foot behind the right leg as a counterbalance. Ideally, the climber would just pull straight through to this hold. However, because they don't have the pull strength, they stop and match here first and make it into two smaller moves. It's definitely a usable tactic if the climber doesn't have the strength to pull through. However, it also adds an additional move, making it more tiring overall.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

That means that they shoot their arm out, but their hips are still way too far to the right here. They should shift over with the arm. And this is just a technical error from the climber. My guess is that they're really comfortable in this right hand, and they're unwilling to release it from that position to be more square in this position over here to the left. And so the climber falls as a result. So after a quick match on this hold, the climber maintains the body position, is able to go up and left into this hold. You'll notice this kind of extreme back flag. That's allowing the climber to put most of their weight into this right arm while maintaining the right foot that's on the wall and find a balance point there. So here we have a dual start hand position. They also have two feet on the wall, so they're completely square, which means that both of these arms are equally loaded, which is cool because as soon as the climber releases one of these hands, it's going to speed up the momentum of the body coming away from the wall and they're going to have to smash into whatever hold they're going to. So it should be pretty powerful and kind of an extreme move to get out of. Bye. So here you have the climber camping out on this hold and I think it's worth noting whoever's running the laser pointer is shooting the laser between this hold and I Think this hold down here Or I know it's this hold that they're pointing back and forth to I think it's really confusing the climber Not knowing which hold they're supposed to go to because the lasers shifting back and forth So sometimes there's external things that can confuse the climber and I think this is a good example of that The climber is able to get up and right into this hold. And you can see the laser pointer is right here, so I imagine that's where the climber is going to put their foot.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

And this one does it to powerfully twisting their left side towards the wall to gain the reach and facing out. So facing away from actually looking at the hold can help the climber gain distance, but the climber wasn't able to pull forcefully against the wall to gain that reach and able to hang on or grip the hold above. The climber then had done a quick readjustment with the right hand to then create sufficient friction on pressure. Since the hold is open to the right side, the climber must lean on the opposite direction. Now, since the climber is creating the most pressure on the higher hold, being the grip held above and also creating power to keep themselves close to the wall with the left hand is able to then release some pressure from the feet to work their feet up at a higher stance. This one being the right foot at a high, bringing it at a high foot stance. Here the climbers performing at a sit start, meaning that the climber before going up to the next moves must raise their hips off the mat, which adds to the grade. As we can see there is also a two hand hold start and the feet are placed down below. The climber must press down on the feet to raise the hips and pull themselves in with their grips before starting any move. We can see how the climber then quickly has also moved the left foot to fold behind the right leg. In this one, the left foot that is aiming out to the right side is called flagging out or back flagging since it's folded behind the right foot. This is so that the climber can keep the entire left side facing the wall and to keep the hips, which is the center of gravity of the climber, to stay close to the wall so that the climber is able to then pull up and bring the center of gravity as close to the base of support while the climber gains reach for the next hold. Here the climber has done the next move which is at a great reach coming from the start hold. The climber then had to press down on the feet and bring the hips as close as they can to the wall to then gain reach in order to sustain the hold above.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

So actually she's hit this right hand hold. She kind of gains control of it, kind of gets into a more powerful position, engage to the arms and the shoulders, but she has right foot on, right hand on. So most of her weight's on the left side of this line, which is gonna set her up for a barn door to kind of mitigate this. She's gonna stick this left foot out into the right, and it looks like it's pretty straight and rigid, the toe driving into the wall. So this is a really good position when you can't switch your feet, and you can't get opposite opposed. Or if you just wanna save yourself from doing a foot movement, or depending on the orientation of the foothold, if there's a bunch of challenges that make swapping your feet a little harder, this can be a really good move so that you don't have to foot swap. So here we can see she's starting from a pretty nice stance, straight arms. Not really fighting the position, not kind of pulling in, really leaning back and getting her feet to drive into the wall. And then looking up at her next hold and kind of eyeing down where she needs to go. So overall, pretty good starting position. It's hard to know what kind of goes wrong here, but you can see she's reaching up at this left hand Seems like about all of her tension kind of gives out her arm is kind of It's kind of bent So I think something that could fix this would be kind of Turning her torso into that arm that bicep and forearm and really twisting and locking in And kind of bracing us bracing your chest against the forearm and bicep That or maybe driving up with the foot Or swapping feet and playing out. Maybe that would let her twist in deeper But are the case that she was just not able to hold attention as she's Lost all the tension is falling off the wall We can see as she kind of drives up I Think she's like not maybe driving up far enough because you see if she hits this hold But her whole body when she hits this right hand hold her whole body kind of stretches backwards Like she hits it and then like there's just no tension through her body And so she's kind of got tension on her toes tension on her fingertips, but everything in between Seems like it's not Tense and providing like It's not really aiding her in her upward movement So it's like when she hits this it's like her whole body just relax and kind of pulls away from the wall And maybe it's just that She's not tensing her core up. That's probably that's probably what it is or she's maybe not twisting in enough Towing her enough at some point in some point from her fingertips to her toe tips There seems to be something that's kind of letting loose in the chain and causing her to kind of fall away from the wall", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

It would have been better for them to move more dynamically. As a result, they're getting just barely to the hold with fingertips and they're not going to maintain this position. Climber makes this first move by twisting the right hip in and reaching up and right. Because it's so distant for them, we see their head kind of falls back away from the wall while they're moving. This isn't terribly inefficient because the handhold is so large they can wrap their entire hand around it. However, this is definitely not the ideal position to be able to make that move. So we see this attempt begins by the climber laying below the problem gazing up at it. There's a limited time left in their window. We can hear the judge announcing the next climber to prepare themselves. Climber right now is trying to recover as much as possible in their forearms and fingers to maintain energy to attempt the climb. So if there's limited time left, there's no point to making multiple attempts. Climber really wants to rest up so they have one solid attempt before their time is completed. climber is able to bring right foot up and left foot comes into a far outside flag as a counterbalance. If the climber is tired they can bring their left hand in here to match and then generate force to try to make the next move. So climber pulls on something we generally want to see is before an attempt them chalking up and their hands both look relatively clean Especially on holds like the ones on this climb which are using a lot of the hand itself Not just the fingertips the more chalk the better is that additional friction between the finger and the hold makes it easier to stay on Makes it easier to move", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

Now the climber needs to get onto a squat or crunched up position, leaning on the hand above. It gives us a positive grip, meaning it's a jug or a bucket. It's a closed grip so the climber could hold on for quite some time. And having the arm extended is called the rest position. Now in order for the climber to get to the next hold, we'll need to have a stance with the right foot, creating sufficient pressure to then gain leverage. With the foot being out on the left leg, this position is called flagging out. The climber will use this to keep balance and also help support keeping the right side of the climber towards the wall. Here we can see the climber moving up to the next hold. Both holds are the same hold, just pointing or set at separate directions. When the grip is hold onto the outside, the climber must remain leaning over to create pressure. In this case, for the higher hold, the climber must be pulled down and also lean back in the opposite direction. Since right now the climber is holding onto both holds, one below and one above, it creates stability for the climber, where now the climber can keep the arm extended and rest on the hold above. This, once the climber places both hands and is stable, can then release pressure from the feet to work your feet up. Seeing the climbers hands going into the pouch that's attached to the back of the climber is actually chalk. The chalk can help with the climbers performance to have a better grip when on the wall. Clamber lacked power generated by the right leg, reason why the clamber came off. As seen, the climber holds on to the grips tightly to then swing over by moving the hips facing onto the left direction. This one so that the climber can bring their feet in front of them and at a higher stance for the right toe. Once the toe is placed on the foot chip, then the climber can get positioned for what the next move would be.

So she doesn't sit in it too long before trying to move out of it. So she maybe thinks that, especially since she's moving over here to this left-handed hold, her body's so far to the right, that seems like she's in this position that she might want to walk her lower body more to the left. So that way when she comes to this kind of undercling hold, she's in a better position because right now, with how this hold is positioned, she wants to be as perpendicular. So she wants to be as far up and to the left as possible, which in this position she's as far down to the right as possible. And to start this move, she's probably going to want to get as far left as possible to grab the hold. And then from there, she'll probably start moving up and left, just to oppose that hold better. And it's hard to tell, not knowing what the next hold in the sequence is. So you can see, yeah, so she, when she grabs this kind of left, left hold, this undercling, but she grabs it with her right hand, her body's still so far to the right, and so the positive edge is up here. You know, she's going to want to be as far left as far and as much upwards on this hold as possible, so she's still grabbing this hold when she's down to the right.

Even though they opt away from it, that's still a good strategy to practice is identifying maybe that their beta is wrong and feeling out if there's a better way to start the problem. Climber establishes on the wall and tries to cross right hand through to the left hand undercling or left side undercling. This is definitely a doable move, but it requires that this left foot twists hip down. So the same kind of hip movement that we generally see if done as a full drop knee until the knee is facing down puts them in a very static position here and would allow that right hand to move confidently. Right now because the left hip is still facing out and the knee is facing out, they don't feel like they can stabilize on here at all and they run away from it.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

So here the climber tries to cross under into this jug. The way to get out of this would be to drive really hard with the right foot, drop this knee in, and pull the right knee out, and shift the hips to the left into the wall.

Now in this instance the climber will need to extend the left hand for the next move and since the center of support is the right side being the right hand and the right foot, the climber is folding the leg going out right and this is to avoid doing it bar and door like peeling off to the right side. So there's a reason why that the foot is folded over and extended so that it can help generate power to twist the hip left side towards the wall and this is to keep the center of gravity close to the area of support. Here the climbers are starting at a sit start. Sit starts are difficult to come from and would add to the grade as it makes it more difficult to start the climb. The climber must place their hands up onto the grips and feet down below in order to bring their hips up to a rise against the wall. Once the hips are lift up from the mat then the climb will start. Here the climber failed to reach up to the top hold. The reason why was the climber needed to have that arm extended being the right hand that was on a positive hold and to lean back as far as they can to then commit for a powerful move where they needed to do a hard pull doing a pull up and pressing down on the right foot pretty hard while pressing the toe against the wall. This with more force could have helped the climber reach the hold at a greater distance. Here the climber does a sustained reach which is done dynamically. The climber goes really low hanging on to the grips below where it was the start move and has engaged a power stance to reach up to the top hold. It's important that the climber keeps the hips against the wall to gain the most reach for the leverage.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

So here you can see she's starting in a pretty good position, arms are nice and wide on these starting holes, her feet are staggered so she can really drive through them, she's not really fighting the position and her arms are pretty straight. And she isn't able to hold this move. I think what she could have done in this case is kind of maybe, maybe the back flake isn't the best move to get this left hand high. And she could kind of utilize a twist lock because right now she is kind of twisting into this, but I think this might be where, might have been better for her to sit her left foot here, flake right foot out, and then kind of bring her chest and torso into that arm and forearm, and really twist and roll into her body against her arm, and kind of really twist and get that left hip into the wall because you can kind of see her left hip is kind of, it is closed, but it's kind of falling out, and it's kind of pulling her from the wall just a little bit. You can see she does drive to the feet as she hits this high right hand. And again, it's kind of keeping her arm nice and straight, not fighting the position too much. So overall, it looks like a good way to start. She does kind of recoil on the hold a little bit as she hits it, which makes me think that maybe she doesn't have as much tension.

And it's just a fully square position that the climber is in. So there isn't any one part that's taking more or less of the weight of the climber. It's pretty equally distributed, which is an interesting position because as the climber releases one of those appendages, it's going to create momentum and it's going to force the climber to utilize a lot of power to reach the next hold.

Here the climbers is starting at a one hold start with both hands on the same hold. This is called matching when both limbs are in one hold. Now the climber has placed their feet at a wide stance and it tells me that the climber overglancing to the left side means that we'll have to rely on the left foot by pressing down and making a move that would be dynamic to draw out left. Here we can see the climber dangling left to right. This is so the climber can generate some power to take advantage of the move when going out left and that way the climber doesn't have to use too much power moving just the left hand.

So ideally, she should be kind of pulling herself up, then down, instead of straight left and right, kind of pulling up at an angle. So that way, she can pull her weight over that foot, and bring this knee to the left so that she can pull straight down through it and push herself up to make this movement, instead of going back and forth.

So we see a climber begin the attempt by doing a quick gaze over the problem. Generally we would want to see them also pantomiming their potential sequence from the ground. The more the climber does this and visualizes what they anticipate doing on the wall, the more efficient they tend to climb because there's no time spent searching for holds as they climb. So, climber pulls on the starting hold and begins immediately developing this pendulum motion going right to left with their hips, anticipating a large dynamic movement. So there's two things going on here. One, this large dynamic movement is not necessary. There's this other handhold here that allows them to make this move pretty statically and controlled. It is definitely a skippable move. It is possible for them to go directly past this to the target hold.

At this instance, the left foot has lost placement and no longer is on the wall which would then bring the climber off the wall due to not being able to sustain gravity due to the pinch just being held recently with the right hand. The hand placement is probably still looking for its grip and missing the foot can drive the climber's center of gravity off the wall. Here the climbers is starting at a one-hole start where both hands must be placed on the first hold. When both hands are in the same hole this is called matching. Then the climber gets off the mat and places their feet on the wall. She is right now positioned at a wide stance and the reason why is because the foot out left is the one that she will be using on her way to the route as she glances over to the left side. Here the climber makes the first move sending the left hand over to the left side. The hold, the way that is held is an undercling which means that the palm would be facing up towards the hold and it slides the fingers underneath the hold behind the lip.

So she gets on the wall and she keeps her arms pretty straight, but she does slightly engage and pull in a little bit, which makes me think that maybe she's not super comfortable on her feet. So ideally, we kind of get these arms straight and she'd kind of relax and really drive these hips and legs down into the wall, onto the foot chips to really maximize her tension power and make sure that from the very first moment she's on the wall, she is pulling through her lower body. So I like what she's doing here, she's kind of eyeing up these two holds and what her span is. So she's kind of eyeing this left hold and the start hold. This kind of gauge how much power she's going to have to use to go to it and just how far she's going to have to go to get the next hold. So if I were her, I would have made the effort to get my body as far to the left as possible and really gotten left and as high on this undercling as possible. So that way when I brought my right hand in, I could focus on kind of moving up up and to the left off of it and really driving through my toes and keeping that tension. So then she does opt, instead of going for the big swing and jump up to this yellow hold, she does reach out and get this undercling with her left. You can see she's got the thumb engaged, so she's pinching as well. This hold, the positive side is down and to the right, so she's going to be as up and left as possible. She can't pull herself up with this hold too, so having it be an undercling means that all the weight is going to be on her feet. As she moves around this hold, she's going to be able to get higher off of it by driving through her feet. And then she also checks out this kind of undercling hold, kind of seeing what the angle for one hand is going to be while still holding on to the start to kind of see what the position might be like.

This is a great visualization strategy in addition to sequencing to better understand if the beta they're intending is actually possible. Because if they measure this and see that they are nowhere near the size required to make this move, that indicates they need to use different beta. So the measurement definitely worked because Clamor was able to establish on the problem and identify a closer hold that they should be using.

Here we can see the climber getting positioned for a two hand hold start. Now each hand has its own hold and the reason why the climber chooses to position the right hand above and the other one crossed underneath is because the next hand to be released will be the left hand being the lower one. It's important that the climber positions sufficient pressure onto the grips which they do by extending the arms. Now since their climber is holding on with the arms extended has brought also the feet onto placement. Once the feet are off the ground and the climber is up in the air and totally holding the weight on the wall with the hands and with the feet down pressing and also gripping onto the holds then the climb will start. Here we can see the climber was able to move the right hand over to the next move, this one being at great distance. Now once the climber has applied pressure to both of the grips, the climber then had brought their left foot up for a next stance. This the climber would have had an easier time if they'd done this quicker as the right heel is hard to sustain when the leg is extended. Now that the climber has taken some time to do this, the heel hook had gave out. Here we can see the climber making hand gestures to memorize the sequence of the route. It's important that the climber gets to study the route before getting onto the wall. Here we can see the climber has brought their right foot at a higher stance, placing the heel in to inside the donut hold. Now the donut hold is similar to the hold that the climbers are standing with the right hand, slightly bigger. Now how heel hooks work is that the heel will be placed on the inside of the hold and right behind the edge of the lip. Now heel hooks are known to be stronger as it uses the power from the thigh, since the climber could use the power of the leg by bending it and pressing down inside to the hold, thinking of using it almost like a third hand. The climber can also in this instance move up by placing their left foot down below to then release their grips to go for the next hold. Now heel hooks are known to be really strong as the climber is also be able to move up a couple of series of moves at reach or for one big powerful move. Here we can see the climber actually had used the right leg to be extended. This is called flagging out and this is when the toe is pointing at the opposite direction from the hand going up being the left. So flagging out is a way for the climber to keep balance and also use as a tail as a climber will as it will help the climber create a twist on the side that the climber will need to go for the throw. In this case keeping the hip to the left side against the wall helps the climber gain more reach when making the stance on the left foot that was pressing down. Here we can see the climber chalking up the hands, which is the white powder that's spread out on the surface of the palms. Now, the chalk will help the climber to gain a better grip when holding onto the holds, and also absorb any sweat that may be coming from the hands.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It kind of looks floppy like it's not really creating tension or balance It's just kind of doing its thing And so it's kind of working against her it's gonna kind of cause her to have to kind of fight and gauge your core Because ideally she's gonna have to bring this left foot up to create the tension and take the tension from this right foot heel to kind of move about So we see that she does, she's able to walk her foot up. So she does cut her feet out, so now all that weight is going to be on her arms. So there's now no support through her feet. That's just going to be purely based on her upper body. So she's going to have to kind of swing back in, regain control, all that. So not the most ideal situation. So the starting position looks good. Her arms are crossed. I'm sure we should see what the next move is but they're nice and straight. She's kind of really leaning back not pulling in too much with one arm especially with this the arms being straight like they're crossed like this there could be some you know potential awkwardness and bouncing off. It looks like she's not pulling herself in with her arms but she's keeping a lot of tension through her through her shoulders and back and core and is really doing a good job driving down through her toes so it looks like a good starting position. And then she tries to get the left foot up in here, but you'll notice that these holes are just not really angled. It kind of makes it a little bit more awkward to get your foot into it. She's just not able to keep her foot in. I think partially too is because with the heel being so spread out, she's now kind of wanting to push with the foot and that heel is making it so she can only really pull down with it. So she's kind of at the end of the range for that movement of what's effective. And she does opt to do this high kind of right heel hook. This hold is a little bit weird though. While it's a really good hold, it's kind of narrow in width and it's kind of closed off. So I don't know how effective this heel hook is going to be. This might be, it could work, but also might be a better spot for toe because the toes will be able to fit in better. If she can get a good grip with her heel, this will be really good because then that heel will just be able to act as like another arm and pull straight down through this hold, freeing up her right hand to move anywhere she wants it to. Yeah, she's able to unravel and hit this higher left hand, but she is starting to get a little bit spread out. So you can see she's kind of now the new spot is left hand, left foot on. So she's moving her right foot here. You can see looking for kind of a new right foot to become opposite of pose. That does seem like maybe she's kind of fighting the core strain. That's kind of making her hips drop out by engaging this right arm. And this right arm is kind of fighting that and pulling yourself back into the wall. I think this is just because she's so spread out and she's kind of getting this barn door effect right where she's not only at her max reach, but she's also left hand, left foot on. So she's got max reach combined with kind of a potential barn door.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So here we have a cool start, this is a cross start. So right hand dangling down on this Waco Jug, and left hand crossing through underneath to this hold. And then just a left foot here down near the kicker. And this is going to be a classic rollout move, you don't need to even know the next move to anticipate that it's going to be a rollout move. As soon as this left hand releases, these hips are going to open, and the camera will be able to move left. And the climber is then able to cross over the plane of their body and grab this right hand here. You'll notice that the climber is pretty lateral and they're using a lot of tension through this right heel. I think this would be better achieved if this wasn't a heel and if it was a toe, you can get a lot more power out of it and also manipulate this leg a lot more effectively. Because the climber is so stretched out, it's made much more difficult because it's a heel.

This is for the help of the climber of keeping the hips towards the wall since the climber needed it for the reach on going left. Now that the climber has placed the hand above and is also sustaining on the pull up on the hold in front of them is able to move the leg that was out on the flag to a higher stance and this one being an edge secures the climber to place the front of their toe box to a more secure stand as the climber moves up to the route. Here we can see the climber was holding previously to the one-hold start where the left hand is remained in place and the right hand has moved up for the next move. Now the climber is still keeping the arms extended to apply pressure into the grips above and this one so that the climber is able to release pressure down at the feet in order to make the next move of being the left foot on a higher stance. We can see how the climber has brought the left leg over the right leg for the high placement crossing over and the crossing over eventually once the climber places the left foot onto the wall then the right foot will have to move over. Here in this case for the climber to maintain the right foot position needs to apply the weight quickly. A way of doing that is by the climber keeping the arms extended mostly on the left side while holding on to the grip above to then rock the right toe into the hold rather than just placing the edge of the toe at the ball of the toe box. The climber had the ball of the toe box just touching the edge and if the climber rocked the tip of the shoe towards it the climber will get more surface. Also leaning back will help the climber with applying sufficient pressure on and weight on weight transfer to the right foot that was above. Once the climber had secured the right foot then the left foot could have come up from place. The reason why the left foot might have come up from place was because the climber was remaining on a pull up which doesn't help with applying sufficient pressure to the left foot that popped off. Here the climber is reaching to the back onto a pouch. The pouch contains chalk and the chalk is spread out on the hands. This is so that the climber can have a better grip on the wall and also absorb any sweat that may be coming from the hands. Here the climber hasn't applied yet sufficient pressure to the right toe even if it has a secure stance with being the edge underneath the toe box. As the climber was trying to transfer the weight onto the right foot, the left foot has popped off prematurely from the foot chip. In this case, the climber failed to sustain the grips above due to being too close to the ground and also because the wall is in an incline which will make it really hard for the climber to recover from falling. Here we can see the climber has sent the right leg out to an extension and is not placing any foot chips. Instead the climber does a right toe tap against the wall. This one is called flagging out. The toe tap is helping the climber to help with the twist of the left hip going towards the wall as a climber will need to use the side of their body to be against the wall to have a better reach when placing their hand up to the extension while standing up on their left toe. The climber also does perform a forceful twist out left because every inch matters as the climber it makes the reach above. Here we can see the climber getting position for a one hold start where the climber places both of their hands in the same hold where this is called matching. The type of hold that the climber is sustaining is called the jug since the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the hold and able to lean down, leaning back to create more pressure on the grip. Now the climber will start the climb until both of the feet are off the mat. Once the climber's feet are off the mat then the climber starts.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She's on the left hand and everything looks good. It does look like her hand, when you look on the left side here, that maybe is on the outside of the hold. So maybe she didn't get deep enough and her grip's just not good enough, but she does kind of just attempt to move her foot up, her right foot up to this yellow hold and kind of just gives up and drops off the wall. So my guess is that she hit the hold, but wasn't able to readjust and get the better grip. And that's maybe where the twist lock coming is, especially on this move where maybe you have to be a little bit more accurate where the wall's filled in and you're trying to find where the good spot's hidden or a little deeper back. Using that twist lock should make you a little bit more stable and give you more time to get into the good position instead of having to latch so quickly and move so quickly. Here you can see she's got the nice straight arm, so she's now kind of in her new position. Left arm's a little engaged, keeping tension, but she's on this kind of left foot kind of side stepping. She could twist a little bit more into the wall, but she really drives from her feet. So you can see here, pushing with this right foot to kind of push her weight up and over so she can really extend with the left foot. So here she's starting in a nice position. Her arms are straight and engaged. Can't really see where her feet are but the feet are staggered as much as they can be especially being on this left side of the wall. She's kind of got to deal with this the edge or the arrette of the wall. But so far it looks like she's in a nice straight arm position. She's engaged so when she makes the first move she really does drive with her foot and pull with her arm. So it is a nice combo of using her feet and her upper body. And here's where I think she could utilize the side step a little bit, but she is keeping nice tension through her feet, so everything's nice and engaged. I think she could twist more into this right arm and kind of do a more twist lock variation technique where she really brings that left hip into the wall, really twists in hard to her arm, and that way she'll be really stable on the wall. Then she makes this first move. She does a really good job walking her feet through here to the right, getting opposite pose. So she'll be weighting this left foot while she's weighting this right arm to move up and around, up and to the left.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Reason why the climber tried keeping a pull-up position while sustaining the holds above and kept swinging their hips to bring their weight over to the wall and get the feet at a higher stance. The climber had pressed the toe and really tried, but at this time, the climber had gotten tired and dropped the hips, dropped the feet onto the mat. Here we can see the climber has sent the left hand at a higher grip. Now this is important of the climber to have planned this from the ground which is what the climber did before when having the arms crossed over from the first stance. Now since this is already on their second movement, it's using the same foot that they used from the start being the left foot and kept the right foot extended. The extended foot or extended leg, this is called flagging out which helps the climber to stay balanced and also help the climber with gaining leverage and reach as well as twisting the hip close to the wall which is their center of gravity. By the climber engaging the core to the left side and also stepping onto the left foot, it keeps the climber to stay even for the reach and gain leverage easily to reach the hold above. Here we can see the climber chalking up their hands. Now, it looks like a white powder that's over the surface of the palm. This is for helping the climber to gain a better grip when on the wall, as well as absorbing any sweat that may be coming from the hands. Here the climber has quickly transferred over the weight from the left foot that was on the chip down below to the right foot which is now being placed with heel in. The placement of the foot being heel in onto a donut that's similar to the right hand hold is called heel hooking which the heel sits behind the edge of the hold and will need to be pressed down with the leg folded to create that pressure. Now this was a little bit too quick to transfer the weight so it's important that the climber gets to apply the pressure of the heel carefully when supporting the holds above as well as like avoiding the swing to avoid peeling off the wall. Here the climbers are starting the climb by setting their hands at a two hand hold start. So since this is assigned to the route, each hand hold has a donut shape which is indented towards the inside to make a positive grip. As we can see the thumb is staying on the outside and can be used as a pinch while the rest of the hands are towards the inside. The climber to create pressure is keeping the arms extended and chooses to place the right hand at the top since the next move for the climber once they get to stand up on their left toe would be releasing the left hand to go out left which seems to be the next move to the route.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I also think too, it's like if she's going to put her heel, you know, at this point, her body's so far to the left that if she wants to put this heel in, you know, she's got to put, you know, this heel, she's got to put it in and pull it. And it's going to pull her this way when she's going up and to the left. So I think here, her problem is if she could set a toe, she'd be a lot more accurate with it, it'd be a lot more easier of a placement. And not only that, but it's going to help her push up to the left. So setting up for the next move is going to be a lot, lot better. So again a good starting position not fighting it kind of really staying down and driving into the feet keeping the arms nice and straight engaged overall looks pretty decent You know looking up looking at the next hole see where she's going so everything so far looks good Um, she's not starting out of position. So she is finding a good a good position to start from So we'll see if she'll maintain And then ultimately she's like, she's just not able to put the toe back in and she isn't able to hold the hold the swing and hold herself without her feet on anymore. So here we can see she hits this first left hand and then as she's trying to set this right heel she fails to keep the tension on her left foot and it picks off and she ends up cutting her feet here.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Most of the climbers weight is actually going through this right arm. And this left hand is essentially just touching this hold. Because most of the weight is coming from the left foot here and this right hand. The climber probably doesn't even really need to be grabbing in this hold. Often times you'll see a position like this and the climber will simply touch the other hold and continue moving through the boulder. So the climber swings out and tries to bury a heel into this Waco and then they try to get a toe in Which I think is the best beta, but they're just unable to maintain this position.

Now, the climber needs to gain extension and gain leverage. Now to gain leverage, the climber has stepped on both of the feet down below to do a stand up and to forcefully twist the hips out left to keep the left side close to the wall. It's important that the left side stays close to the wall as it will help the climber gain inches at the reach. Also it's important that the climber has a body position that would make sense for the climber to keep their left side towards the wall. The reason is that also the left foot was positioned with the outer side of the toe towards the wall to then the climber making a knee drop, meaning that the left knee is pointing inwards for the reach while standing up. Here, the climber had sent the hands onto the pouch attached to the climber. This contains chalk and will help the climber to gain a better grip when going onto the wall as well as absorbing any sweat that may be coming from the hands. Here it's important the climber reads the sequence well from the beginning. In this instance, it was forceful to throw the left hip out to the left side and sending the left hand over to the right side, meaning the hold after the start hold. In this case, it would be ideal if the climber placed their right foot where the left foot was and stand up to send the right hand up to the next move rather than the left one. Here the climber starts with a one hold start where both hands must be placed on the same hold. This is called matching. Now the climber in order to apply sufficient pressure to the grips the climber leans on to the grips. Keeping the arms extended can keep the climber with a position of not applying pressure onto the upper body. As the arms are extended this is called the wrist position and at this moment the climber has placed the feet onto the wall and no longer the hips are touching the mat. That means the climber is at this point has started to climb.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Arms are nice and straight. She's nice and engaged. But as she makes this first move, you can see that her right foot kind of lacks any tension. So I think in this case, especially when she's kind of pulling up and kind of, she's kind of square to the wall and so she's losing this tension. So I think if she twisted in, kind of got that left hip into the wall, she would kind of tension in and keep more rigidity throughout her body, keep the tension a little bit higher. So you can see she's not having to reach too far. She's kind of reaching up this left hand to this one and just right above the hold, but it is angled. So you can kind of see it's not a very good hold. It's like this pinch. So she's going to want her body as far kind of down to the right of this hold. So her starting position probably could have been a little bit different. But it's kind of like this, this it's I think this is where she needs to keep both feet on it to keep tension or keep balance in the right foot, because he merely wants to see she kind of grabs this hold. It seems like she tries to put all of her weight onto it and she doesn't have a right foot. So this right foot kind of swings out from the wall. So now it's like she's kind of barn dooring as she kind of gives up on the lower right hand. So I think this is a case where she wants to kind of be 50 50 on both hands and really engage on both the hands, not lose any tension anywhere. Because now she kind of shifts up to this higher hold, this higher left hand hold she's left hand, left foot. And she's not really in the position. She's still to the left of this hold when she wants to be, you can kind of see on here. So here's kind of the positive side. So the positive side is up and left. So she kind of wants to be down and right.

You see they're pretty maxed out with their left arm, so just a little bit more lock off for this climber and they'll probably be able to succeed on this move. Here we have a match start where the climber is starting crossed on this jug. There's a lot of reasons why a climber would start matched.

This one with the leg folded, knee pointing outwards to bring the hip as close as they can towards the wall. It's important that the climber carries their hips as close as the wall because it will help transfer the weight, which is the center of gravity, blade on the hips and to the hands and feet. Now the climber is also leaning back and sustaining the grip, both hands on the same hold. This is called matching and places the right hand over the left hand. The right hand is placed in purpose because it's the one that is going to be sustaining this hold when making the next move, releasing the left hand out to the following move. Here, now that the climber has a solid hold for the right hand, this one being a jug, where the climber is able to comfortably wrap their entire hand around the hold, the climber then is only needing to apply sufficient pressure by relying on the grip and leaning back onto the hold to create more pressure. Also not having the arm engaged, meaning on a pull-up, can help the climber gain some rest during the meantime. Now since the climber also has the right foot up, being the next one at stance, this one now is the right side is being the center of support and has let go of the left foot to send the leg over with the foot pointing to the left, right side, which is called back flagging and is flagging to have the climber keep balance and keep the center of gravity close to the base of support. Here the climber intentionally steps off. This is potentially because the climber's arms were engaged for such a long time and was unable to make the pull-up move for the dynamic reach. Here in this case the climber chooses to go back and apply the left foot back into the foot chip and quickly moves into a foot chip that is at a higher stance for the right toe. It's important that the climber makes a fine decision as having some inches difference of one foot over the other will help the climber gain inches when at the reach when making a move on the route. Here the climbers is starting with a two hold start. So that means that each hand has its own hold and the climber is holding it at a closed grip. Where you can see the knuckles are sticking out, meaning that this type of hold is called a crimp and is a very small edge that the climber is pulling onto. Now the climber also has a feet down below which we'll use to bring their hips close to the wall by bringing their knees at a wide stance. Once the hips are raised and the climber you know has started to climb and is glancing over for the next move. Here we can see the climber doing a toe in toe out, meaning that the climber must swap their toes onto the same foot chip. The foot chip is small so not both toes will be able to be placed on top of the chip. So the climber to release some of the pressure on the feet without peeling off the wall, the climber is hanging on tightly onto the grips above. And as we can see, the arms are being engaged so that the climber is applying more pressure at the upper body than down at the lower body and releasing slowly the left foot and rolling it out to transfer then the weight to the right foot that's taking place by rolling in the toe onto the foot chip. Here we can see the climber while going for the reach out with the left hand. The climber has brought their base of support as close as they can and does this by crunching the right side of the core to press down tightly while keeping the left leg out in the flag pointing out to the right side. While the climber was trying to make the reach to the left hand hold, the climber was tapping every now and then the wall and this one is to keep the climber from swinging and be steady while gaining leverage for the reach. Here we can see how the climber to reach the next move, being the right hand up, has brought their drop knee, which means that the right knee has folded inwards while standing on the foot chip down below. This helps the climber to keep the right side as close as they can to the wall and bringing their hip over to the right side. Bringing the hip over helps the climber to gain more reach or more inches for the reach.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

That's going to stabilize her then and balance her out to then be able to move her left hand up and around. And this kind of wide stance is like if her, I was gonna let her kind of bring her hips closer to the wall. If her feet are too narrow, it kind of pushes you out from the wall and can kind of interfere with how you, you know, use your hips and twist in. And so by staying here and kind of, yeah, it kind of lets us utilize a little more flexibility and transfer our weight from side to side. Then she gets to this position and kind of gets set up. You can see she's got, she's kind of anchored at this left hand, towing down at the right foot, so she has opposite pose. That would free up her right hand to kind of move up and grab any hold in this kind of area. But she just drops off the wall, so it's kind of hard to see. I can't tell if maybe her, maybe she just gripped this left hand a little bit off and just wasn't able to comfortably bear weight on it or pull really hard through it. Doing a really good job of kind of keeping both feet on and shifting her weight back and forth between them as she makes these mini hand movements. So kind of coming into this with her left hand matching her right hand, moving out to the left. So overall it looks really nice. Isn't overdoing it. The foot moves, is staying nice and engaged to the feet. Kind of let her make all these hand movements without wasting any energy. So maybe not starting in the most straight arm position. Arms are slightly bent but she does kind of have this nice staggered stance and she kind of, her body kind of hides it but it looks like she kind of does kind of a twist variation so she's kind of twisting her left knee in to kind of drive her hips up until left so I do like that aspect. So you can see she's able to get this high left hand without really her body position changing. And also she looks very nice, well balanced out, really owning this position. makes this first move and releases the tension and is still able to keep her toe on. So she has nice opposite pose. She's got the right hand up there and she's really nice straight arm, not fighting position. Her left foot's still towing in and she's able to release this tension from her right foot. You'll notice that as she does it, she tucks her foot up so when she rotates out it's more her core versus if that leg lost tension and was down and still straight. You have this much longer lever kind of pulling you back. And when she's able to get that hand up, she moves her feet around. So it's kind of like she's in a good position to start, maybe pulling with the arms a little bit, but then she makes the move. And then when she has the next move, she has this nice kind of wide stable stance. So I like that she is not just kind of playing catch up with her lower body, but it seems like she's, makes move, gets her feet into a nice position, and then continues to make moves. So that's, I do like that.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The climber then backsflats, backflags with this left foot, and that allows tension to come off of the left hand here, and they're able to put all of their weight into this right hand. And you can tell that the climber is pretty fresh, straight arm, and pretty comfortable just kind of sitting over this foot. And the climber isn't really even opting to match here, but a very powerful body position for this climber. So here we have a dual start left hand here on this hold, this X-Cold hold here, and then right hand a little bit lower, both feet pasted equidistance on the wall, and the hands and the feet make this square position which means as one appendage gets released it's going to create a lot of energy which results in a power move right off the bat which is very cool. And getting in a perch on the right hand or the right foot, a high right perch of the right foot, the climber looked like they were going to initiate up and right somewhere in here but just drop off the boulder, kind of not knowing what to do. And after getting the left hand up, the climber is able to get this left foot a little bit higher and now they're in a cross match on this pink hold here. The climber does a really good job at moving slowly out of this position, owning this left crimp and using a lot of good core tension through this right leg. The climber is able to cross up and get into this hold here. So a great first move from this climber.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The problem here was the climber had leaned back too far, losing the elbows to be close to the core. At this point the climber was forcing the grip by pointing the elbows out. That means that the climber is over gripping on the hold and this is no good for the climber because soon the climber could lose pressure. In this case the left hand has left the hold, reason for the fall. Here at this placement the climber while placing the toe out left makes a knee drop meaning that the knee is brought inwards and also pointed down so that the climber can get the left side of the body towards the wall and helps bring the twist over to the left side to help with the shifting of weight for the climber to then transition their left hand over to the undercling. Undercling is the handhold that the climber has at this moment where gets to slide the left hand underneath the hold and in order to sustain the undercling the climber places the hand underneath with the palm face up and to sustain the move for the undercling the climber must pull in towards the body keeping the elbow close to the core. Here the climber chalks up the hands by placing the hands inside the pouch to cover the surface of the palms with chalk. The chalk will help the climber to gain a better grip when on the wall as well as absorbing any sweat that may be coming from the hands. Here the climber once gets to secure the undercling supported by the thumb which is acting as a pinch. The climber usually gets to generate a lot of power when placing a thumb, especially on a closed grip. Now that the climber in this position has brought their knee from being on the drop knee to then point outwards. The climber does this by slightly dropping their hips back to reposition the leg and is pivoting over the left toe. As soon as the climber moves the knee outwards, the climber then does a stance where it brings the hips close to the wall. This is so that the climber can transfer the weight over to the feet. For more information visit www.FEMA.gov Here we can see the climber getting their hands placed onto the one start hold. Where both hands are placed on the same hold, this is called matching.

She's keeping a lot of tension through her feet, but she's not extending. So this one, you know, she engages her arms. It's just gonna pull her closer to the hold, but not drive her up the wall. So this is where she needs to really push down with her feet to get her body up above this hold and really stand into this hold. Also notice on the left screen, she's utilizing the bolt hole. So the bolt hole kind of provides a little extra grip for her thumb. So she can kind of pinch harder and grab harder with her right hand. So here she's starting with her arms bent again, kind of instead of sinking in. I just kind of forced her to make the move with her upper body. She is towing and giving a lot of tension with that left foot. And we'll kind of utilize a drop knee to kind of pull her weight to the left. You can see her kind of start to pump her arms in and try to make the moves with her upper body. And then she falls off so she's really just got to stand through those feet and push through her feet and drive her body up so that way she can kind of stand above the undercling. So I can see how she's using this left foot and dropping this left knee in. That's bringing her hip closer to the wall so she can reach over and grab this undercling. She is still quite locked off between both arms. So it does appear that she's exerting a lot of energy to make this move.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They're also going to a hold that's facing the wrong direction. So pretty complex movement here for the start. And here you see the climber blowing off of the undercling.

So here we have this match star left next to right, pretty standard. And the climber has fallen, but you can sort of start to see that the. Grip position is being tweaked. Um, this would technically in a climbing competition be considered a technical because you're not allowed to grab or use the holds outside of an attempt. So the fact that the climber fell and is now investigating this group position would count as an attempt in a traditional climbing competition. But nevertheless, um, what you're seeing here is more of a desired group position if the climber continues to try and go up right hand to this hold.

Now jugs or also buckets is what is called for this type of hold is because it has a giant lip meaning that the climber is able to comfortably wrap their fingers behind the hold and if they wanted to could press their thumbs on the other side creating a pinch to sustain a secure grip. Now we can see the climber performing a pull up and this is due to wanting to release some of the weight from the feet down below or in this case just to have brought the left foot out into a wider stance. The climber once they get to position the feet comfortably then the climber can extend the arms and have them at rest position which means that only the grips will be engaged rather than the entire upper body. It's important to know that the climber foot positioning will help for securing the next move. In this case the climber once secures the left foot placement then the climber must think about raising their hips up towards the wall and transferring it over to the foot that is at distance which is also the higher foot in place for the next reach. Here we can see the climber reaching out to the patch behind them. Now, the patch contains chalk which will help the climber spread it over the surface of the palm. This will help the climber to gain a better grip when holding onto the holds and the wall, and also to absorb any sweat that may be coming from the hands. The climber chooses to step off the wall. This is because the climber got stuck, meaning that the right foot was way too low for the climber then to make any performance on keeping the grip where they were at that stand and standing up over the right toe was inevitable to make the move up to the left side as the climber was already crunched up. If the climber was to do this again, the climber needs to think ahead of time for the foot positioning before matching the hold that was the undercling. Here the climber does a technical move of a knee drop, meaning that the left foot was placed toe in, top of the hold, and then has pivoted the outer part of the toe box to then bring the left knee inwards. This is called a knee drop. And it helps the climber to keep the left side close to the wall, meaning the hip, which is where the center of gravity of the climber is. And quickly has moved the left hand over to the next hold, this one being held from underneath. This is called an undercling, where the fingers slide underneath the hold, and instead of it's being pulled away to create pressure. To pull, to keep the pulling away for the climber, the climber must keep the elbow close to the core to sustain the hold. Here the climber gets in its first position, meaning that once both feet are off the mat, then the climb starts.

It's not quite clear what happens here, but she kind of just steps off the wall. I don't know if she could kind of not apply all the pressure to stand up through her feet, but she kind of just seems like she gives up. So here we can see she's using her left foot. She's dropping her knee in to kind of pull her weight to the left so she can get her weight kind of underneath this undercling and get her body just a little bit more under so she's more centered under it and not having to pull kind of into it.

So climber comes out of the drop knee and goes into more of a square body position and is able to get this undercling match. So they're putting a lot of force through their feet straight down now and pulling up really hard with both of their hands. Underclings are really difficult just inherently and this one seems, you know, difficult for this climber to a pretty large degree. So here we have a star position down pulled, down pulling on this hold that's facing slightly to the left of the usable surface. This is important because the climber sort of pitted over here to the right side and they're obviously moving to the left. This left foot is also pushing them this direction. So they're really having to fight a lot of force in order to move to the left right off the bat. Most of that counter pressure is going to be used by pushing this right foot down and aiding the climber to move the opposite direction that they're being forced into through the star position. So here you see the climber trying to thumb catch inside of the bolt hole. This is a pretty typical tactic basically The usable surface of the bolt hole is going to allow the climber to pinch this hold more effectively and thus gain a little bit More control out of the usable surface of the hold And is a good tactic So the climber utilizes this drop knee here and is able to get into the bottom left side of this undercling here. So they're putting force up on this hold, down on this hold, and then they're squeezing their feet together through this drop knee. And so the squeezing of the feet is really what's keeping their hips in and the hands are opposing forces up and down. So this is a difficult position to stay in for the climber and using that pace that I've talked about before is very important in achieving the next body position that the climber will be moving into.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

That's because this knee is facing like that, so she can't get her weight kind of left of this line, which is going to make it really hard to swing up to this left hand hold. It'd be possible, essentially, but it'd be way more in her arms than in her feet. So what she needs to do is get that knee, get the knee as far left as possible, so that she can just push straight down to this foothold as her weight is above it, so she can dyno up and dead point this left hand.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They're still utilizing this drop knee, but this is a bit more of a dynamic body position, swinging their hips back and forth. They're utilizing this drop knee on the in swing. As a coach, I would try and open up that knee and do this dynamic move square rather than drop kneeing because the drop knee is more of a binding situation as soon as this left hand opens up, their hips are gonna wanna open up and there's a potential for this knee to get in the way when it opens up. So it'd be better to do that on the front end. So as to generate more momentum, as well as a smoother transition from the start position to the target hold. So here the climber attempts to roll out that left hand and just comes up Pretty short on the hold and falls off the boulder again. I think this was worth Trying but the climber just seems pretty gassed which in climbing terms means very tired", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Everyone's kind of doing a similar problem as before. This foot's working against her and I can actually see in this frame her foot is cutting because when she, you know, if her knee was straight above it, toeing straight down, she'd be pushing straight through against the hold. But when she drops the knee in, you can see the shadow on this hold, you can see it's quite good. So when she drops her knee in and her foot's on like this, her foot is almost pushing or pulling against it and kind of pulling outwards instead of pushing down. So when she loses tension and the foot pops off, that whole left leg just drives straight from the wall, which is going to pull her whole body back away from the wall and allow her to reach up for the hold. And she does give it a second attempt, so I'll critique that too. For the second attempt, she tries to do the undercling method, but just kind of rapid fires it a little bit too much. I did like, so she utilizes the little drop knee technique here, you know, drops her knee in. So that pulls her hips close to the wall. And then when she gets that first left hand over, she kind of switches and she pulls that knee up and over, but then drops the other knee in. And so this kind of subtle change of direction with the hips kind of lets her rotate her weight around. And better utilize her feet and better position on the wall. So she almost becomes opposite of pose while having both feet on the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This the climber does by leaning back and keeping the arms extended while holding tight onto the grip above. This one being a jug can secure the climber for a positive grip which the hand wraps around. At the same time it's important that the climber can keep position the feet and keep them as stable as the climber performs the swing to generate power out left.

As you can see the climber has the white powder on the palms and this will help for the climber to gain a better grip when holding onto the holds as well as absorbing any sweat from the hands. Here when the climber goes out left we can see how the climber has done a knee drop with the left foot. We can see how the toe has been pivoting towards the outside part of the shoe onto the hold so that the climber can place their left side being the hip keeping the center of gravity out to the place of reach. Here, the climber starts by placing both hands onto the start hold. Both hands on the same hold. This is called matching. And below, the feet are placed.

It's important to have the right foot placement as the climber will need to sustain most of their weight on their feet when releasing the hands on the route. Now we can see with the left foot is in place on that foot chip where the climber has swapped their right foot with their left foot to be in place. And then once the climber is bringing the right leg over for the next stance for the right toe, the climber has performed what's called a knee drop, meaning that the knee is facing inwards to help keeping the climber left side close to the wall. Here the climber is getting positioned for the climb. In this case climbers are starting at a sit start. Sit starts usually add to the grade as they're difficult to come off from as the climber will have to pull their weight onto the holds that they're sustaining from above as well down on the feet when pressing. Now to bring the weight of the climber up would be by the climber raising the hips to then transfer the weight over to the hands and feet. Once the climber has raised their hips and their body is off the mat then the climb The Student is pointed at for landing. The climber lotus poses in this position as soon as the climber starts. Here when the climber was glancing over to their grips to make the next move, the left foot has come off from the foot chip down below. This one, due to the climber not applying sufficient pressure onto the left toe, then the climber touches the mat and means that the climb is over. The climber here is starting at a one-hold start, meaning that both hands must fit in the same hold.

One starts to think about this situation while they're in this situation. And oftentimes that can lead to little slip ups like this. So I think that this climber is doing something that's quite common, which is not respecting the moves, is how I coach this phenomenon. You have to respect every move, even if they feel easy the first time you do them. I think that's what's happening here. Here is a good look at this start hold slash foot hold for later. You can kind of wrap both hands around it. Boom. Boom. You don't necessarily need to grab it straight on. It's just kind of a protrusion from the wall that has a lot of usable surface.

This one was a quick stump because the climbers left foot has come out of place. This one due to poor pressure on that left foot. The climbers right hand has come into a match at the same small weco. This one is sharp so the climber, since it's a small weco, can only fit a few fingers into the hold. So it's important that the climber manages on pulling himself in to release some of the pressure until he gets to adjust the fingers. The climber made the move of the right hand up due to applying his right foot into placement onto a higher hold. And has released the left foot to extend the leg. This is called flagging. And that helps the climber to keep his hips square so he's able to raise the hips and transfer the weight over to the high foot being in place. If the climber was going to attempt this again, it would have been fine if the climber continued to hold on to the hueco with the hand placement that he had, but needs to make sure to continue to apply pressure accurately at the feet and not have a miss happen like not applying sufficient pressure at the foot placement. If the climber was able to continue to have the foot placement on the lower foot and once he applied the right foot on to secure the top hold, then the climber could in control release the left foot that would potentially go into a flag while he leans on the grips to then make the next move. The climber is starting at a two-hand hold start. Each hand has its different hold. In the right hand, the climber is sustaining it as a pinch hold, which meaning that the climber puts the fingers on one side of the hold and on the other side the climber applies the thumb. The left hand is in a small, shallow edge, so the climber cups the hand, making a very tight grip, placing the fingertips above the shallow edge and places the thumb towards the fingers. This way the climber was able to engage and give it more power on a closed grip. Once the climber secures the hands, he will be able to then engage the arms with the left hand. Being such a closed grip, he will have to drive the elbow close to the wall while he engages the elbow out of the wall to sustain the pinch. Once the climber gets his fit position into the wall and the body is no longer on the mat, then the climb will start. because of the climber's poor placement at the feet. It had the climber over engage the grip. As we can see, the climber only was able to fit a few fingers when in place and overcompensating the few fingers that he has on place would not be good for the climber to continue on the climb. Reason why the climber has dismounted. Once the climber secures the grip, this one, both hands on the same hold, this is called a match. The climber is able to match the feet down below and it's important the climber glances over at the feet and the matching in this instance for the feet is because the climber is attempting to do a foot swap. This one the climber brings the left leg that was out on the flag to bring the toe to come into place at the hold. The climber needs to continually apply pressure at the feet so he doesn't lose the climber coming out of place. So he places the left toe to push down on the hold before releasing the right toe from place, meant. It makes sense that the climber has brought the left hand up for the next placement. The left hand was on a nub sort of hold that has a very small edge. This is sort of like a foot chip or a jib, meaning that the climber has only a small edge so the climber can only fit the fingertips. The right hand being a more promising hold to sustain as it has more surface, the climber is able to pull himself into the wall, raising his hips to keep his center of gravity close to the wall as he makes the stance by pushing down on the left foot to gain height. The right foot has been tapping against the wall with the leg extended which helped the climber gain direction of transferring the hand over to the left. The left hand goes up into a weco hold, meaning that there is a sharp edge at the edge of the hold and the climber is able to place it into the inside of the hold. The fingertips are now catching behind the edge of the hold and the climber, once making the hand placement, will be able to drop weight in order to create pressure.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

That way he can leave room for his right hand. So that way he can have both his hands in there and pull from it. And it looks like it's maybe more of a strength thing. It looks like he's grabbing the handhold kind of open, you know, more passively with two fingers on each side. And it looks like that's just affecting how much he can pull. So maybe in the future, you know, going to it normal with the left hand and crimping it or having a more aggressive grip on there and leaving just a little space for the right hand. So that way he can really, really pull down at the left and get his feet up.

This helps the climber to push onto the right side while the climber continues to drop the weight by pulling on the hands. But the climber needs to continue to engage the core to be raised so the climber does not disengage on the pressure that he is applying at the feet. The climber when swinging out to the left, this one was a forceful swing so the climber has yet to apply sufficient pressure onto the grip, reason why the climbers fingers has slipped out of the hold. The climber is ready to make the next move. He does this by dropping the left foot from its place, keeping this one as a flag so that the climber is able to bring his hips close to the wall when engaging on the pull-up. And whenever he's ready, he will then push forcefully on the right toe against the edge so that the climber is able to release the right hand that is placed the lowest up for the next hold. The climber quickly brings the right foot to come into a match at the hueco. This one the climber has the right hand placed inside of the hueco and because it's rounded and has a sharp edge the climber is curling the fingers inside of that hueco and for the hand placement the climber is pulling the hand towards him to keep it in place. But the climber sending the right toe inside of the hold now the climber is pushing the edge away so this so the climber is able to cam the position with matching hand and feet inside of the hold. Then the climber will be able to release the left foot from its place since it's the one at distance. The climber was struggling on fitting both of the hands onto the small hueco. This one because it's a sharp edge, the climber is able to curl the fingers inside of the hold, but there isn't enough space for the climber to lay flat the fingers on the hold as it's rounded on the inside. So the climber thus performs a couple of small pull-ups in order for him to find adjustment on the grip. It's important the climber always glances down at the feet to make sure the hay makes an accurate foot placement So the left foot before was initially in a hold and the right foot was pushed against the wall when the climber was going up for the left hand Grip being on a small wickle hold at the edge. So the climber makes the right foot placement and Has released a left toe He moved the left hand due to the Shallow hold not being a very promising hold for him to sustain and the reason why the climber kept the right hand Being still in place at the start hold the climber had sent the right hand to come into a match at the same edge where the left hand is. So in this case the climber in order to drop the weight he needs to continue pulling on the hold and as we see the climber is ready to engage for the next move. To do so the climber will have to push the right foot down and away which will help the climber to throw him over on the opposite direction when going up for the reach. The left leg being extended this is going to act as balance which helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the highest foot as is the one that he needs to provide more power from. The left leg being extended eventually he will rise it up to turn his body to the left side towards the wall which can help the climber have a more efficient reach with his left hand when having the left side of the body towards the wall. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet, especially if they're at a distance, when making a foot swap. Now the climber is bringing the left toe to come into place at the hold before the climber releases the right toe from its place. It's important that the climber continuously apply pressure onto the foothold so that he doesn't come off from the wall. As soon as the climber made that right foot placement, the climber had quickly extended the arms so that was onto a rest position and engaged it onto a closed pull up quickly so that he was able to move his left hand out at reach to the next hold. This, the climber needed to hold on to a lip or edge of the hold that's sticking out with a groove where the climber placed the fingers inside that groove to sustain the grip. As we can see, he needs to drop the weight onto the hold so he forces the elbow by pulling on the hold. Now the climber was able to go out to the left due to pushing down on the right foot being in place on the opposite direction. If the climber was going to do this again, there could be different ways of making this approach when completing this boulder problem. So especially in this area, because the hold is a distance, he decided to commit into a dynamic move to make the placement into a good hold. He wasn't able to apply sufficient pressure at the grip, reason why the climber slipped off from the hold, but he could potentially try it again and know exactly how much pressure he would have to give it the next time that he goes. The other way that the climber could approach going up to this move would be on performing smaller moves or moves that the climber would have to do more matches and use more moves in order to get up to this hold. The climbers is starting at a two hand hold start, meaning that each hand has its own hold and both of them are different. The right hand being a pinch hold as the climber is placing the hands on one side of the hold and the thumb onto the other. The thumb being engaged will add a lot of force into that grip which the climber will have to clamp down in order to and squeeze the hold in order to apply force to the pinch once dropping the weight onto the grip. Same thing with the left hand, it's different because it's a shallow edge so the climber is placing the fingertips above the hold and sticks out knuckles as we can see which he will have to create a very close grip and press the thumb onto the side once being placed. This is important that this hold is held with the elbow being as close to the wall as he can to apply pressure onto that left hold. because this move is a hold that is a distance, the climber pushes the right foot forcefully, losing the foot placement. So this was a committing move but also a promising hold for the climber to go for since it's a jug and we can see how the climber makes the placement with the fingers wrapping around the lip of the hold and twists the wrist to go inwards so the climber can hold the position since the jug is positioned slightly with the opening to the right and it needs once a climber has detached or done this dynamic move he will go out on a swing and needs to apply pressure by leaning under it The climber has reached a stillness and control of his weight management. This one because if the climber was dropping too much weight for far too long on the grips, it could tire the climber's grips. Reason why the climber is matching the feet at the same hold and raising the hips. Once the climber has secured the grip of both of the hands fitting in the same edge of the hold, the climber then engages on a close pull up to remove the only foot being in place, the right foot, to come into a high placement. He does this because that will help him when making the next move. The climber before making the right hand move up for the reach, he also had engaged for a little bit too long on the wide pull up which could have potentially tired his hands in order to stick the move. As we can see the climber has brought the right hand into a match only stepping Or having his foot placed onto that right foot while keeping the left foot extended not in any holes This so the climber was able to only apply transferring the weight to the right foot being in place that helps him to Push down and onto the right so the climber has an easier way of releasing the Right hand to come into place going on the opposite direction The left foot not being in place also helps a climber to drop the weight on the grips that are in place Here the climbers is starting potentially at a step up start or a sit-down start. However the climb won't start until the climber gets to raise the hips onto the wall and the climber is positioned while distributing the weight onto the limbs being on the wall. Where the feet right now are placed below, left foot on a foothold and the right foot could potentially be against the wall or a foothold. Now the climber is aiming at the next hold being at reach which he will then have to engage onto a close pull up at the grips that he has and then step up pushing down on the feet in order to make the reach.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Really pushing down through these and he loads up the feet. You can tell he's toning really hard. And so that's really important because we want to not only just place our feet on the hold, but really aggressively push into the feet and really get as much out of them as possible. So it looks like this time around he's got more fingers or more actively gripping that left hand so hopefully he can get a little bit more pull out of it and kind of be a little bit more aggressive with his position on it. And then here he's kind of going for this big cross and he kind of Runs out of feet so he decides to jump for it But I think what the move is is matching on this foot and then get a heel up here And doing a heel hook kind of match so you could kind of statically pull up and over instead of jumping and kind of Having to be extra big and extra dynamic with it And he cuts feet here and so I think what it is is I think maybe he was just too extended. So by cutting his feet he's able to kind of lock his arms off and get a little bit more pull out of this position. That kind of muscles his way through it instead of having to kind of be lanky and spread out. So that looks pretty good.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I do believe this is a jug, so you could hold this swing. Although I think there might be an option to hand-heel match in this hold. Maybe we'll see on later attempts, but I do think that this way goes. So after gaining a hand-foot match in the Waco crimp here, the climber is able to get in and match this left hand and continue to progress up the wall. Here you have the climber in this Waco crimp again here attempting this match. Now the climber I think actually uses lower feet this time. I think that might be helpful in matching this Waco crimp somehow. Climber is then able to maintain the right foot here in the Waco crimp, come out left to this pink pinch hold here. And after successfully matching this Waco Crimp, the climber is able to work their feet higher and pounce up into this left hand hold here. The usable surface on this hold is facing this way, as well as in the Waco Crimp it is facing this way, which makes the hips kind of want to peel out this direction. And this foot is really the only thing stopping that, so it's a pretty compromised position.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This can compromise the climber from his position to achieve the climb so the climber quickly brings both of the hands onto the jug and even if he's placed upside down he's able to pull on the grip as he's able to curl the fingers inside the hold. Think of it as a chin up so he pulls himself in so that way he can engage on the core to eventually bring the foot that is out of distance to come into place. Now the left toe is still being in place because the climber is forcing onto a hard toe hook behind the lip of the hold and keeping the leg extended to drop the weight on that foot. The climber has dropped the right foot intentionally out of the wall. This is called cutting feet as the climber slightly swings out of the wall and there is no contact of feet on the wall while he sustains on the holds. He bumps his right hand over to the left side of the hold. Here we can see how the climber has brought the right foot to come into a high placement by bringing the heel into place on top of the edge of the hold and towards the wall. This is called heel hook. So because of the climber making the high placement, he will be able to push down on the hold as well as pulling the hold towards him. So heel hooks are known to be technical and powerful foot placements as the climber will be able to rely on it when making a series of moves, a one big move, so that he can keep himself steady by bringing his center of gravity close to his area of support, this one, the heel hook being in place. Because of the forceful push, the climbers foot being released could have had the climber swinging over the opposite way but the climber tense the body and to stop the swing as he needed to not lose any pressure at the right hand grip when being placed. So he engages the core and brings the right foot into a high stance so that he can quickly move out from this wide pull in order to make the next move. Here, the climber is making his way up to make the right hand placement over the lobe of the hold. This one, the climber must apply an open-handed grip in order to add friction when dropping the weight onto the hold. So the climber immediately engages on a pull-up as soon as he had pressed the left hand pinch and steps on the left toe even harder. And pushing the hold down helps the climber to gain direction of his right hand going up. As we can see, the right side of the climber is facing the wall and this is because the climber has kept the right leg extended, which this is called a flag, that helps the climber bring his center of gravity close to the wall and twist his body to the right to support when the climber goes up for the reach. As the climber had pulled himself in with the heel hook, he quickly releases it and this had the climber swinging away from the wall to quickly bring his right foot to come into a placement above the hold by pressing down with the toe. The climber moves quickly, once making the right hand placement, to then bring himself into a close pull up. Once the climber brings the right hand all the way up by his shoulder, this is called a lock off. And the climber, while keeping balance onto the one foot that is being in place, while the right leg being extended, is the one that he uses for balance to keep his hips square as he sends over the left hand to come into a high position at the lip. Here we can see how the climber has brought the left hand to come into a match at the same hold, holding to another lobe. So the hand is being cupped and the right leg was also dropped. This so that the climber is able to apply pressure over the highest foot. The climber's next move is bringing the right hand up to the next hold. This one the climber drops the foot so that he's able to twist the body into the wall when going up for the reach. The climber was able to recover his right leg that was gone out of place and quickly sends the foot inside of the hold to apply the toe behind the edge of the hold. Now both of the toes are toe hooking behind the edge of the hold, meaning that the climber's toes are pressed against the edge towards the inside of the hold and the climber extends both of the legs and keeps them steady in order to drop the weight and pressure onto the feet. It's important that the climber does not try to bend his legs, otherwise he would lose pressure at his feet. And at this moment the climber is upside down, so his last hold is where his left hand is and must release the right hand to bring it to the last hold. The climber is starting at a one-hold start. As we can see the climber places both of the hands into the same hold. This is called matching and he applies a pinch grip in order to sustain the hold. He will drop the weight into the hold until he secures the grip and the thumbs apply extra force onto the pinch grip. The climber then will drop the weight onto the grips once placing the feet onto the wall. Once the feet are off the mat then the climb will start. Here the climber was out on the swing and quickly engages in the core while being in the wide pull up to make his foot come up to the slot to have a high foot placement as he will need to eventually drop his weight on the feet. The climber then sends the right foot first into place and as we can see the climber places it into the hold and the climber brings the foot to be pulled down towards the hold. The climber then sends the left leg to bring it over the other foot. This one the climber places it in and to be pushed towards the top of the hold. This both of the feet are pushing at different directions which will create a camming position for the climber to sustain the hold with his feet as he will need to release the right hand from its position later on. The climber quickly has released the left hand to bring it into the next position. This one being a jug, the climber is able to comfortably hold on to this hold because he's able to wrap the hand around the hold, sending the fingers behind the lip of the hold and the climber is able to apply pressure by pulling on the grip. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet when making a foot switch. Now the climber brings the left foot to be positioned in the same hold. This is called matching and brings the left toe box to be placed on top of the edge of the hold to apply pressure first before releasing the right foot from its place. As we can see, since the climber was able to bring his left foot over, his main areas of support are the right foot and this moment in the right hand. The left hand is no longer in a pinch and instead the climber is just pulling himself over to the left side to create pressure with the fingers that are placed on this side. When the climber does the foot switch and places the left foot, then the climber will be able to release the left hand for the next move. The climber must demonstrate control over the move and also stability when sustaining the last hold with the two hands. In this case the climber is able to keep the feet pressed and is holding with both hands onto the hold. The climber is not swinging or doesn't look unstable so the climber has completed the climb. because of the forceful push of the left toe against the hold we can see how the climber has released the toe from the hold and this because the climber needed to create a jump in order for the climber to gain distance for the right hand placement. The climber brought his left foot to come into placement and the right foot is not placed on any holds and instead the climber keeps it extended so that he's able to transfer over the weight of the climber to the highest foot. The climber is able to then step on the foot to allow the climber to gain height and that's how the climber got to move out of the first placement to send the left hand for a grip and this one being also a pinch hold that is placed vertically.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So he's able to kind of relax, get opposite pose, use right hand, left foot. He's able to match the sequence, that way he can go up right hand to this next hold, which kind of limits the distance he needs to move up and to the left. So kind of by matching and doing this sequence, it's going to save him some overall distance in the end. So again, kind of starting on this hole, this foot hole is kind of slanted. While it looks positive, the angle is pretty severe, so as he moves upward, it's going to be harder and harder to kind of push through it because he's going to want to be as perpendicular to it as possible. So he'll have to maintain a lot of pressure and sideways pressure instead of just being able to kind of standing on his foot and pushing down, he's got to kind of push against it. And here you can see it kind of cuts free, so it's kind of the same rules apply being opposite opposed. So his body's kind of barn dooring out, that foot's kind of whipping away. So overall, you know, keeping that tension, keeping that balance is going to save him energy in the long run. He's able to utilize his high heel hook so this hold is a little bit higher. So if you were to try to toe down on it, it's going to kind of push him out and away from the wall. But by putting his heel on, he's really able to take and tension that and suck his hips into the wall. He's able to just jump off of this. He moves fast enough that he doesn't have to worry about being opposite post. When he drives, he has left hand and left foot on. He's able to use his right foot to almost pendulum and swing. So when he swings his foot the opposite way, he's able to transfer that momentum and aid himself going up.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The climber is pretty lucky that this right toe hook did not spill because they are still on the wall and it's definitely pretty exciting based on the crowd reaction. And the climber was able to get into this purple jug, match hands, and drop down into this left-hand orange hold here. And they're in a pretty comfortable position. So here we have the climber in this general start of this boulder. Star hold is on this flat pinch rail. The climber is now in this descending pinch, which looks like a fun pinch to grab. I like these kind of holds. And after bringing that right foot back in and getting these toe hooks nice and snug, the climber is able to get down and do this inverted finish hold situation, which is really fun. This is a quintessential bat hang that we see here. So here we have the climber with their feet above their head. He knows that their feet are crossed. That is something that we'll need to change, but they are matching in this jug down here. So already setting themselves up to be in a nice body position. So here the climber was able to get into this tufa where they then matched and now they're crossing right hand into this Almost cactus look and hold and I think that this is the best beta to use I seen climbers go left hand here But going right hand in is very smart", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Reason why the climber is cutting feet at this moment. Now the climber must Hold tight onto the grips in order to bring himself close To the wall and as soon as the climber brings Comes back in that momentum of the swing the climber must engage on the core to make a high foot placement The climber had brought the left hand to come into a match where the right hand was. The climber continues to keep his left foot into place after that foot switch. The climber uses the momentum of the transition of once the left hand came into place for the match, the climber releases the right hand to be sent over to the last hold. The climber had then brought his left hand into the jug, matching the hold, and the climber quickly sends the left leg to be extended to tap it against the wall. This helps the climber to have direction when making the reach outright, as he engaged on the pull up and twist his shoulder over to the right side to send the right hand over to the last hold. The climber chooses to lower his heel hook placement and brings the feet down at a match again. This one assuming that the climber will be placing the right toe to come back onto the foothold to release the left foot from its place. The climber was able to bring the left foot into a high placement after cutting feet and quickly brings the right hand to come into a match. Now the climber is glancing over to the next hole, this one being a jug, where the climber then will have to commit into again bringing his center of gravity close to the wall to send the next hand up reach. The climber performs a slight swing to build momentum in making the dynamic reach. This one the climber is completely extended and as we can see he keeps his right leg extended to push against the wall so he is able to sustain the twist of the body as he is making the reach. This was a good choice of the climber to return the right foot to its placement because the climber once extended the left leg, he tapped the toe against the wall. This helped the climber to transfer over his center of gravity to the right foot being in place and also helped the climber with the twist of the body going over to the right side while keeping his hips square. This helped the climber for when he engaged on the closed pull up for going up to the reach on the stance, the climber when making the twist helps the climber gain extra inches to make the reach. As we can see, when the climber is making the reach, he is not looking at the hold and instead looks away. This helps the climber gain a couple inches so that he is able to make the finger place on top of the hold. Here now the climber has brought the right foot at a higher stance sending the heel into the wall and behind the lip of the hold. This one because it's a jug, the climber is able to secure the heel inside of the hold between the edge of the hold and the wall. Heel hooks are known to be strong foot placements as the climber would be able to use it almost as a third hand because he will be able to pull his center of gravity towards his foot being the area of support. And also when the climber needs once gaining height will be able to push down on the hold for him to secure the foot placement making him gain height. Heel hooks are also strong where the climber can make a series of moves while maintaining that foot placement or making one strong reach. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet. In this case, the climber right now has matched the hands above onto the same jug, being sideways. So the climber needs to lean to the left of the hold to create pressure and sustain the grip. Now, focusing on the feet, the climber is bringing the left foot to come into place and applying pressure first before releasing the right foot from its placement. Here is a good use of the climber that he applies pressure over their last hold and extends the arm so that he's able to sustain the grip. This is another jug so the climber can bring his fingers behind the edge of the hold and lower his center of gravity by dropping the right foot away from the wall and this one is hanging so this is used as a tail and helps the climber for stability and balance when transferring the weight of the climber over to the areas of support. In this case the climber is keeping the left toe on the wall so he doesn't swing out but has pushed the climber over to the right side. This time the climber as he lowers his center of gravity now he can make an easy transition of the left hand coming over to a match at the last hold. The climbers are starting at a sit start. Sit starts are known to add a grade of difficulty onto the climb. This is because the climber will have to place the feet and then raise the hips by sustaining the holds above, adding weight into the limbs. This is when the climbers are starting at a two hand hold start so each hand has its own hold. Once the climber places the feet and brings the hips up in the air, then the climb will start. The climber is making a foot switch and this one the climber seems crunched up so he will do this Foot swap quickly once he applies pressure of the left toe onto the hold he can then release the right foot The climber taking advantage of the swing back, he makes a high foot placement where he's matching the left hand and the right toe. Once the climber applies pressure of the toe against the hole, the climber will be able to release the left hand to be positioned to the next move. So far the climber has gone through a series of jugs. Jugs are known to be beginner holds because they have a safe grip where the climber can close the grip by wrapping the hand on the edge of the hold. This last two holds, they were upright and on this one the climber's jug is now sideways meaning that the entry or the hole where the climber needs to wrap the hand is onto the right side and he's bringing his left hand over. In this one the climber will eventually need to lean back on the hold since this one is placed sideways creating a side pull as the climber gains height. The climb will be determined to be completed if the climber can demonstrate control and civility over sustaining the last hold. In this case, the climber is able to control the move and sustain the hold for a period of time, so the climber has achieved the climb. Because the climber was able to sustain the top grip being a jug, meaning that it's a positive hold, where the climber is able to wrap the hand around and sustain his weight by closing the grip, he can keep the arms extended and also the right hand has a positive hold. The climber is able to trust the grips and cut feet so that he's able to replace the feet at a better stance for the next move. Cutting feet is when both of the feet are off the wall. The climber moves quickly from the two hand hold start and brings the right hand to come into match with the left hand. Matching is when both hands are in the same hold. We can see that this is a jug because the climber is able to place the fingers behind the hold and is sustaining to the lip of the hold. Now the climber is glancing to a hold at reach. This one the climber will have to bring his side of the body of where the hand will be making the reach. This one being the left hand as we can see the climber is folding the left leg to go inwards. This tells me that the climber is preparing to send his left side towards the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So does a good job kind of squatting low, loading up the feet, keeping the arms nice and straight so he's not kind of fighting the position, kind of pulling up on himself to take tension away from his feet. He attempts to kind of put a heel hook up on this hole, which would be a good idea, because then you can kind of use that to pull down, which is going to bring his body up the wall and let him kind of pull more with his feet instead of having to push.

This builder does not really ask any questions of the climber. It's just a little too easy. It doesn't really stress the climber out. It doesn't really separate any of the climbers from one another. It actually makes it a little bit more difficult to annotate, just because the climbers aren't really doing anything of consequence within this boulder. It's not a big deal.

This bringing the right side of the climber close to the wall instead of the chest, which helps the climber stay even closer and bring his center of gravity over to the right foot. This to gain direction, the climber then will have to eventually engage on the right foot and continue to look at the hold to send the right hand into place. The climbers is starting at a two hand hold start. Both of the hands have its own hold and as we can see both of them Are donuts that are slightly shaped Differently so the right hand we can see how it's indented With more of a group on the inside for the right hand This one making it more positive to hold on to as a climbers able to curl the fingertips inside of the hold and this is rounded So the climber is able to create more power at the grip By placing the thumb on the outside and pinching onto the bottom area of the hold for the left hand is also another donut, but the climber has more of a flat surface towards the inside and Shallower groove towards the inside so the climber also places the fingertips at the very inside of that hold and keeps the thumb on the outside to create More grip by squeezing the bottom area of the hold Now the climber Has stepped off the mat and places the feet onto the wall That means that the climb has started and we can see how the left foot has a smaller hold than the right foot the right foot the climber is able to place most of the foot sole against the surface of the hold and The climber is keeping his arms extended to drive His weight over to the grips Here the climber is going on a swing because the climber for a fraction of a second has pushed the right foot prematurely on midair. So it's necessary that the climber pushes the foot accurately so that the body can follow going on that direction and not be sent away where he's now greatly swinging, unable to sustain the hold. And if the climber can send the left hand to the same reach, then it will help the climber support the grip. As the climber was gaining height, the climber then pushes down on the right foot for a boost. This the climber then is turning his chest towards the wall which make it easier for him as he's close to the wall on the direction that the climber is going for. So now the climber must bring his right hand to come and slap the top of the hold in order to sustain the grip. Here, once the climber has placed the hands and feet and secured the grip and placement, then the climber now is engaging onto a swing. This will help the climber to build momentum to make a powerful stance, which this is called a dino, since the hold is a distance. And the climber, once extends the arms and lowers his center of gravity, he will then swing hard to the right side, bringing himself to be airborne. Once the climber brings his center of gravity at being fully standing up with the grips in front of him, he will then have to pull himself in by bringing the chest towards the wall and lastly, stepping over the right foot to give himself a boost before he is completely mid-air. Once the climber is in the air, he will have to bring his right hand over to the hold at distance and make sure that he continues to stare at the hold, making sure he picks the area where he wants to place the right hand.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He just needs to hold the hold. Here we can see he hits it pretty nicely square on the top. By this time his arms are fully extended. His left arm is not in a position to catch as well. He's already swinging out so far from the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Really great sort of pre-jump movement. The climber was super static and then one pump and then fire. And the climber is already sort of initiating a really nice jump here. The climber is able to get it with one hand here and gets a pretty nice swing. The further you swing out on a hold, the better you get it. You might pick off, at least with this hold, when the climber swings more, it means that they got into the hold a little bit better. So it is a nice attempt here.

The climber was able to widen the stance. This one so that the climber soon lowered the center of gravity and pulled himself forcefully towards the wall to engage into the high reach. This one continuing to bring the hips close to the wall when making the reach. As we can see the climber has committed into a forceful pull into a high reach. This one the climber was able to place a hand behind the lip of the hold, this one being another jug. So the climber is able to, once placing the fingers on it, the climber then pulls on it to weight the grip. As we can see, when the climber was going up for the reach, the climber is keeping his right side towards the wall. This because the climber, once had made the right foot position, the climber brings the knee inwards. This keeps the climber's body on the twist aided by the left foot being tapped against the wall with the leg extended. The climber is performing a foot switch down below and it's good that the climber always glances down at the feet when making the switch. This is because the climber will hold on tight into the grips. In this case, the climber is bringing the right foot to come into placement where the left heel is, which the climber must release some pressure by the areas that he has in contact with the wall. And then quick, the climber picks up the feet, sending the right toe to come into the placement where the left toe is. If the climber was going to try this again, his right hand was at a high placement on a jug. This one is a positive jug, meaning that the climber could be able to sustain that hold for a while longer. The left hand was in a monohold. That one, the climber can only endure in that grip for so long. Potentially the climber's grip was getting tired as he was trying to make that foot placement. However, the right hand was before on the hold right under the monohold. That would have been a great position for the climber to bring his left foot since this one has an edge that the climber could place a toe to make it into a high feet in order to release the left hand from its monohold. This combination would have been a good one at the area where the climber was before coming off the wall. The climber is only able to apply one finger being the middle finger instead of the hold. This is then a mono hold. As the climber holds on to the mono hold he had placed the palm facing up and placing the finger and curling it in to the best of his ability which probably is just tapping the fingertip inside of the hold while closing the grip. The climber is engaging almost into an undercling hold as is the palm facing up in front of him. So he must pull this hold away from the wall to sustain it while continuing to apply pressure on the bottom hold with the right hand to pull towards him and down. Now the climber needs to make a foot switch. This one to bring them higher as the climber when gaining height he will eventually need to bring his lower hand up to the next hold that reach and the climber will be able to hold on to the monolithic hold to come as low as his waist when he's gaining height. But as he gains height he must continue to pull the hold by bringing the elbow close to the core. The climbers next hold it's a mono hold meaning that the climber will have to pick the strongest Finger and his hand in order to be placed inside of the hold now The two fingers that are the strongest in the hand are the middle finger Then follow the index finger if the climber is able to fit both of the fingers inside of the hole of the hold Then this is going to be called a two finger pocket Otherwise the climber will only slide in the middle finger being the strongest one to sustain the grip To apply the grip the climber will have to place the finger and then close the hand Curling the finger inside of the hold in order to apply pressure Here the climbers is starting at a set start and set starts are known to be difficult because it adds a grade to the climb. So in this set start the climbers is starting with a one hand hold start meaning that both of the hands will be placed on the same hold and this is called matching. Also the type of hold that the climber is sustaining at this moment is a jug so the climber can comfortably place the entire surface of the palm over the hold and as we can see the climber is making a placement of the feet. In this one the climber after placing both of the feet he will then rise his hips transferring over the weight to the limbs being in position then the climb will start. Here the climber glances once again to bring a left foot to come into place before releasing the right foot. The right foot will be extended into a flag as the climber will only need to use the left foot to press down when making the transition of the left hand coming up for the next reach. Here the climber sends the left foot to be extended leg. This one so that the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the foot being in place. Now the climber as soon as done the foot switch he lowers his center of gravity because right now he is about to commit a dynamic move as he stretches the arms hanging tight onto the grips and when he's ready he will pull himself in towards the wall making a pull up to then later on step up on the right foot and the left foot will be extended out and potentially tapping the toe against the wall when needing to sustain his stance at a height. The climber moves the left hand out of the start, this one coming to a jug, which is a beginner hold because the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold. And once the climber secures the grip by closing it, then the climber will be able to apply the weight onto the hold by extending the arm.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

You can kind of twist more into it. You'll see he's got left hand on, right foot on. This left foot kind of flags out. And he's able to kind of pivot around and kind of turn into this arm. So he could turn a little bit more into it. It is kind of a gas stone. So his pressure is kind of going down at an angle instead of being able to pivot down and right. So kind of go up and around it. But does a good job getting opposite posed. So here he's kind of starting with a heel hook so he can kind of pull his body in. Find that pressure, kind of can pull him this way so it's kind of almost like a third hand. So he's got it set up on the left here so he can pull himself in as he kind of comes up to this pinchy gas stone thing. Then for this one we can see, since he's kind of undercling this left hand, he can kind of pull himself into the wall and he can kind of extend off of it. It's really going to come to his feet and kind of pressing down through his feet. By pressing down through his feet, he's really going to be able to get the height to make this long reach. And without pushing with his feet, he would kind of just be stuck on the wall where he's at. And when he makes that move, he kind of brings himself from being more towards the right to letting his body shift to the left. So that way he's kind of hanging straight under more. Instead of having to kind of pull himself in, he can kind of just hang directly underneath that and let friction do its, and gravity do its job.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Here we have the climber sitting on the pad in the start position and this is a good look at this start foot for the left. It is quite good. It's not as good as the start hold for a foot and this is in a later sequence of the boulder but just noting that this left foot is quite good. The climber is then able to get up and right into this good pink jug. This is actually where the boulder seems to chill out for most climbers. And so we have the climber able to get out to this left hand here. They choose to not match it. Instead they switch their feet off of the blue foothold and dropping the knee in to the right and putting that right hip into the wall as well as locking off this left arm. Allows the climber to reach up high with the right arm and grab this hold with relative ease.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This one was not a good choice of the climber as he continued to apply a forceful pull up. This one, if the climber was going to do it again, would be to transfer over the left hand to the same block, potentially having to lay low in order to apply pressure, but continue to have that foot in placement. Once the climber had brought both of the hands into place, then he would be able to bring a high foot placement once lowering his center of gravity. However, there's different methods of each climber on applying the movement and body positioning to climb. So depending on what the next holds are next on the route, then it depends on the climber how they would like to design their foot placement. Here the climber is glancing down to make a foot switch. This one also to release the heel hook that's being in place. Releasing heel hooks can be tricky as heel hooks provide a lot of power. In this instance the climber applied the heel hook on the transition of the left hand going up twice. In releasing the heel hook the climber is going to bring the right toe to come into place at the hold. Once the climber applies pressure then he will be able to in control of release the heel hook from its placement. The climber brings the right foot to come into place at a foot chip down below and brings the left foot to come at a high stance to place the heel above the hold. When both of the limbs are in the same hold, this is called matching. So the climber is matching and applying pressure, counterintuitive, this one pressing the heel against the hold while pulling up on the same hold with the hand. Eventually the climber, once securing the pressure of the match, then the climber will bring the right foot to come into a wider stance, this one pushing down or letting the foot be as a flag and the climber then will be able to transfer most of the weight to the grip above while continuing to push down on the heel to release the left hand for the next placement. Here we can see how the climber chose to release the feet to make a foot placement freely but then has overcompensated the grips at this moment. The reason why the climber is forcing onto a pull up until he can control his weight onto the grips to then position the feet. As the climber has landed the right hand onto the block, the block is also with an edge that's aiming down. So it's not completely flat where the climber just gets to place the grip, but because it's flat at the top but it's also slanted down, it'll be difficult for the climber as he will need to create friction and apply the grip as an open hand. Now open hand grips the climber then will have to apply friction between the skin and the pores of the hold. The reason why the climber sends the hand as far in as possible into the wall when making the placement and applies the fingers above the hold and folds the hand with the palm coming to the side of the hold. As we can see he's folding the knuckles to make a closed grip. Once the climber applies weight onto the hold then he will know if his grip is catching on the hold. And it's important that the climber because is applying the grip onto the side of the hold, he keeps the elbow as close as possible to the wall while applying the grip until it sticks. Here the climber is making some hand gestures. This will help the climber to study from the ground the holds that he would be encountering and the way that he's supposed to hold them before going into the climb. The climber here has extended the left leg after making the foot switch. Keeping the leg extended, this is called flagging out, which helps the climber when making their reach up to the right. The flag helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the foot being in position. And being extended, the climber then is able to twist his body to keep his right side of the body towards the wall, which helps the climber to make a more direct reach of the right hand coming into place. Here we can see how the climber has brought the left hand into a pinch. This one the climber first has released it from the matching hold, his initial hold, came to make it into a placement to match where his right hand is and quickly moved over to the pinch hold. After the first move, the climber moving continuously to the next hold, this is called bumping. So the climber bumps over to get into a higher left hand placement. As we can see the type of hold the climber is holding onto is a pinch hold. So the climber is able to apply sufficient pressure on the squeeze by engaging that thumb onto the other side. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start. Once the climber gets to pick up the feet and place them onto a wall or against a wall and it's no longer in the mat, then the climb will start. Each hand grip, the climber is holding on to two different ones at different directions. The one being at the top for the right hand, the climber must apply pressure by weighing on the hold with the arm extended while holding on to a positive jug. This one because the climber is able to comfortably wrap the hand around the edge of the hold. And for the left hand, we can see how the climber has an undercling hold. This one is an upside down jug and the climber places the fingers behind the lip of the hold. And also we'll have to pull it towards the climber. As the climber pulls on both of the holds, he then will apply his weight onto the grips.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This is like a bit of an illusion. This is up, but pulling in really hard this direction. And it's a really, really tight compression. These holds are basically in line with each other. And so yeah, if you don't maintain the core tension and you can't keep the spin out from happening, it's going to be hard to maintain. Alright, so here is the start right hand down pull for the right start hold. Then we have this left heel foot match. And this climber is opting to use a heel where most climbers have opted to use a toe. People like different things. Some people like heel hooking and some people like toes. And so this climber decides to keep the right foot driving down on the foothold. A lot of climbers have chosen to do this move with the left foot on. I like this beta. I think it allows the climber to be more square because they're able to drive this left leg into the wall. I also think that it requires less pinch strength from the left hand, although the transition out of this position is quite difficult.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This helps the climber to keep a civility on his technique. This is because the climber is pushing down on the left foot and up with the toe with the right foot. These are a combination of two opposing forces at the feet and he must hide the core to stay on a stable position at the wall in order to execute the movement of the left hand over to the matching hold. This one being the dyno hold. It's typically seen also on overhangs which this is a difficult and very advanced footwork technique. It was clear that the climber, once dropping the weight, he was going to swing over to the right where his right hand placement was. So he extends the arm to place weight onto the grip and releases quickly the left hand since no longer the grip would be favorable for him. So both of the hands on the same hold is called a match. The climber secures a right foot placement and brings the knee inwards. This so that the climber is able to bring his right side close to the wall to obtain the last hold reach. As we can see underclings are usually powerful because the climber can place the hands from being under the hold to completely pass the hold and bringing the grip all the way down to his hips. So in this one the climber had to commit into a quick move of the hand up for the reach. Even if the climber was matching a jog hold, this one would be difficult to sustain once the climber releasing the foot from its place. This one because the climber will then cut feet and go out on a swing. So in this momentum, the climber engages on a forceful pull up, canvassing over to the hand going up to the next hold. This one is a positive hold as the climber is able to apply the fingers inside of the right side hole of the hold and the climber is able to place the fingers in the inside, able to curl the fingers inside, being another jog, the climber can catch on that lip of the hold and sustain the swing. The climber then was able to stick the move and is able to apply friction and gripping power onto the top hold. The climber quickly sends the left foot into a high placement, this one being the donut that is further away, placing the toe inside of the hold and now the climber must create pressure by placing the toe in the inside of the hole and push down. Here the climber lowers his center of gravity, this to keep the feet at a high position. So when the climber is ready to perform the dyno move, he then will push down on the feet, bring his chest close to the wall by engaging in a close pull up, and then he will jump by pushing down on the holds forcefully. When he is at mid-air, his right foot will be the last one being connected as well as the left hand. So it's important the climber right now secures the grips in the foot placement before committing into the dynamic move. The climber has lifted the right foot against the wall so now the climb has started and the climber brings the right hand to come into a match to the more positive hold. This one being a donut that is rounded in the inside and has a groove at the bottom. The climber can curl the fingers in both hands. The left hand is placed with the palm facing up against the hole so the climber must create pressure by pushing up on the hold while the other hold the climber is leaning on the hold in order to create pressure. The climber right now is performing a bicycle move but in two different holds. This means that while the left toe is pushing inside of the hold and away, the climber lifts the left foot to now make a toe hook onto the outer area of the other donut. This one placing the toe towards the bottom outside area of the hold as the climber continues to have the left hand on the inside area but top area of the hold. This the climber is continuing to rely on his right hand grip and must release the left hand carefully. Once the climber was able to land the hand onto the grip, he must continue to try to bring his core close to the wall, even if he happens to fall back to create pressure onto the grip. Since the climber had a secured right foot position, he was able to release the left hand to come into a match and the left toe, because it was extended from the push of him when making the reach, has come out of place. Now this one is out on the flag and the climber needs to sustain himself from the foot fully kicking out and pressing down on the right foot forcefully to sustain the move. Now if the climber can show a stability and control over matching the hands at the last grip, then the climb has been completed. When the climber raising the hips and bringing them close to the wall the climber then has transferred over the weight to the foot being in position the left one and quickly had transferred the left hand to come to match at the same rail Now both of the hands are on an undercling where the climber is now able to press onto the hold by pinching them and pushing the grip up As the climber sustains this hold it's important that the climber continues to keep the elbows close to the core As the climber needs to eventually gain height and get close to the wall Here he has performed a foot switch, placing the left foot to be surface with the lip of the hold, which later on he will engage to pull himself in and brings the right foot to the side of the hold. Both of the feet being in contact with the hold, the climber will have to, once bringing the hips close to the wall, he will then pull in with the right hand. This one by pinching on the hold to bring himself closer and engaging the elbow close to the core to release the left hand. The climber instead of doing a dyno because it's a hold at distance, the climber has thought about keeping his right foot to be boosted to push him forcefully on the stance but continues to keep the left hand on the donut. This the climber is able to reach the hold at distance and makes a placement of the hand to the right side of the hold. How the campus works is that the climber will engage into a swing down at the core. So the climber swings the hips for example onto the left side and this will release some of the gravity applied to the left hand. This one will be released and placed onto the top hold. This one for example comes into the rail and as soon as the climber makes a hand placement then the climber can drop the weight by swinging over automatically to the right. The climber is coming close to the wall to measure the distance of his apex, which is the distance of the arms extended, from the initial holds to the dino hold. Because the climber was matching the dine hold being a jug, it was important that the climber knows how to release the feet. If he was under the hold with the arms extended, he would definitely go out on the swing once releasing the foot from place. But on this one, the climber has engaged onto a pull up. This to tense the body to control the swing and instead, campus is over with the right hand to the next hold. This one being a positive hold since the climber is able to curl the fingers behind the edge of the hold and keeping the body stiff. The upper body can only make the climber keep the court tight to control dropping the feet in order to sustain the swing. Once the climber was able to apply the weight over the grips, the climber can release the foot being on the toe hook. This because the climber is adding sufficient force to sustain that foot placement. Here we can see how the climber has already started on the jump and all this will happen in a fraction of a second. As the climber lifts himself up, we can see how he engaged in a close pull up and brings the chest close to the wall. As soon as the climber gains sufficient height, he will then press down on the right foot once his center of gravity is over the right and the climber's right hand has been released. This so that the climber continues to look at the whole distance and must aim at the area where he would like to make the hand placement. Here the climber was able to make a right foot placement. This one being a high position is because the climber will eventually need to engage into a high step with making the next move. Reason why the climber has applied the right hand onto the top area of the hold while he continues to pull in with the left hand being in position. Since the climber was able to secure the grips, he's able to rely on them and leaning back, quickly sending the right foot into position onto the large hold. The climber is getting placed to the start holes. On this one, two hand holes start, where each hand has its own hold and they're both donuts. As we can see, the climber is crossing over the left hand over the right and keeping the right hand at distance. Once the climber is off the mat, then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

But he's able to keep both hands on, keep his foot on, and not have to dyno to it. So kind of a different sequence, different way to use the holds. So he kind of comes up with this cool alternate sequence. I'm starting with his hands crossed. He's got his left hand undercling this hold and his right hand established here. And he goes to match this. And what that's going to do is instead of allowing him to have him jump up this hold, he's going to kind of be able to create compression from this hold to this hold. And then kind of hang out here in the middle and keep tension the whole time and prevent himself from jumping. So by kind of utilizing this weakness in the holds, which is this kind of upper in-cut area, he's going to save himself from having to dino up the wall and instead just turn into a dynamic dead point. And then here he does this kind of unique move called a bicycle. So with his left foot, he's towing down. And with his right foot, he's towing up, kind of catching it. This movement is kind of equalizing on this plane. It's keeping his feet and lower body in position and really letting him use his core. He kind of utilizes this flick of the knee, drop knee type movement. So he brings this knee into the left, which kind of sucks his hips into the wall.

They are able to span this Section of the boulder and break the dyno which I actually think is really cool I had an idea that maybe this boulder could go static and it's cool to see someone do it that way Alright so here you have the climber doing an unusual start to this boulder.

And after matching up this target hold after the would-be dyno, the climber just kind of comes out. This is a really good hold. This is in a bunch of gyms all over the world. And yeah, double and cut jug, really, really friendly hold. And so after the touch of the further left start hold, the climber then ends up matched in this lower jug here, and they were able to get their right foot on the really big purple foot, which acts as sort of the launch foot on the dyno.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

However, when committing for the swing where he will get to be airborne, he needs to make sure that he pulls his chest close to the wall so that the hips will follow. And then in the moment, the climber will have to detach his hands, sending the right hand up. And then later on, once the center of gravity of the climber is over the right foot, then the climber can engage into a boost of that jump, pushing the foot once he is almost at mid-air, not having any contact. That way the climber can stay close to the wall and able to make a more secure landing of the right hand to the dyno hold. As the climber has secured the hands and the feet onto the holds, the climber is gaining momentum. This will help the climber when he needs to go up for the jump, he will then release himself going over to the right side and push hard on the feet as well as bringing himself close to the wall by engaging into a close pull up to bring the chest towards the wall. This will help the climber to then be during midair close to the wall when making the reach at the hold that he's going for the dyno. And it's important that the climber aims exactly at what area of the edge of the hold he would like to commit his hand to go up to for the placement. This is a step up start and we can see how the climber has placed the left foot first to bring then the right foot on top of the hold. This hold has a lot of surface so the climber can place half of the foot over the hold. As we can see the climber is no longer on the mat so the climb has started. Since the climber has brought himself to be airborne at the jump, the climber's only place of contact after it would be landing the right hand onto the hold. This is when the climber was able to bring the fingers to come into the edge of the hold. So it's important that the climber, once reaching the grip, he tries to keep his center of gravity under the hand placement. In this case, the climber was forced himself on the push away from the wall. So this will be a little bit difficult for him to sustain as he won't be able to sustain the grip by forcing the center of gravity under the hand. So he might go on to swing over here and potentially his right hand might peel off from the hold. Here, as the right foot was engaged, we can see the climber is no longer following the direction of his body close to the wall. And instead, he has engaged on the right foot prematurely, this throwing his center of gravity away from the wall. Now, as the climber continues to gain height, it's important that the climber, if feeling like detaching from the wall, he comes and slaps the hold in order to sustain the grip. The climbers movement of the arms is because the climber is using the fist to tap against the forearm. This will help release any tension that has been built up if the climber previously climbed it but also to release any tension and warm up the muscles before getting to climb. Here we can see how the climber has engaged into a forceful swing that brings his center of gravity being in the core to come close to the wall. This so that the climber when is in midair the climber continues in that direction and we can see how the left foot has come out of placement. This because the climber once shifts the weight over to the right side he will boost himself midair by pushing down on the right foot to make a forceful push for the climber to land the right hand up to the dino hold. Quickly after the climber has placed the feet onto the wall, we can see him swinging. This is so that the climber can build momentum when going up for the reach. We can see the next hole that the climber needs to go to is a hole that is a distance. So the climber must have to commit into a dyno. The climbers are starting at a two-hand hold start. This, each one of the holds being a donut, where the climber places the grips at the inside and at the bottom area of the donut. Now the climber is placing the fingers by curling them into the groove that dips in from the rounded hold and onto the left hand. It's flat so the climber will lay the fingers flat and there's a small edge that tucks in where the climber can place the fingertips. Now the climber places the thumbs on the outside of the hold to gain a better grip.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It's obvious that the climber feels a little uncomfortable in this space. They started to initiate the swing and then killed their momentum and here they are starting that swing again. It's really good to sort of exert all the power that you have when getting on the wall and these sorts of points of indecision take away from the available power that we have. So especially with one of these dino moves, it's good to get on the wall, do that one pump and then just jump as hard as you can.

The climber is placing both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching because the climber places both of the hands in the same hold. And in this one the climber will be placing the hands inside of the hold and curling the fingers to hold on to the edge. Once the climber applies the hands into position, then she will be able to weight on the grip by lowering her center of gravity. Now the climb will start until the climber gets to apply the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing on the mat. The climber wasn't able to sustain the hand grip. This one was an open hand and the climber had placed the palm to go onto the right side flat area of the hold. This one is slightly slanted downwards so the climber's grip is slighted out due to an effective amount of pressure. Also the climber lost the foot placement and this one could have compromised the climber from controlling to adjust the pressure on the grip. If the climber was going to do this again, it's important that she keeps the foot in place so that once the climber holds on to the grip, she is able to have time to apply that friction that is needed when closing the grip to sustain the hold. The climber has started to climb, places both of the feet at a high stance and spread out. Soon the climber will have to make the move up to the next hold. This one we can see how the climber plans to bring the left hand up to the hold. This one because the climber has brought the left knee to come inwards so that the climber's left side stays towards the wall when going up for the reach.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The right foot has come out of place this one because the climber transferred over the weight to the highest foot being in place. Now the climber has three points of contact so this is fine but it's important that the climber continues to apply pressure in all of the grips especially on the right hand. This is a sloper so the climber is sustaining it with an open hand since she made the placement. The slopers are held by creating friction of the skin towards the pores of the hold and must create an open hand or close hand with closing the fingers in order to cup it and create pressure at the fingertips. Now it's important that the climber once has the skin catch with the hold and the climber will pull down on the elbow to maintain that pressure. The elbow needs to stay leaning right underneath the hold and towards the wall to secure the grip. again the climber has bumped from matching the sloped jug to press down hard onto the left foot and pull down on to that jug to make the left hand coming up to the move. So the climber first made a move then bumped over to the highest hold. This one because she's doing all of the move continuously. The right leg being extended this is called flagging out and the climber is using this to transfer over the weight to the foot being in place as well as keeping her in balance when having to engage the core and the hips which are the center of gravity to come into the wall. This helps the climber with having direction and also because the climber is going into a higher stance she's bringing the right foot to go over to the left to help the climber to create more pressure onto that left foot placement. Here the climber had released the left hand to bring the left hand over to the right side. This one being a jug, this is a promising hold so that the climber will be able to make the hand placement. But here the climber needs to go over to the right side when making the move. So the climber brings the left foot to bring it into place into a hold that is slanted with the opening into the side. At this time the climber places the foot to go into the wall and uses the inner area of the toe box to press against the lip of the hold. This is the climber will have to continuously create pressure by bringing the knee inwards and try to bring her center of gravity to be weighting the hold by continuing to press on that knee coming inwards as she is making the move. The climber was able to move her right hand to come into a match at the hold. This one is positioned with a pinch where she presses the thumb, closes the grip and the fingers are on the other side. This is not a very sustainable type of grip so the climber must move out of this grip fast if she gets the chance since she has already positioned herself down below for the next move. Right foot being in place is the one that is going to help her once pushing down on the hold to gain height. The leg being extended, this is called flagging out and will help the climber to have balance and stability over the stance. Also to transfer over the weight to the foot being in place. Once the climber gains height, the leg extended, once she pushes the left foot down against the wall, then she will be able to go out for the direction that she needs to go and helps also to keep the climber's right side towards the wall when making the reach. Here the climber had engaged into a close pull up to send the left hand up to the next hold. This one is a jug because the climber is able to fold the fingers behind the hold. Now, this one the climber must pull on to the direction to the right side due to the placement being on to the left of the hold. As the climber was going up, we can see how she is keeping her left side close to the wall. This is because the climber has pivoted her left toe to bring her knee inwards so that she is keeping her left side. And also, helped by the right foot being high in place by pushing down, brings also the hips of the climber close to the wall, pushing in the direction where she needed to. Here we can see the climber actually had pressed the left toe towards the edge of the hold, making the pressure going inwards. And then the right foot, the climber has a slightly a bigger lip for that right foot but also the inner area of the foot is also pressing inwards. This will create a compression between the two of the feet so that the climber was able to sustain her moves and needed to be applied continuously. As the climber made the left hand placement to the jug, this one being a secure grip, then she just needed to press down onto that right foot, no longer pressing in and instead continuing to press the left toe into the hold. As we can see the climber continuously leans back and keeping the hips close to the wall so that she's able to then bring her movement to follow as she will create the farther she makes the moves to the right, the more pressure she will be able to create with the toe naturally without having to engage the knee as much, which will make it easy eventually for the climber to The climbers were positioning her feet, this one to come into a high placement. First she sent the left leg that was extended on a flag to be placed at the top of the hold, and soon the climber sends the right foot to bring it over onto a match as well. Again, now that the climber has secured the grips, we can see how it's important that the climber glances down at the feet. This time, the climber needs to bring the foot that was out of reach, being the flag, to come onto a new foot placement, being at a high placement. This time, the climber will have to move up the wall. This is when the climber sends the left foot to come across into a positive grip. This is the green one's start hold. And once the climber applies pressure to that one, then she will be able to release the lower foot. The climbers is starting at a one hold start. Both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching. And the climbers placing the hands onto the right side of the hold. This is for the climber to create pressure and transfer over the weight to the hands. Once on the wall, the climber must lay back to the left side. And the climber must bring the feet off the mat. Once the climbers feet are off the mat and on the wall, then the climb will start. Here, this is the climbers last hold. This is a horn so the climber is able to wrap the hands at the top of the hold. The climber must show a civility and control of the move while sustaining on the match. If the climber is able to demonstrate this, then the climb is completed. As we can see the climber needed to free up the left hand Bringing it from the jug to come and join at the sloper. So it's important that the climber is pushing down on that toe as we can see is placed above the hold and Continues to apply pressure on that sloper also pulling down That way the climber was able to free up the hand and is coming into this is sloped hold This is a jug is sloped hold meaning that there is no sharp edge, but the climber needs to create like a hooking motion of keeping the fingertips close together and Create pressure at the fingertips Placing them all the way in in order to cup the hand The climber makes the reach of the right hand come into place into a jug, this one being a positive hold since the climber is able to wrap their hand behind the hold. This movement of the climber being on the same stance and moving her right hand from down below to come to a match and over to the top. The last move, this is called bumping because the climber was not ideally staying onto that same hold and there was no foot movement, so the climber made a move and then bumped. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet. On this one, the climber is able to trust the grips and leans on the holds that she's sustaining. During this time, the climber is important that she glances down at the feet and needs to continue to apply pressure at the feet during the switch. So she brings the right toe to come into place where the foot hold is and as soon as she applies that pressure then she will be able to release the left foot from its place. As the climber is sustaining the first move, this one being the start move, the climber we can see how it's placing the hands onto the one side and keeps the left foot placed lower while the right foot is placed higher. This one because the climber is pressing more onto the right foot so that she's able to lean over to the left side while sustaining the grip. Also, soon the climber will go up for the next move. This one the climber will have to rely on the high foot to press down so that she's able to go up for the direction that she needs to go.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So right off the bat, she's kind of getting this straight arm position so she's not kind of pulling herself out of position or trying to pull herself up to make make herself feel better on the holds. She's keeping her arms nice and straight but tension and really sinking down into her feet so she can really drive up. You can see she's kind of got her feet staggered like this. It already looks like she's turning one of her knees out and in to maybe kind of twist in and kind of do a twist lock technique. So here we can see she does a good job of when she gets this hole You know, she wants to be as perpendicular to it, but she's coming from you know, kind of over in this position So she does a really good job of when she hits it kind of sinking underneath it So we should kind of have a pose it and keep moving up the wall Here she does a foot swap on this hold. But if she wanted to, she could just put her left hand on, left foot, to the back leg. So that way when she brings her right hand up, all she's going to do is bring the back leg out to just a regular flag.

This one was the only foot being in contact with the wall. So in this case, the climber is already at the ground. The climber was able to make the right hand placement above the hold. This climber curls the fingers at the edge in order to sustain the grip to perform a closed grip with the fingers catching on the edge. This one is flat at the top and so the climber places the palm on it and in order to create pressure, the climber must find a way to create friction between the skin and the hold. This one, once the climber has that catch with the open hand and curled fingers in the climber, will be able to weight her grip. The climber is starting at a one-hold start. This one the climber placing both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching and as we can see the climber is trying to reposition the hands in a way that would make sense for her when coming out of the first move. Now the climber will start the climb once her feet are no longer in the ground and are on the wall. Then the climb will start. In this case the climber's next hold is this pink one that's above her. So in this one the climber will want to make the position that would make sense for her body movement when going up for the reach. If the climber was going to attempt this climb again, it's important that the climber continues to apply pressure at that right foot when making the reach. And the body positioning was right as the right side is ideal for the climber to keep when making the reach. In this case, the climber previously had both of the feet into the same hold when making the reach out of the start. And ideally, if the climber had already positioned herself with the left leg being extended on the flag for committing both of the moves to then bump up, that would take less energy for the climber and potentially being able to continue the climb. Here, the climber had glanced over down at the feet to release the left foot from its place where it was matching before with the right foot. And releasing the foot, this is called flagging out, so the left leg will be extended while she will be continuing to apply pressure onto the foot being in place, being the right one. Now the climber will have to engage into a close pull up while maintaining the right hand grip. She has brought the grip to come slightly over to the corner of the hold in this case, or potentially has it slided out when she was making, readjusting the foot placement. And this one, the climber, we can see how she is engaging into a pull up, which will have to be the next move as she's making the right hand up to the next hold. The climber readjusted her grips, this one no longer crossing over. The climber then is about to make the move up to the next hold. The climb hasn't started because the climber no longer is standing in the mat and have brought the feet up bringing the right foot into placement with the knee coming inwards.

However, the climber had sent the hand extended and then wanting to grip onto the hold by placing the hand, the climber completely misses the entry of the placement. So dynamic moves need to be done quickly as soon as she had made the reach to land the hand. However, the climber had completely missed the hold and had gone over it. So now the climber will retract and come off the wall due to being a dynamic stance, it will be really hard for the climber that when extending completely for the reach, she will be able to go back to the placements where she was before. The climber has sent the right hand to the same hold. This one coming to a match is sustaining to that thicker area of the hold where the climber will have to apply the grip open-handed as it has more surface than any end cuts and so the climber will have to create friction between the skin and the pores of the hold and once she gets into a catch of sustaining the grip then she will have to continue to apply that weight eventually by leaning back or forcing pressure on a slight pull up to keep the elbow bended to transfer the weight of the climber onto the grip. Now the left foot has come into place this one brings the climber brings the toe on top of the surface of the area and then and then it starts sending down the heel in order to place more of the surface of the foot towards the hold. It's important that when the climber is transferring the weight over that left foot being in place the climber always needs to continue to slightly bend the leg in order to sustain the pressure on the hold. This is called smearing. The climber is able to send the left hand up. This one places it with the fingers going as far in and wrapping around the hold. This one being a thick handle so the climber at once is able to squeeze the hold even if the wrist is also being placed on top of the hold it just creates more surface for the climber to create friction and once is able to secure the grip then the climber leans back on it. As we can see the climber was able to gain height to make up the reach by sending up on both of the feet being in place and the climber continued to sustain onto that under grip with the palm pulling it close to the core. As the climber was gaining height the right hand placement can come as low as her waist. The climber here has gone for up for a reach, this one being dynamic, where the climber has stood up over the right foot that's placed on a flat surface, continuing to smear by pressing away and then pressing down in order to create friction between the rubber and the hold. As we can see, the climber also had brought the knee to come inwards for that right foot, so the climber is able to keep the right side close to the wall to bring her center of gravity close to the wall. As well, as we can see, while making that stance, the climber kept the left leg extended. This is called flagging out, so it helps the climber to have stability over the reach and also to transfer over the weight to the foot being in place while maintaining balance. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet when making the foot placement. The climber does this because it's sending the right foot coming over to the left side of the hold. This one, where the hold drops over to the left side. Being slightly flat, the climber will create pressure on the foot placement onto the hold by pressing down and also away from the hold. This one being onto the right with the right foot. The climber then will have to continue to have the position with bringing the knee inwards when making the stance. However, the climber will have to apply friction with the hold and the sole of the rubber of the foot. So, this one by smearing. So, the climber will have to continue to keep the leg slightly bended in order to sustain the smear when gaining height. The climbers is starting at a one hold start. This one when both of the hands are placed into the same hold this is called matching. Now the climber is placing the fingers behind the edge of the hold. This one being in both of the sides think of an under jug right with an entry where the fingers can slide behind it and so in order for the climber to pull it you will have to lean back to create pressure on the grips and pull on the hold with the elbows pulling towards the core. Now the climb will start until the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing on the mat. The climber was able to send the right hand up to the next grip. She's holding to the top area of that hold, which puts her closer on her sequence. And also holding on to the top of the hold helps the climber to bring into an open grip and to sustain it on the direction that the climber is coming from. Now, we can see how the climber's right side is placed towards the wall. It also helps the reach. And the climber does this by bringing the right knee to come inwards, which is the one where the climber had made the flip position, and has kept the left leg to be extended. This is called flagging out. Flagging out helps the climber to gain a stability and balance over the move. As we can see, the leg extended helps the climber with supporting on the twist of her body going out to the right side, and brings her center of gravity close to the wall, this one being the right. As we can see on this view, the climber's right hand has continued to be applied onto the grip previously having to be placed in front of her and having the fingers wrapped around the lip pulling the elbows towards the core and as the climber had gained height to go up for the next reach we can see how the undercling can still be positioned as low as her waist height. Now the climber must work on bringing either the right hand up for the next hold to be her next move and later on to bring her feet at a higher position to continue the climb. Here the climber has placed both of the feet onto the wall and quickly raises the hips. This is because the climber is transferring over the weight to the feet being in place and the climber is sustaining with both of the grips by bringing the elbows close to the core in order to sustain the hold. As we can see the climber is also placing the thumb on the outside of the undercling. Undercling is the way that the climber plays the fingers from being from underneath to pinch the grip and the thumb can help the climber on giving extra power onto that grip to pinch the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She's not fighting these things, so this hold looks kind of big, but also kind of slopey. You can see her palms kind of flat against it, so she's not really digging her fingers. You'll notice she makes this move and then keeps her arm relatively straight, so she's not kind of pulling herself off the hold or driving her tension away from her feet. And then here she kind of gets up to the dead point. She's got left hand on, right foot on, so she's nice opposite pose. Got this left foot plaguing out. And it looks like she just barely misses it. So she looks like she did everything correct. Really drove up, but just kind of was inaccurate and missed the hold. So that's where twisting in further, really twist locking in. So bringing that right hip straight into the wall can kind of help you move a little slower.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I believe this foot is on as well, but the climber did not use it. And they were able to somewhat strenuously get out to this right hand here, which is another sort of interesting sloper jug situation. Alright, so here we have this double undercling start. You'll notice the activity with the pinch here, with the thumb. So not only is this a proper undercling, but you're also pinching both sides on top here, so a lot of good control from here. Also notice the bend in the elbows. This is really highlighting the biceps. The climber attempts to bump up right hand to something up here And just comes up a bit short, I think that maybe the beta I think that I think this is the right beta I think they just missed so Indecision can do that to climbers. I don't know what to do, but I'm gonna try this and Targeting becomes difficult in this situation Climber then goes left hand up to this hold, which looks kind of like a sloping, like a sloper jug hybrid. And the climber chooses to keep the feet low, forcing tension through the feet in order to get this match, rather than bringing the feet up high before the match.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

In this case, especially when doing a foot switch, the climber had originally placed the right foot by placing the toe on the small foot hold. Now the climber needs to bring the left toe to come into place above that foot chip. In this one, the climber has to continuously apply pressure on the feet. This one, once the climber releases the right foot from its place, the climber will immediately press down on the toe to make the foot placement. Once the climber was able to adjust their right hand placement, the climber then drops the weight onto that grip. This is because the climber is now releasing the feet off from the wall. This is called cutting feet and the climber has done it intentionally because it's rotating her hips to bring the left foot to come into a high placement in front of her. The climber was able to bring the right hand up to a second move, this one being continuous from the match placement where the left hand is. She had moved into a side pull jug and then on the same foot placement but this one adjusting the leg to come inwards. The climber then makes a stance to once more gain height, pulling herself closer to bring the hand up to a higher place. It's important that the climber keeps the center of gravity close to the wall which is on the hips where it was aided by the rotation of the knee coming inwards so the climber was able to keep the right side towards the wall bringing the center of gravity with it when on the reach. The climber then has switched her feet, this one sending the right foot where the left foot was and has extended the left leg to come into place into a farther hold. Now the climber brings the knee inwards. This tells me that the climber needs to keep further reach the right side towards the wall. So the right hand is the one coming off in placement. And this will be important because the twist of her body going to the right side will be helped by the leg being extended and the knee being inwards when making the stance and the reach over. Now that the climber was able to apply sufficient pressure on the top grip, this one having control over stabilizing the move, the climber then cuts feet, meaning keeps both of the feet off the wall just so that the climber is able to shift her waist over to the right side by twisting on the body sustaining the grips just so that the climber is able to make a high foot placement over to the right side. As we can see the climber when going out for the throw of the right hand over to the next hold the climber has first lowered the center of gravity and then pushed away from the wall to then swing back inwards in order to make the right hand placement onto the wall. This is just a slight body movement that the climber had done in control of the right foot being in place pushing her away from the wall and then when swinging back into the wall then was trying to go for the hand placement to ideally be at the top of the hold. The climber wasn't successful at making that reach reason why the climber's hand is retracting in this moment. It's important that the climber whenever making a move glances down at the feet when making a new foot placement. In this one the climber has brought the left foot to come into place to a hold that has a ledge that sticks out. This making a positive hold when making the foot placement and is bringing the right foot to come into place as well. This one then the climber will be matching the hold or potentially doing a foot switch in this moment. Once the climber is able to apply pressure with any of the feet the climber can bring the right hand to come out of placement. This one because now the hold will be too low for her. During this transition the climber had engaged in the core and pick up the feet so that the climber was able to One bring the feet in front of her instead of continuing to be away of the closest The higher grip being in place so the climber brings the right toe to come into place into a foothold This one is a small to the climber applies the toe and the climber eventually Will have to bring the left foot into the wall When the climber made the reach of the right hand up to the jug, was able to place the fingers behind the edge of the hold, this making it a positive grip to hold on to. As the climber drops the weight onto the grip, the climber is also trying to sustain the swing of the left foot coming off the wall. Notice as her weight is dropping in the middle once placing weight onto the top grip. It's important that the climber, when making such a dynamic reach, is to try to push the right foot being in place, even if the leg is extended, by pedaling, pressing on the toe down to sustain that move. In this case, the climber didn't lose the foot placement even with the dynamic move, which tells me that it's good as the climber is conscious of continuing to apply pressure on the foot and not totally rely on dropping the weight over the top grip. The climber now brings both of the hands to come into a match at the horn, this one being the last hold. The climber must demonstrate a civility over sustaining the move and control when sustaining the hold as well. If the climber is able to demonstrate this in the climb, it's done. The climber was able to bring the right hand out of the match into a hold in front of her, being a side jug. And the climber then brings the knee inwards of the right foot to then extend her stance while pulling herself in, keeping the hips close to the wall to send the right hand up. The bent knee helps the climber to keep her right side towards the wall to bring her center of gravity with it when making the stance. The climber took some time to make the right foot placement, almost missing the hold but quickly recovering from it and sensed later the left hand that was underneath that pinch hold that she had that was a jug to bring it over to a match where the right hand is. Here the climber continued to keep the arms extended and then pushes down on the right foot to gain height. And for the climber to gain direction up for the reach is because of the left leg being extended on the flag. The climber has pressed the toe against the wall to sustain the throw of her move going out right and then stay in position while she was gaining height, pressing down on the right foot by extending the leg. Now because this is a dynamic move in that reach, the climber will potentially be able to apply pressure once closing the grip and securing that move. Then the weight will be transferred over to the hands being in place, potentially losing contact with the wall at the feet. As we can see the climber brings the left toe to come into place in the same hold where her left hand is. This is called matching because both of the limbs are in the same hold so the climber right now is pushing towards the hole and then pressing down in order to smear on the hold for the rubber to catch onto the pores of the hold while the climber continues to pull onto the grip in order to apply pressure. This one the pressure is pushing into opposite ways securing the hand grip and the foot placement. The climber is starting at a one hold start. As we can see the climber is holding with both of the hands coming in an undercling, meaning that the climber is able to wrap the hands the same way as she would on a jug being on the edge of the hold, placing the fingers in the inside, closing the grip and then pulling the elbows towards the core in order to sustain the hold. Now the climb will start until the climber gets to place both of the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing on the mat. The climber was able to send the right hand up for a reach. This one, being open-handed, is not a sloper, as the climber is able to place the fingertips to be curled in at an edge, and then creating a lip for the hold to sustain. Once the climber adjusts the grip, which she does by looking away to gain some inches at the reach, for the climber to then adjust the grip for securing the hand placement. As we can see, when the climber made the reach, we can see how the climber was able to continue the pressure on the foot. This was done well as the climber controlled placing the hand and weighing it off, but not completely applying so much pressure that the climber would lose pressure down at the foot. The climber here places both of the hands in the same hold, this one matching and this one the climber is able to wrap the hands on the sides of the hold and bring thumbs in front, which helps the climber to squeeze the hold to secure the grip. Here the climber has sent the right foot to come into placement and now the climber is in a wider stance. The next hold for the climber will be one at reach where the climber will then have to pull herself in order to stand up on the feet. The climber is struggling with making the right hand placement onto the next hold. So this is when the climber brings it back into position in the match. Now the climber is glancing over at the top going for potentially a hold that is at distance. So the climber here is keeping the arms extended once placing the grips and brings her center of gravity low. This is potentially because the climber is preparing for a dynamic move as she will then would have to transfer the weight over to the feet and gain a swing where she extends her arms in order to benefit from the swing to go up to the next hold. The climber when engaging in the core and curling the tail into the wall, the climber was able to bring the feet higher. This one is a need that the climber makes a high foot placement as it will help her with making the stance on the next move. The climber in bringing the feet higher, the climber was able to place then the toe over inside of the groove of the hold that she's matching at this moment which secures the foot placement rather than smearing as she did originally. Now she's glancing over to the right side to make the right foot placement. Here we can see how the climber had sent the right hand from the undercling to come into a match at the handle hold. The right hand placement is placed on the thicker area of the hold so the climber keeps the grip open handed. Then we'd have to apply friction between the skin and the hold. Once the climber has met that catch of the friction, the climber will have to continue to keep the elbow close to the wall in order to create pressure on the grip. As we can see the climber has extended the left leg, this one to transfer over the center of gravity to the foot being in place, being the right one. The climber brings the knee inwards to keep her right side close to the wall as the climber will be going up with the right hand. As the climber had placed the feet onto the wall, the climber was able to raise the hips to come towards the wall to transfer the weight over to the feet. The climber, once pressing down on the feet, the climber was able to stand up to gain height to make the left hand placement onto the handle hold. As we can see, the climber has brought the fingers to come all the way in to the hold and wrap around the handle. As we can see, the climber, once creating friction between the grip and the hold, then the climber will be able to place the weight to sustain the grip and giving it pressure while hooking the hand on top of it. Now, the climber was able to gain height and get herself close to the wall, due to the right hand continuing to be on an undercling. This is a powerful placement because at first, it was in front of her before getting onto the wall. And once placing the feet and raising the hips, the climber's gaining height can be sustained all the way down past her hips.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So now she's a right hand, left foot. But she's about to match this hold and then move right hand up again. So what she could do is just stay right hand, right foot, do a back leg, match this, bring this foot back over to the left leg out that way. And it would just save her from having to do a foot move. Not that it looks like it really taggers her out or anything, but it could save a little bit of energy. Here you can see her starting to do that twist lock technique. With her left arm nice and straight, she's in a nice balanced position. She flicks that left foot out, it smears into the wall, so she's able to force through that toe right there. That should drive her out to the right. Then she can sit on this right foot, and she twists into the wall. That lets her casually reach over. Instead of pulling, she can keep that arm straight and lean over to the side and push with her feet. You can see she's taking her time. It takes a little bit of an effort to put her right foot on. But she waits to make the move until she gets that right foot on. So she can control the movement with a drive down with the feet. So you can see she's kind of leaning back, keeping her arms nice and straight but still tensioned. So she's not kind of pulling herself in, wasting that arm energy trying to get herself in a better position or fighting the position. And this kind of lets her sink back and really kind of drive down into the feed. You can see this twist lock technique, so she gets opposite pose. She's right foot, left hand, and twist her torso into the wall, bring that right hip in to the wall, play left foot out, kind of keeping tension and rigidity against the wall, pushing down into it. And with that, she's able to kind of spring up, again pivot around this left arm, and make these long reaches up. And then actually, she decides to not go for this hold even though she was touching it. It looks like it's maybe a little bit slope here. But she's in such a good position, she's able to kind of spring up from that right foot and hit this big kind of juggy pinch thing up here. And you can see just how much tension she's keeping. So she was able to really do that whole move by just standing up onto that hold instead of having to pull with her arms. And her left arm is still relatively, it's tension but still relatively straight. So she's kind of really pivoting around and kind of moving around that point. You can see that she does a good job of looking down at her feet as she moves them. Here she has both feet on the same hole so she probably could drop one. Kind of twist more into the wall. So she dropped the left foot. The left foot could kind of flag out and she could kind of twist over this right foot and bring her whole right hip into the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

They are able to bust up right into this down pulling hold here. So pretty similar move to the move off of the handlebar, they're just a little higher on the wall and using a slightly different hold. So here we have this start hold here, this big nose, double undercling start. And the climber goes up left and I actually notice that this is a full-on handlebar. So this is a pretty good hold. And after doing some more moves on jugs, the climber is able to get to the finish hold for the top. So here we have the climber just wrapping inside of this handlebar and kind of fiddling with this hold here and ultimately deciding to just go all the way into this nice jug pinch here while driving off of this nice pedestal foot.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

It also matters that the climber might have changed the way of approaching the hold by crossing the hands, and it was not efficient when making the reach, keeping her away from the wall. As you can see, when she was going up for the reach, her knee was pointed outwards on that foot that was being in place, and instead, bringing the knee inwards or changing the body positioning would have helped the climber to achieve the grip. Here we can see the climber starting at a one hold start. This the climber will have to place both of the hands into the same hold, this is called matching and as we can see she's crossing over the right hand and this one the climber then will have to engage into a close pull up by forcing the elbows out in order to bring herself close to the wall. The climber has to start at the climb because it's no longer on the mat and is pressing down at the feet being in place to raise the hips. Once the climber gets to raise the hips enough to be close to the wall then the climber will be able to move the hand up to the next hold. The climbers is starting at a sit start. Sit starts are known to add a grade to the climb because the climber will have to place the limbs onto the wall. And then once raising the hips towards the wall and off the ground, then the climb will start shifting over the weight to the limbs being in place. When the climber was going up for the reach, we can see how the climber's left foot had come off placement. This one due to a lack of pressure when making the pull up to send the left hand up. As the climber was raising the hips, this one because the climber is pressing down on the left foot, the only one being in position at this time. We can see how the right foot is still on the mat. This is dabbing, it's a term in bouldering for accidentally touching the ground or the crash pad while trying to ascend the route. So in this one, it might have been ideal if the climber had made a right foot placement before raising the hips so that she had started the bouldering problem correctly.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So it looks like as she moves up to this first hold She's doing most of the pulling her body and it doesn't look like her feet and hips are in a good position So it looks like her feet are made to sit on there as she pulls herself up She kind of just pulls the tension off her feet because her feet quickly pop off and she falls off the wall. So I think By kind of giving a twist lock technique too so she could kind of twist this Left knee in or a twist up into her forearm and bicep Leg this right foot out further.

This so that the climber performed a slight swing so that she was able to make a dynamic move up to the reach. This one being a hold where the climber can wrap the hand, this is a positive hold being a jug so it can be promising for the climber when making the reach. As we can see the climber is sustaining in position by continuing to press down at the feet but the left foot is the one extended and the toe instead is pressing against the wall. This one keeps the climber to transfer the weight over to the highest foot as well as keeping in position when making the reach and having direction. The climber had dropped the left foot and this one being extended to be a flag meaning like a tail so that the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the foot being in position being the right. As the climber drops the weight onto the grip being the right hand being in place inside of the pocket. This one has an edge and the climber can curl the fingers inside of the hold which means that the climber can pull on it to apply weight. Quickly sends the left hand to come into position at the same hold but this time is holding on to the top lip of the hold. The climber must demonstrate a civility and control over sustaining the match which is the last hold. Once the climber can demonstrate that then the climb is completed. The climber brings the left hand to come into a match, this one being a positive hold because it's a jug. Now the climber yet has not made the right foot placement, so it's important that the climber makes that placement before moving on to the next hold. The climber is performing a layback while sustaining the grips above. This one's her bow jug so the climber is able to trust onto the hand grip and ideally not engage the arms during this process. This is called a layback where the climber throws her body over to the side to give pressure and sustained by the layback is because the climber's feet are over to the right side which are at distance. So it's important that the climber while extending the arms continues to raise the hip towards the wall to transfer the weight to the feet. The climbers left foot is not on the wall and this is taking some time as she's trying to make a foot placement. This if the climber is engaging on the arm can tire the arm during this process so the climber is glancing over to the right side to potentially move up her right hand to a next placement. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet when making a foot switch. In this case, the climber's right foot is taking over the foot chip size, so the climber brings the left toe to be placed above the right foot. This one, the climber will then have to continue to apply pressure to not lose the foot placement, so the climber, as soon as it releases the right foot from its place, the climber's left toe will be pushed down directly onto the hold in order to secure the placement. The climber had spent some time trying to locate the feet for a high foot placement and was about to go for the next move, realizing after making the engagement of the move that her feet were still positioned low. So once again had looked down to make a high foot placement which she now has achieved. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet when making the foot placement. In this case, the climber is bringing both of the feet into a match. The climber's body position and move for this technique when making the reach is that the climber had brought the right knee to come inwards and then as the climber was gaining height by stepping over on the left foot, the climber is bringing the knee in and now bringing the knee down. This is called the knee drop. This can be a bit strenuous for the knee as the climber is using this in the same ability that the flag would be and knee drops can act as flags only when there is overhang walls. So what the knee drop does is that it helps the climber to keep the right side of the climber towards the wall which helps bring the center of gravity close to the wall as the climber is making the stance. It also can transfer over the weight to the left foot that is helping the climber gain height. Once the climber has placed the right hand and secures the grip, then he can release the knee drop. The climber is starting at a one-hold start, this one being a jug so the climber is able to wrap the hands around the lip of the hold in order to sustain the grip once closing it. Now the climber must place the feet onto the wall and off the mat, then the climb will start. As we can see, once the climber had made the right foot placement, she brings the knee to come inwards. This helps the climber to make a smooth transition due to keeping her right side of the body close to the wall when making the reach. This is her last hold and as we can see the climber is applying all of the fingers to come inside of the pocket inside of the hold. It's important that the climber continues to look down at the feet whenever making a foot switch. In this one, the climber brings the left toe to come and meet at the hole, and then after that, the climber will be able to release the right foot from its place. Once the climber had sent her right hand to come into placement into a jug, she's now sustaining into two jugs and soon drops the weight to send pressure onto the grips. Loses pressure down at the right foot or she, in purpose, released the foot in order to replace her feet for having a better movement onto the next sequence. So when both of the feet are not onto the wall, this is called in feet. So the climber will go out into a swing and when the climber can, she will then engage onto the core and bring the foot that she would ideally want to have onto the wall to come into place once coming back from the swing. The climber after making the left foot placement we can see how she has brought her knee coming inwards and extended the right leg. This helps the climber when performing the stance to make the reach up to the next hold. This one because the climber needs to keep the body being the left side towards the wall making the reach as it will make it easy for the climber to sustain her center of gravity. This one the left right leg being extended this is called flagging out which helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the foot being in place and the knee coming inwards keeps the climbers left side towards the wall which helps the climber when going up for the reach to bring her center of gravity with it. The climber had committed into a close pull up to send the hand that was first on the match to go up to the next hold. It matches when both of the hands are in the same hold. Sending the right hand to another jug, the climber manages her center of gravity by bringing the right knee to come inwards as the climber performed the reach.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Instead of just pressing, she's kind of able to pull down with her feet. And that's going to let her keep both her feet on, and really balance out and kind of twist into the wall. Here you can see she makes kind of a big dead point. So she's able to drive, you know, holding on with that right arm. She's got to twist in a little bit, has the left foot on, so she's opposite pose. And is able to stick that right foot out for balance. So right from the get-go does a pretty good job starting from a nice position. So it keeps her arms straight and kind of lets her body drop so that she can sag into the wall. So, I mean, it's here, she gets this high foot, and then she's able to kind of press and tension into this left foot, really drive down this way. That's going to kind of drive her up the wall. So, instead of having to move completely with her arms, she'll be able to push with that bottom left foot, really get a lot of tension pushing to the right. Here she's kind of losing a little bit of tension, so she's letting this left foot kind of just stick up from the wall. You can see it's kind of bringing her whole body out and away from the wall. She's opposite pose though, so she's left hand on right foot, but by not balancing this foot, that's gonna cause her to kind of tension and kind of pull back in against this swing out.

Locking down this left arm, we see the climber able to reach up and right. So this is a very similar move to the start move, and a mirror of the second. Here we have the climber match down pulling on this jug here. Little right knee drop in, bringing these hips into the wall and transferring the weight into this left arm in order to free up the right to make a move. And after bringing the left hand into this intermediate or hold that was very close to the right hand, doing a little bit of footwork, the climber was able to find this high right foot and they were able to go square. So this right leg is out to the right, driving him with the left leg here. Similar lock off with the left arm that then frees the right arm to go into this orange jug. So, the climber was able to get right hand into this hold, hand swishing the feet around, and using this driving foot, the climber was able to get a left drop knee in, which is a shift of the hips, and they're able to lock this right hand down and move the left hand up into this hold.

The climber was able to bring the left hand out of the match to bring it up to the next move. As we can see the climber sends the hand open-handed and almost as hooking onto the corner of the hold. In this case the climber had gained height by pressing on both of the feet and the left knee being folded inwards helps the climber to keep her left side towards the wall to aid the reach. As the climber stood up forcefully to make the reach her right foot has come out of placement. This could overcompensate the grips if the climber has not been able to secure the hand at reach to completely apply friction to that grip. The climbers is starting at a one-hold start. As we can see, both of the hands are placed into the same hold, and this one is located as a jug where the climber can wrap the hands around the lip of the hold. Once the climber squeezes the hold, then she's able to then lean back by extending the arms in order to rely on the grips. Now, the climber will be able to bring the feet into position, and once the climber positions the feet into the wall, then the climb will start. The climber was able to sustain the grips, but in this case the climber's center of gravity was thrown off so the left foot had come out of place, ending the climb. As we can see the climber is placing both of the hands into the same hole. This is called matching. And now that the climber is able to place the feet onto the wall, she's able to then press down on the feet to raise the hips off the mat.

Now for the climber to continue to apply that pressure that is needed, the climber brings herself into a slight pull up bending the arms and it's necessary that the climber keeps the elbows close to the wall when sustaining this hold. Here we can see the climber lowering her center of gravity after making the right foot placement. In this one the climber brings the left leg to bring the knee inwards. This is because the climber will be releasing the left hand to go up for the next hold. Which will be ideal when the climber gets to bring her body close for the reach. Her left side will be close to the wall when making the reach. The climbers are starting at a sit start. This is because the climber will have to place the hands and then feet onto the wall to then bring her weight over to the limbs being placed. Because of this, starting on a sit start can add a difficulty of grade into the climb. When the climber was engaging on a pull up to sustain the hold and go up to the next move, the climber's feet have come off the wall, this ending the climb. As we can see the climber was able to bring the left hand to come into place. This one, the climber is holding on with the fingers being above the hold. This one because they're in a big ledge, so the climber must try to close the grip by sending the palm towards the other side of the hold. The climber, in order to sustain it once applying the hand in place, is to keep the elbow close to the wall so that she's able to drive the pressure that is needed. And which she's doing by engaging the arm on the pull up. The climber was good that she made this reach by sending in both of the feet and especially bringing the left knee inwards. As we can see the right foot has continued to stay in position while she accomplished the reach. The climbers is starting at a one hold start where she places both of the hands onto the same hold. This is called matching and both of the hands are holding on to a jug with a lip that sticks out at the bottom of the hold. Once the climber gets to close the grip then she will be able to apply her weight over to the hands and the arms are kept extended so the climber is able to transfer the weight down at the feet when raising the hips. In this case the climbers left foot is the only one being in place and the climber is started raising the hips to come off the mat aided by the right foot touching the mat in this moment as she's gaining height of the hips coming towards the wall then the climber is bringing the right foot over to the wall. This is supposed to be a sit start so in the sit starts usually the climber needs to place the limbs first on the wall or not touching the ground and then raising the hips in order to be counted as a sit start so this one is a step out start.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The climber was then able to match into this hold, which I think represents actually a lot of progress, and they just lose their feet.

Now potentially the climber wasn't able to remain in place at the feet, this is because the climber already had spent some energy before going out to a different hold and having to retract to start over so that she can commit going up for this reach. In this moment, because the climber is boosting herself with the right foot pushing against the hold, the climber then can send herself over to the direction that she needs to go, while the left foot being in place will help the climber gain height. As the climber was sending the right hand to come to a match, we can see how the climber had brought the right knee to come inwards. This was so that the climber can have an easier reach while keeping her right side of the body close to the wall when raising the hips to bring the center of gravity with the reach. The climber, after making the right hand placement into a jug, we can see how the left hand is still continuing to be placed on that jug. And it's important that the climber looks down at the feet when making high placement or moving the feet up. In this case, the climber was able to remain both of the feet onto the wall when making the reach, which this was a good use of the body as the climber was able to get as close as she could when making the stands by bringing the hips close to the wall, also engaged by the pull-in of the left hand. The climber is up for the reach. In this one the climber yet has to apply pressure or curl the fingers inside of the hold. As the climber was gaining into a boost pushing onto the left foot, we can see how her left foot has come out of place. The climber is lowering her center of gravity and as we can see she's holding tight onto the grip, extending the arms to allow her center of gravity to be underneath her foot position. Then she engages into a swing where she pushes in her left foot to go out to the right. And when the climber is ready, she will then swing back and taking advantage of that momentum to stand up for going up to the reach. The climber has retracted from the move previously. This one coming back into the original position of matching hands in the same jug and repositioning the feet where she was once. Now the climber is looking at a hold of distance. This one, she will have to make a dynamic reach where she will have to push down onto the feet and then engaging onto extending the legs to bring the hips close to the wall while sending the left hand out at the reach. It's important that she brings her left side close to the wall and continue to keep pressure onto the left foot unless she is able to hold on to the top hold transferring over the weight to that hold and once securing the grip then she might be able to sustain cutting feet. But right now it's important that the climber focuses on her position right now before going out for the reach. The climber is starting at a sit start. Sit starts are known to add a difficulty of grade onto the climb. And this is because the climber, once making the hand and feet placement, wouldn't have the placement weighted. So the climber, in order to weight the placement, will have to raise the hips coming off the mat in order to start the climb. As the climber brought the left hand to come into place, the climber had released the right foot. This one so that she was able to transfer over the weight to the left foot when sustaining the reach and adjusting it. Now the climber, once securing the grip, she is extending her arms to drop the weight into the grips. As the climber has brought the feet to a higher placement, we can see how the left foot is coming into place where the left hand is. This one both being in the same hole, this is called matching. And now that the climber has reached the highest stance with the feet, the climber can now release the left hand to come into a high placement. As we can see the climbers is starting at a two hand hold start. Each hand is assigned to its own hold and both are slightly different. We can see that the hold is much shallower for the right hand as the climber is pinching on that hold and for the left hand the fingers of the climber are going behind the ledge of the hold, this one being potentially a jug. The climber then will have to press down on the feet to bring the hips up to the wall and when the climber is ready to perform the first move she will engage on the arms coming into a pull up and sending the next hand going up for the move.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She's able to get the height, but she just seems like she's not able to latch it, and so maybe she just needs to practice more on this angle, but I think keeping the foot engaged and really thinking about having the foot on the entire time and not cutting feet is gonna be super valuable for her.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The first thing I thought of when watching this as soon as I got back down into this match position is just go for it. Nothing really left to think about. You've already investigated the feet. These are what you have and I do think that this is a solid thought. You can totally do the boulder this way I think because you're gonna be able to then have access into this really good jug as a foot but the climber is just hesitating a little bit here and that type of hesitation will definitely reduce the power that the climber has just by sitting here thinking about it. So here we have the climber. They started in a dual start, square position. They get their hands into this jug, build their feet into the start holds, and now we have them matched on this slightly side-pulled jug, sort of entering the start sequence. And after kind of readjusting the feet a couple times the climber then goes for it and they get to the hold But they just don't get quite high enough So they can't really gain usable surface and they lose the feet. I think it's totally Reasonable to keep this left foot, especially I just think that the problem here is that the climber took too long to make this decision Climber then goes out left to this down pulling crimp and here they are kind of searching for a foot. But I think all the feet have somewhat left them. They can't really reach the right start hold. And the hold that is available next would be this hold which is just a little high as you can see here. So not a lot for the climber as far as additional right feet.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This potentially the climber had lost pressure the moment that she was trying to apply pressure onto the grip, but the grip had slid off from the hold. Since the climber was able to place the right hand at the hold at reach, she needs to continue to apply pressure by leaning on the hold. Now the right foot is far out and not completely extended yet, but the next hold for her at reach would be sending the left hand that is placed below to go out to the left. This one the climber will then have to press into her right foot in order to give her direction when going out for the reach. The climber was able then to move the feet at a higher stance, this one sending the left foot placing the toe at the edge of the hold, where the left hand is also placed, which had shifted slightly to the left side of the hold in order to allow the foot placement. As soon as the climber places the foot and applies pressure on it, the climber will then release the left hand from its place. When the two boat limbs being in the same hold, this is called matching. The climber was able to make the reach, however, failed to continue to apply pressure onto the foot. So if the climber was going to attempt this again, it's important that the climber moves up quickly so that she has the endurance to sustain that move. The climber immediately after sending the left foot out on the flag, flag meaning that the climber was not placing the foot in any holes and instead kept the leg extended so that eventually the foot will tap against the wall once the climber has gained height. In this one the climber was able to send the right hand out for the reach and has done this because before she had the arms extended onto a wide pull up, lowered her center of gravity, then pulled herself on a forceful pull by pushing down on the right toe being the one in place. Quickly the climber had stood up to make the right hand placement. This one is a jug so the climber is able to place the fingers behind the edge of the hold. As we can see the leg being extended helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the foot being in place as well as staying in balance to keep her hips close to the wall when at the reach. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet, this to secure the foot placement and the exact area where she wants her toe to be placed on the exact area of the hold. Once the climber has transferred the weight on placing the right foot, we can see how the climber's left foot has been extended. The climbers is starting at a two hand hold start. Each hand have its own hold and both of them being jugs as the climbers able to wrap the fingers behind the edge of the hold. Now the climber is placing the feet one the left foot is against a foothold and the right one is against the wall. The climbers is starting at a sit start and sit starts are known to be difficult because it adds a great to the climb due to the climber having to transfer her weight over to her feet being in position and the grips. This she will do by raising the hips coming off the mat and once the climber has placed the weight over then the climb will start. The climber due to pushing on the right toe in order to go up for the reach with her left hand, her leg now has gone extended and it's not placed in any footholds. This one when the climber made the placement of the hand, the climber had pushed the toe against the wall so that the climber can be able to remain in place on the extension to shift the weight over to the foot being in place. As we can see the climber right now is committed into a wide pull up. This is because the climber will have to tighten up the core and is glancing down to bring the right foot to come into a high placement in front of her. The climber was able to release the left hand to come into a match. This one being a jug as the climber was able to wrap the fingers behind the edge of the hold. And quickly the climber is getting into the position to go up for the reach. As we can see the right leg, the climber brings the knee inwards. This because the climber will have to release the right hand to go up to the next hold. This one keeping the right side of her body towards the wall will help the climber with gaining better reach. The climber was able to come off from the first move, this one, the right hand being extended into a jug and as we can see for the climber to gain even more reach to get length, she looks away. This can give the climber a couple inches at the reach. And as we can see the climber was able to keep the feet into position and raising the hips to come towards the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Looks like her foot maybe pops off, but she does a good job driving through that foot. She could maybe just pull a little bit harder with her hands and do the coordination a little bit better. So when she's pulling, when she's stepping up, she's pulling a little harder with the hands to move her a little faster. So that way she gets a little higher before she starts falling back away. You can see her kind of doing this hand foot match on the left hand. So hand foot matching kind of is just what it sounds like. She's bringing her foot to her hand, matching it so she can take the tension and move her hand up. So this is kind of valuable because it lets you immediately put pressure where your hand once was and just replace it with your foot. Sometimes it can be scrunchy but when it works well, it works well. It looks like it works pretty well in this case. So she's able to kind of free up that left hand to move because she's kind of taking all that weight to the left foot. So here you can see she's kind of doing a good job really driving through those feet. She does pull herself in with her arms. She's really pushing up through her feet and standing straight up. You can see she's kind of balancing out, keeping tension between both feet, so kind of using that hip flexibility to keeping those hips close while having both feet on. So having both feet on is going to let her push and drive through both the feet instead of having to balance one foot out. And then when she hits that first move, you know, she keeps that arm nice and straight, but tensioned, and then is able to kind of walk her feet up to get into the next couple moves without having to kind of pull in with her arm and kind of waste energy.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So after getting the side pull jug, the climber is able to go out left to this down pulling crimp here. Here we have a dual start, so both hands are on different holds, both looking like kind of mini jugs, and then we have two equidistant feet on the kicker, so the climber is starting square into the wall. And getting this right foot over and committing the left hand to locking off this edge, the climber goes up into this pink hold. You can see here they're just overshooting it a little bit. So the climber executed with a little bit more power than they needed. And because of this, it becomes much harder to target a hold when you go past it. Karma is then able to go right hand up into this jug here, and getting a higher left foot, and then building the right foot in. Able to get into a second square position here by achieving this match.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This one the climber is able to tuck the fingers behind the edge of the hold. The reason why this is a jug is because the climber can have a positive grip on the placement. However, the climber's right foot has slipped out of the wall. This will create a shock of loading into her grip and would be very difficult for the climber to sustain it. Once the climber made the foot switch, she has dropped the left foot out of the wall. And with the leg being extended, helps the climber to gain a civility over her positioning as well as balancing when necessary, for example, when going now for the reach. The leg extended, this is called flagging out and helps the climber to transfer over her weight to the foot being in place. So when the climber is ready to commit into the jump or dynamic move at reach, she will then pull herself in and send up over her right foot being in place. As the climber was bringing her feet into a high stance, we can see how the left foot comes into placement. This one the climber applies the sole of the toe box to come and meet with the jug to be placed by the front ball of the foot while the left hand is rolling out to be on the outer edge of the hand continuing to hold on to the hold. This one once the climber gets to apply pressure of the foot meeting to the hold and the climber will be able to release the left hand for its next placement. The climber was able to make the hold that reached, this one being a jug, where the climber can place the hand by sustaining the lip of the hold, wrapping the fingers behind the edge. And then as soon as the climber can secure the grip, then she will be able to lean onto the grip, keeping the arm extended. As the climber was making the reach, it was important that the climber encounters how to approach it with her body movement. First, the climber had to step down on the feet, raise the hips to bring it closer to the wall as she extended her legs, and continue to pull the left hand to bring the elbow close to the ribs. That to allow the climber on making the reach as well as twisting over to the right to allow more length onto the right side. As the climber is making the right hand up at reach yet to sustain the hold, we can see how the climber's left leg has gone extended and is being flagged out of the wall. This helps the climber to make a twist of her body going towards the right side to support the reach. The climber was able to make a placement of her left hand out of distance and quickly the climber brings the right foot to come into a match where her left foot is. This one the climber will have to continue to apply pressure on her left foot until the right foot can come and be pressured against the hole in order for her to release her foot out of the foot positioning. It's important that the climber engages on the grips tight, this one to release some of the pressure down at the feet while she does the foot switch. As the climber brought her right hand to come up to match, we can see how the climber has brought the right knee to come inwards. This was so the climber was able to bring her center of gravity close to the wall on her right side and it helps the climber to gain a better reach when going up for the right hand for example to keep her right side towards the wall. The climbers are starting at a sit start. Sit starts are known to be adding a grade of difficulty onto the climb. This is because the climber will have to raise her hips to bring her center of gravity to come and weight the hands and feet being in place to the wall. Once the climber has lifted from the mat, the climb will start. If the climber was going to attempt this move again, it's important that the climber keeps pressure onto that right foot to continue to be in place and think of that reach while pressing on the right foot to make the hand placement and do a lay back on the opposite direction of the opening of that hold, meaning the right hand will be placed onto the right side of that hold and the climber will have to press down on the feet, bring her hips to rise and then try to throw her shoulders back to weight the hold while the hips being raised towards the wall, the climber could continue to apply pressure onto the right foot being in place. The body positioning is important here. The climber continues to hang on with the right hand on the jug. In this one, the climber, once making the feet application, she pushes down on the feet and raises her hips to come as close as she can to the wall, while releasing the left hand from its placement that was matching on the left foot to come up to the next hold at reach. It's important that the climber always glances over at the foot placement. On this one, the climber brings the right foot to come into place into a foothold. And while doing this, the climber is able to rely on to that upper hold that she has gone up for the reach and leans back in order to apply pressure to the grip. Here, the climber has placed both of the feet onto the wall and has raised the hips to get into position. Quickly, the climber, starting in a two hand hold start, is making the move of the right hand going up to the next move as soon as she's off the ground.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

That seems like the timing of it as she goes, it almost just seems to be pulling her back from the wall. She's got the height on it, but then her leg kind of whips her off behind her. And usually moon kicking is like, if you were to go, you know, she's moon kicking with the left, she's going to swing this up and launch momentum to carry her left hand up even higher. So it kind of seems like a barn door move, but when you're in that barn door situation, you just jump up and latch something. Does a really good job of driving down through the feet. You can see her kind of twisting into her arm. So she's got both feet on and kind of suppressing with both feet so that's really good. She's kind of getting this twist in and that's going to kind of let her really pull in with this left arm and stabilize her body so she can really maximize this reach. And then does a hand foot match here on this left side so she's able to get this high right foot. Then by getting that left foot to her left hand she's kind of able to take all that tension from her hand and kind of just apply it down and be able to move straight up the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And they're putting this left foot out here to anticipate the counterbalance of putting left hand to this, all the way into the left arm and releasing this right hand. And because this distance is so far, as soon as this right hand releases, it's gonna create a lot of energy swinging the climber this way. And so this next move is going to be powerful. So here we have the climber, they're starting in this dual start position here. This is the hold and starting in this square position. You see they still do twist their hips a little bit, the right hip into the wall here and then locking off this left arm and coming into this side pull jug. So here we have the climber do a little pogo with the left foot And then power up right hand to this hold here I Think that this is just a little too much for this move. I think that it can be done a lot a lot more slowly But here the climber is opting to up the power where as in their previous attempt, I think they could have even reduced it. So Yeah, just a little too much gas for this move Climber then opts to build their feet and get a left hand foot match on the left start hold. Instead of what they did previously, which was matching this hold down low, they end up swimming the left hand up higher into this down pulling jug, which is going to be a much easier match.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This to bring her center of gravity, being the hips, to bring it close to the wall, especially when making the right hand transition to come to a match. This if the climber was to extend her stance and stand up extending the legs, then the climber will have to bring her undercling grips lower and not so much to be in front of her, where it would make it very difficult for the climber to pull it away from the wall, as this is not a very efficient way of holding to the undercling. The climber already has done two moves out. This is her third move and chooses to bring her left hand to the bottom of the hold as an undercling. Once setting that position by pinching on the hold and leaning back to create pressure to transfer over the weight, the climber now glances down at the feet. It's important that the climber also knows how to transition the feet in order to apply the correct weight onto that undercling. The climber then folds the left leg just so that the climber can come closer to the next hold. This one, the climber sends the left hand with the palm facing up and turning the hand inwards so that she can place the fingers behind the edge of the hold. This type of grip, this is called an underhand or an undercling. So the climber, in order to sustain this grip, she will place the fingers behind it and pull on it towards her in order to sustain the grip. As the climber had made that transition, we can see how the climber's left foot had come out of place first and quickly the right foot. This, the climber won't be able to remain on to the hold as she will be dropping the weight, having her slide out of her placement. The climber have retracted the right foot and put it into a wide stance over to the right side pressing on a hold. And this time the climber brings her right hand to come into a match at the undercling. As we can see in this engagement, the climber will have to keep into a tight pull in in order to sustain the grip. This one because the grips will have to be pulling away from the wall to then create pressure behind the lip of the hold with the fingers being in place. For more information visit www.FEMA.gov The climber is applying both of the hands onto the same hold. This is called matching. So the climber places both of the hands on the grip at the edge of the hold. This one being a jug, or I would say, because it's so big, a bucket, because the climber can wrap the fingers and the hand around the edge of the hold. Now, the climb will start until the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall. The climber is bringing the right foot to come into a match where the left foot is. This one because the climber's left foot is on a block so this one the climber could potentially hold both of the feet onto the same hold if she wanted to go and transition out left. However, it would throw the climber's center of gravity to stay over to the right side which would not be ideal when trying to sustain an underclaim. The climber not being able to secure the left hand on the undercling, she had to come back to her start hold and switches to make the placement of the right hand to go from underneath her arm to make that placement. It's important that the climber knows how to make the hand placement so that she's able to think of the moves ahead. So it's intentional that the climber brings the right hand to come underneath the left hand. And this one again, placing it as an undercling, but in this case, because it's in front of her, she will have to pinch on the hold in order to sustain the grip. The climber was able to make the placement of the feet and also continue to sustain her weight at the grips. The climber transfers over the weight at her grips by leaning back and as the arm's not being engaged and is extended. This is called a rest position. Now for the feet, the climber is raising her hips to bring her right side of the hip towards the wall and does this by bringing the right knee to come inwards while keeping that right foot in place. And the left leg being extended, the climber is pushing that block from the toe, pushing it so that is able to keep the climber pushed towards the right side to remain underneath her grips.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

They probably are a little too low to really be able to stand up matched into this undercling. Yeah I mean this right foot that's driving is quite low so I think that's one of the reasons why this undercling method is so difficult. So here we have the climber matched in this down pulling jug and we have this far away left foot here. So here we see the climber investigating this hold here. I do think this is the way to do this boulder. Maybe not this right hand cross under, but definitely getting to a point where you're matched on this hold.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This one is an essential foot to be in use in order for her to make the reach. So sending in this foot is already sending her down to the ground so it would be inevitable for the climber to make the reach. We can see her swinging left to right, this by bending the left leg and right now she is gaining momentum in order for her to commit into a reach, which she will do by continuing to hold on to the grip and when she goes back onto the swing she will then bend the left leg to transfer over her weight to the left foot when making the reach. The climber is starting at a one-hold start. This is by placing both of the hands into the same hole. This is called matching. And now the climber will be able to start the climb once the feet are placed onto the wall. If the climber attempted to do this again, she needs to make sure that that left stays in place when committing the dynamic move. This is because the climber will have to transfer over the weight to the feet and on the swing with the arms extended she will pull herself in, bring the left hand up and sending the weight, her center of gravity to be standing over the left foot. So this is an essential foot placement in order for her to make the extension up for the hand placement. As the climber places the grips on the jug, she's able to transfer the weight by leaning back with the arms extended. This is called the rest position.

So she's kind of got to toe in more and grab more instead of maybe moving left to right and pulling with the foot. So here's I'm pushing down through the foot and then just moving your weight over the foot. So what is good to pull the flip in this case where she's going to kind of move dynamically over it.

The climber after placing the left hand on the undercling, she is lowering her center of gravity. As we can see, pushing herself over and leaning back in order to then engage into a powerful move, potentially to go out for the next reach. The climbers is starting at our one hold start. This one the climber places both of the hands into the jug this one because it's easy for the climber to wrap the hand around the lip of the hold and When both of the hands are in the same hold this is called matching.

In this case, the climber could have used more of the middle of the foot to be pressed onto the side of the block, that to continue to push her over to be underneath her starting hold. And then whenever she was ready to be engaged after moving to the undercling, that she secures the foot to be ready to roll over to the top of the hold by placing the toe at the end to give herself a boost when making up the reach. The climber is already engaged into the dynamic move. This one the climber had lowered her center of gravity and then pulled herself up by pressing down on her right foot. This one immediately coming off from placement as this one potentially being out in the flag to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place on a larger block. Now as the climber is gaining height and releasing the left hand to go up for the next move, she must continue to pull down on her right hand being on the jug and on the left foot being in place in order to gain height. Here she brought her left hand up to the next move.

And so the climber was able to make this transition due to continuing to keep the right leg extended. This one being on the flag and the climber brought his right foot to come over and swing over to the left side gaining momentum over the swing. The climber releases the right hand to come into place of the jug and matching on the hold. As the climber performed the reach with the left hand to the last hold, we can see how his left foot placement has come out of place and extended the leg. This is called flagging and helps the climber to transfer over the way to the foot being in place. As well as we can see the foot has gone out onto the right direction with the leg extended. This helps the climber to balance over his center of gravity to maintain it over his areas of support. As the climber was making the left hand placement, we can see how the fingers are placed above a flat edge. This one the climber will have to create friction by placing the fingers and having the skin when making contact with the hold to slide the skin to create friction in order to stick. Once the climber feels a catch, the climber then will have to press down onto the grip in order to keep the hold in place. He has to keep his wrist tight and then eventually bring the elbow down in order to send the weight to the grip. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet when making a foot switch. In this one, the climber will have to hold on tight onto the grips to release some of the pressure down at the feet, but the feet need to continue to have pressure in order to not lose the foot placement. This one, the type of foot switch that the climber had to do was by applying the right toe above the left toe that was in place with the hold. Because there wasn't a space for the climber to apply the toe coming into place to the hold, the climber had to apply it over the foot. This one, the climber immediately, when forcing the left toe out of the placement, the climber's right toe comes into place immediately to press down to not lose contact with the wall. The climber has brought the left foot to come into a high placement. And this one the climber wants pressing on the toe against the hold, then he will be able to release the left hand from the monohold. Monoholds are usually going to drive a lot of strenuous power, so the climber must be careful in releasing it. This one by uncurling the finger on the inside and sliding it out in order to release the hold. In this case, the climber also needs to start thinking about pressing down on the left foot immediately when he releases the grip in order to make the next placement. As the climber secured the right hand going on the reach, he quickly glances down at the feet. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet, especially if doing a foot switch, where the climber in this moment is bringing the left foot to come into position to apply pressure before releasing the right foot from its place. As we can see the climbers left foot is positioned with the outer edge of the shoe against the hold. Now the shoe has a rubber so the climber will be able to create friction between the shoe and the hold and this creating pressure by pressing down on that ankle in order to sustain the grouping power of the rubber towards the hold. As we can see there was some space onto that hold and the climber is bringing the right foot to come into a match again match when both limbs are in the same hold coming into a match for making the right toe placement onto that edge of the hold so that the climber is able to release the left foot from its place. As the climber had released the left hand, the climber presses down on the left toe, releasing the right foot from its place. The climber keeps the leg extended. This is called flagging out. And in this instance, keeping the flag of the leg extended is to help transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. And as the climber is pushing down with the foot and pulling himself towards the wall, this one pressing the grip down, was so that the climber was able to gain height directly onto the next hold. This one being a jug, the climber is able to place the hand above the hold and wrap the hand. The climber quickly have moved the feet into a higher stance and then quickly released the right hand to send it up at reach. This it was important that the climber continues to close the grip and apply pressure on it by pulling away from the wall and as we can see the elbow continues to come close to his core in order to be sustained. Now it's important that the climber stretches the stance keeping the legs extended for the reach as it's important that the climber continues to bring his center of gravity being in the core close to the wall. The climber in order to complete the last move, he has positioned his feet with the right toe pressing above the hold and then had sent the left toe to come and press from underneath. This is called the bicycle move because he's simultaneously applying pressure opposing to each other and the foot pushing down and the other one pulling up is in order to achieve balance onto a static control while he makes the move. This one in order to do correctly, he needs to tighten up the core and is far more likely to get into a stable position on the wall. And if it's done correctly, this one usually is done also on overhangs. Otherwise, this is a very difficult foot technique. So it also helps with making it easier to grip, match or move between poor holds. the climber was able to send the left foot to come into match at the shelf down below. Now the climber continues to sustain with the left hand onto the monohold. A monohold because the climber only placed one finger inside of the hold and when he closes the grip, he is curling the finger inside of the hold and that's slowly engaging into a way where the climber can pull the grip away from the wall and also be able to pull it down, closing the grip tight to bring the elbow to be driven close to his core once he starts gaining height. So this type of grip, because it's placed from underneath, this would be considered an underhand type of hold so the climber can place it from above him and as he gains height, then he can bring it as low as his waist. The climber was able to position and apply friction onto the left hand. Now the climber in order to transfer over the weight onto the grips he is lowering his center of gravity by extending the arms and it also helps the climber to sustain the grips transferring the weight over to them because he needs to release some of the pressure down at the feet while making the foot switch. The climber is starting at a one hold start. This one, the climber is placing both of the hands in the same hold. And the type of hold the climber is holding onto, this is called a jug. When two hands are placed in the same hold, this is called matching. So the climber, as he's matching on the jug, because he's able to wrap the fingers behind hold, he will then start on a sit start. And sit starts are difficult to come off from, as the climber will have to bring his weight to place it onto the limbs on the wall. And coming out of a sit start adds a grade of difficulty to the climb. The climber was able to send the left foot to come into place into a big foothold. This one with sufficient ledge the climber can place the bottom of the toe box onto the hold. This one have sufficient surface so the climber can rely on forcing power over to the left foot. The reason why the climber was able to bring his right hand over to a match at the same rail. Now that the climber is relying on the grip as he's leaning back the arms being extended. This is called the rest position because the force is only being created at the grip. And when the climber is ready he will then engage on the arms by bending them on the pull up in order to bring his next hand up for the reach. The climber was able to send the left hand up for the next hold. This one we can see how the climber has kept the right leg to come extended over to the right side and has tapped the toe against the wall in order for him to stay in place. Now the climber had an easier time going out to the left side because the climber has brought also the left knee to come inwards so that he can keep his right side as close as he can to the wall. Then when making the placement of the hand onto the rail, this one is a shallow rail so the climber must place the fingertips above the hold and once securing the pressure by pressing with the thumb underneath, the climber will be able to apply pressure by leaning back on that grip. As we can see the climbers right foot has gone into a high foot placement and Quickly the climber sends the left hand to come on to the next grip this one we can see how it has a hole inside of the hold and this is called a mono hold if the climber gets to only place one finger inside of the hold and At times if a climber can fit two fingers and this would be called a two finger pocket Or if the climber is going to use just one finger inside of the hold this would be called a mono hold as the climber most likely will use the middle finger being the strongest one in the hand and If it's a two finger pocket would potentially be the middle finger in the index finger The climber was able to send the right hand to a match at the last hold. As we can see the footwork here, the climber believing that he was going to do a foot switch, the climber is actually engaging the toe at the bottom of the hold where his right foot is. By pressing on a toe hook where he places the toe to go underneath the hold and pulls up onto the hold, the climber's right toe is pressing down onto the same hold. This creating a compression to clamp down with the feet to keep the feet onto position as he made the transition of the right hand out of the hold. Now the climber must demonstrate a civility and control over the move with both hands on the last hold and if he's able to do this, then the climb is completed. We can see how the climber was able to bring the right hand at reach and before it had come quickly to make a match where the left hand was. The climber had engaged into a forceful pull up to send the right hand at reach and for this one it's important that the climber brings his center of gravity as close as he can to the wall. Reason why he keeps his right side to the wall as it would also help the climber when going up for the reach. He keeps the right side by bringing the right knee to come inwards. This is where the foot that he used to gain height and press down for and also kept the left leg to be extended to later on tap against the wall. The leg extended, this is called flagging out and it helps the climber to create a twist of his body to send his right side towards the wall. The climber is placing also the feet on the wall and as we can see the climber places the outside edge of his shoe to meet the top surface of the hold as the hold sticks out in this ledge. And the climber is about to place the right foot to come into position potentially against the wall on the foot chip. Once the climber places the feet he will push down on the feet to raise the hips, this one to transfer over the weight to the feet and then the climber will be able then to start the climb.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So he's left hand on, left foot. He wants to bring his right hand up, so he's just bringing this right foot back behind his left leg. Digging the toe in, and that's going to kind of provide three points of stable contact and not have him kind of barn door off the wall or twist off the wall. So here we can see he's kind of doing this twist lock technique. So he's one getting opposite opposed. He's got left hand on, right foot on. And he's kind of twisting his torso and chest into his forearm and bicep, which is kind of twisting his hips into the wall. And he's kind of flinging out this left foot. So his left foot's not only bouncing up, it's also kind of digging into the wall and creating tension. And so what that's allowing him to do is it twists up into the wall, bring himself close and this drive up the wall. So he's able to hit this high dead point. Now we can see he's got this undercling move, so if he pulls himself on this hold, he's just going to pull himself closer to the wall. So this is where his feet really come into play, and so he's really got to drive up through his feet. You can see him extending his feet fully, or his legs fully, fully standing up into this position, so that way he can make these big long reaches.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Building the feet just a little bit, the climber is able to reach up and right into this pink hold here. You'll notice this undercling lock off, 75 degree lock off, hips close into the wall, and reaching up high into this hold. So here we have the climber actually just one move in, but they're matched on this jug here and they have a really good right foot and the left leg is just kind of flagging into the wall. And after finding that nice position with this clamp foot, the climber is able to bring that right hand in for the match and the top. The climber is then able to get this left foot up real high on the crimp that the climber had used previously and actually match this orange hold. You'll notice that the climber is thumbing in on this bolt hole, which is always a good tactic and they're able to get the left hand into this in-cut crimp on the headwall. Climber then makes a big move upright to this hold and switches the feet on this pedestal foot and now their right foot is actually on what was the start hold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Now the climber is continuously pushing down away on the hold while pulling on the left hand grip. Once the climber had made the left foot placement, we can see how the climber is lowering his center of gravity and had extend the right leg with the foot pointing upwards. This helps the climber to distribute the weight over to his areas of support being both of the hands and the foot being in place. In this moment the climber is bringing himself out on a slight swing over to the right so that when he is ready he will then push down on the left foot to gain height when at the reach and it's important that the climber stays as close as he can onto the wall. The reason why the climber has brought the foot into place is to keep his left side towards the wall when making the reach of the left hand. The climber is this time bringing the left toe to come into place on the other side of the hold from beneath and is placing it in one of the ledges down below that he can get the most surface on by placing the toe. Now the climber will be pressing the toe, pushing away on the hold with the left toe while with the right foot the climber is pressing the heel into the hold. This being pressed into opposite their directions is for the climber to secure the foot placement as he will need to release the right hand from its place. The climber was able to release the left hand and brings it to match where the right hand is. Now the climber is sustaining into the same edge. He is continuing to do a pull up, this to transfer over the weight to the grips. And has brought the left leg that was extended to bring the foot close to his right foot, being the area of support. The climber was able to make the right hand up to the next hold at reach, placing it onto one of the ridges that sticks out from the hold in order to land the grip. Once the climber has secured the grip, then he will have to transfer over the weight as he will have to continue to lean back in order to apply pressure. The climber was able to make the reach due to sending his right hip up on the air when pressing on the right foot. This later on transferred over to the shoulders where he was able to bring it into the wall in order to bring the right hand into place. And to bring the right hand to come into a match at the same hold, this one the climber has barely any space for making the hand placement. And it's necessary that the climber also applies it in the right area of the hold, as he will need to continue to perform the layback in order to transfer the weight over to the grip. It was a good choice of the climber to remain on the right hand grip, this one being a more positive hold than the left hand. The left hand was the one that went up for the next move, and as we can see, this one was a much shallower hold, where the climber placed the fingertips above the hold, and then cupped the hand and placed the thumb onto the side in order to sustain the grip. This type of grip the climber must stay under it in order to sustain it as it will be very difficult to the climber when engaging onto the pull up to sustain the grip, reason why the climber has sent the left hand up to the next move. Taking advantage of the climber releasing the heel hook from its place and going into a slight swing, the climber then commits into a pull-up where he brings his left side of the hip towards the wall to engage in the pull-up to make the throw of the left hand while not having the feet connected. This is called campusing. As good as the climber glances down at the feet, this to make sure that he does an accurate foot placement and where he doesn't lose pressure at the feet during the switch. The left foot, the climber brings the toe to come into place at the hold and once the climber applies that pressure he will be able to release the right foot from its place. It's important that the climber gets to calculate how he will do the movement of his body when sending a reach in which he plays horizontally with his areas of support. On this one the climber has extended the left leg, this one being on a back flag because it's placed under the right foot being in position, and he taps the left toe against the wall so that he can boost himself over when making the move. As the climber goes up on the momentum he has brought his core to go up as this one is his center of gravity sending the hips up in which when the climber starts making the move out to the left where is in the area for the reach and the climber will be able to extend his right hand over to land when swinging over to the left. At this moment, the climber is continuing to apply pressure on opposite directions to sustain the feet, both matching the same hold and the climber has brought the right hand to come into a match at the pinch. However, he has yet to apply pressure due to the next hold being one at reach. Before the climber made the reach, the climber's left foot is the only one being in position. He had sent the right leg to be extended. This is called flagging out and he had used that so that he was able to transfer over the weight to the foot being in place as well as helping the climber with the twist of his body over to the left side. The climber has sent the right foot into a high foot placement coming into a match he brings the heel to come into place in one of the grooves inside of the hold and placing it behind one of the edges of that hold where the climber is sustaining his grip The heel placement is a strong placement Because the climber will be able to use it almost as a third hand where he can gain height by pressing down With the heel as well up as pulling himself into the wall by bringing his center of gravity close to the wall Um in the same motion that he would as for a hand Foot placements like the heel hook can help the climber stay in place since he's using the force of his thigh Engaging a different muscle and the climber could be moving to a series of moves Staying on the heel placement as well as one big powerful move The reason why the climber is performing some small pull-ups is because the climber is adjusting right now his grips this will help the climber release some of the pressure at the hands until he can find an area where he can have better friction to have a More positive grip As the climber was able to secure the grip on the left hand, he had dropped the weight and quickly has engaged on the core to make a high foot placement. The climber's body positioning at this moment is because he's engaging into a dynamic move to the next hold. This one because the hold is at reach, the climber is lowering his center of gravity and specially had released the left foot from its place and extends the leg out to the right. In this case, the climber keeping the leg extended helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the foot being in place, the right one, and also to bring his hips close to the wall. The climber continues to have the arms extended and what he will do is he will bend the leg, the right leg, in order to lower his center of gravity and whenever he's ready he will press down onto that right foot to extend the leg to send the right hand up for the next hold. Once the climber had sent the left hand up for the reach, this one being a pinch hold, as the climber places the thumb onto one side of the hold and the fingers onto the other, he will have to engage it into a pinch, squeezing both of the sides of the hold to apply pressure at the grip in order to then transfer the weight to the hand being in place. As we can see, when the climber was making that reach, the climber had pressed the right toe against the wall so that he was able to hold position when making the hand placement. The climber had brought the right foot with the leg extended being on a flag to be dropped below so that the climber was able to transition his weight underneath the grips, sending the right hand to come into a match. When both of the hands are in the same hold and this is the last hold and the climber demonstrates control and stability when sustaining it, then the climber has completed the climb. The climber was able to place the right hand onto the next hold. This one's coming into a match. The climber right now is applying an open half grip crimp position which the climber applies the fingers on a flat area and as we can see the knuckles are sticking out as he keeps the thumbs onto the side. This he will then engage into a forceful pull up to go with the next hand being the left hand. This is because the climber has brought the left knee to come inwards so that the climber is able to keep his left side close to the wall when on the reach. The climbers are starting at a two hand hold start. Each hand having its own hold, there are both different types of grips that the climber will have to apply. The right hand, the climber places with the fingers onto one side and the thumb engaged onto the other. This one, the climber will have to squeeze the hold in order to apply grip strength. This one, like clamping down on the hold by applying pressure with the thumb. And then the climber will be able to apply his weight by leaning back on the hold. And the same way with the left hand, the climber actually has a much shallower hold. It's not that positive as the pinch hold. And because it's shallow, the climber is applying the hand with the fingertips at the edge of the hold. And to create pressure, the climber closes the grip and also leans back to transfer the weight over to the top hold. Now the climber is making the placement of the feet onto the wall. Once the climber has brought his feet up onto the wall and is no longer on the mat, then the climb will start. The climber was able to bring the left hand to come into match at the hold. Here the climber is sustaining both of the grips onto the edges of the hold and in order to release some of the pressure down at the feet to allow the foot switch, the climber is engaging onto a forceful pull up to transfer over the weight to the grips. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet as he's doing a foot switch where he's releasing the right toe from inside of the hold and then bringing the left foot into place at inside of the hold to then press against the edge of the hold. On this one it's a very tight area for him to do accurate and easy foot placement to switch and this one because it's a small area the climber will have to hop inside of the hold in order to release the right foot and immediately press down with the left toe coming into place on the edge to apply force. It's important the climber continues to apply force at the feet so he doesn't lose his foot placement. Once the climber has secured the match of the foot placement in the grip, the climber then sends the left leg to come out extended, this one being on the back flag because it's folded behind the right foot being in place. And it will help the climber to balance over his center of gravity to his areas of support. And this one the climber is pushing down on the right foot while continuing to sustain the grip. As he pushes the right foot against the hold, the climber is gaining height and also bringing himself closer to his right hand placement. This so that the climber is able to lay underneath the hold before releasing the left hand. The climber was able to bring the left hand up to the next hold. Now, both of the grips right now, the climber is pinching onto the jug with the right hand and with the left hand, the climber is bringing his elbow over to the left side to apply pressure as this one would need to be applied as a lean back. So he engages into a pull-up position in order to release the heel hook from being in place. Heel hooks can be tricky to release. I could like make potentially the climber pendulum over and throw off his center of gravity if it's far away from the position where his grips are. In this case, the climber decided to at the same time release the feet being engaged on the same hold by tightening up the grip and dropping his weight onto the grips as he is now with the feet off the wall. In this case, the climber is bringing the right foot into a high foot placement by bringing the toe to come and to apply pressure at the hold. Once the climber has applied that pressure, he will then release his left foot to transfer the weight over to the highest foot in place. And at this moment, the climber's right hand only has a few fingers inside of the lip of the hold. So the climber is continuing to lay back in order to not lose the pressure at the grips. As the climber is committing to the swing to go up for the reach, the climber keeps the arms extended and right before he engages on the right arm, the climber releases the left hand from its place so that he's able to turn his hand to apply the palm over the hold at reach. The type of movement where the climber presses the heel down and the toe press into the wall, with pushing towards the hole in opposite directions but pinching it with both of the feet, this is called a bicycle move with the heel on. In order for the climber to bring his center of gravity close to the wall, we can see how the climber kept his left side towards the wall by bringing the left knee to come inwards in order for the climber to also generate power and when going up for the reach, his left side is this close in distance with the wall. The climber is able to continue pressure by pushing in two opposite directions while continuing for the climber to make the move going up for a bump of the right hand. This was a slow bump because the climber for a moment had to apply pressure at the match below but had kept the same position in order to make the right hand movement to a further reach. The type of hold that the climber is sustaining right now is a jug which is a positive grip where the climber can wrap the fingers behind the hold. The climber was able to bring the left hand up to the next move. This one is a donut with a sharp edge on the inside of the hold and it has an indent behind the lip of the hold. This one making it a positive grip but also uncomfortable to sustain due to the sharp edge. The climber will place the fingers behind the lip of the hold in order to apply the grip. Once the climber has applied the fingers onto the hold and is able to stabilize it, then he will be able to lean back to transfer over the weight to the grip.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So it's almost like he's climbing with three hands in this instance And here we can see it's kind of hidden, but when he kind of gets in this weird scrunched position, you know, he is engaged on this hold. He's able to kind of bounce out, you know, he's right hand on, right foot on, but he's able to kind of get this back leg with the left and really balance out and keep that position and keep it balanced and not have to kind of fight in this scrunched up, small little kind of box that he's in.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And then instead of fully matching this Waco crimp down here, the climber decides to just cross up and right into this pink hold here, which I think is very nice beta because you don't have to fiddle around with the crowded match. So the climber obviously feels very comfortable with that left hand because they're able to get a lot of distance with this right arm by locking down that left arm so deep. And after getting this nice pinch jug, the climber is able to cut their feet and then they just simply campus to this hold on the headwall. Sometimes the faster route is the better option. There's always workarounds to make moves less powerful, but sometimes, especially when you're getting a little bit tired, it's actually better to just use a faster option. So instead of looking around for feet and trying to make this move a bit more supported, the climber just commits to pulling down on this right hand and campuses up into this hold believing that it's going to be pretty good. And I find that sometimes the smartest climbers are the ones that know themselves well enough to know when they need to do something like this, like a campus move, even though it's technically not as good in the style department. It's getting from point A to point B faster. And after a quick match on this pinch, the climber is able to keep this foot tension here with the clamp and gun their right hand up into this jug here. And a bit of a thank you God moment for the climber because this hold is very good. And you do notice that the hips haven't gotten any higher. That's because the climber opted to use this foot clamp. If the climber had opted to bring the left foot down and flag it out and oppose the heel that way through gravity instead of pressing both feet together, it actually would have been a lot easier to get the hips higher. But that runs more of a risk of the heel popping. So a bit of a lesser of two evils for the climber here, but I definitely respect the method. So here we have the climber initiating the first move of this boulder. The right hand is on a brick pinch, and left foot is on a pretty decent hold out to the right. So they're starting in a back step, which enables the climber to have this left hip real close into the wall. And by locking down this right pinch, the climber is able to lift their left hand up and get into this Waco crimp here. Climber then brings the right heel up above the right hand and then brings the left foot in on the backside of this hold. So this foot is pushing this way and the heel is pushing against it in the opposite direction and so they're kind of clamped here. The only issue is that the climbers hips are now, it's going to be very hard to get the hips higher although they are in a pretty stable position. Initiating up from this position is going to be kind of difficult. And by walking the feet and doing a little hand foot match in the Waco crimp the climber Is able to get that foot and then bring the left hand up into a double undercling on this pink hold Climber then matches just slightly above the left hand into this little Waco crimp. And building the right foot up on the start hold, the climber is able to get their hips just a little bit higher.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So now the climber, once making the placement, he will bring the knee inwards to transfer over the right hand to come over to join the last hold. Now, the left hand, how it's placed is that the climber was able to slide the fingers underneath the hold as the hold has a lip at the bottom. And this one, this is called an undercling hold, where the climber, once placing the fingers behind the lip of the hold, he will be able to create pressure by pulling himself or pulling the hold away from the wall. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet. This to secure an accurate foot placement not only by knowing what area of the toe on his foot he would be placing but also like knowing exactly what area of the foothold he would be applying that pressure to. Once the climber had placed the left foot, he has brought the left hand quickly to the next hold, this one being a shallow hold, the climber is sustaining to a crimp. This is a closed grip one and the fingertips are placed above the edge of the hold. As we can see, the climber is giving all of its force into that shallow hold since we can see the knuckles are sticking out. And on this one, it's a three finger drag in which the middle finger is the one that is applying the most force, then later the index finger. The climber is then dropping the pinky and the thumb most likely, or if not, to be supported, creating a closed grip by closing the hand. The climber has brought the right foot to come into a higher stance and the climber is now completely leaning over his grips being in place onto two different jug sizes. The right hand is holding onto a larger jug where the climber uses the corner of that jug in order to wrap his fingers behind the edge of the hold. This one being a thick hold as the climber is just placing the thumb over it and applying gripping power on the fingers applied on top. With the left hand we can see how the climber is sustaining to a bowl slash jug because the climber is keeping an open grip but is able to place the fingers to slide behind the lip of the hold that is thick but and also the climber is able to engage more power onto that grip by placing the thumb on the other side to pinch onto the hold. The climber was able to release the right foot and keeping the right leg extended, going on a flag to transfer the weight to the left foot being in place. As the climber pulled himself in so that he can bring his center of gravity close to the wall, the climber had moved the left hand two consecutive times. The first move, that is counted as a move, and then after that the climber did one more and that stands another move. This is called bumping. The climber was able to make a right foot height placement. And this one the climber has now released the left foot from the foothold and keeps the leg extended. This is called flagging out and it'll help the climber to transfer over the weight to the foot being in position. As well as once getting a certain height where the climber gets to release the hand from the match, The climber then will tap the toe against the wall in order to keep his position ready to rotate over to the right side when making the reach of the right hand up to the hold. Once the climber has secured the right hand onto the jug, this one being a big hold, the climber quickly releases the left hand from the shallow hold. Now the climber is not engaging the arms and is keeping the arms extended. This is called the rest position as the climber is only engaging the grips to sustain the grip. The climber can sustain this grip for a longer period of time as the type of hold that is a jug is a beginner hold. Often seen on beginner routes. The climber making hand gestures is to mimic some of those hand placements he will encounter when at the wall, as well as studying the sequence. The climber has brought the right hand to come into a match at the last hold. This one placing the grip also on another lip at the top being a jug and the other one as an undercling a jug at the bottom. Now the climber must demonstrate control and stability over sustaining the hold in his position. If the climber is able to demonstrate that, then the climber has completed the climb. The climber had released the right foot from its place, sending the right leg out into a flag, and because it's folding behind the left leg, this is called the back flag. This is so that the climber is able to apply more pressure onto his areas of support when he sends the right foot over to the left side. As the climber needs to bring his center of gravity close to his areas of support, and quickly, once sending the leg over, the climber had pulled himself in to bring his right hand up for the promising hold, being a jug. As the climber went up for the reach, we can see how the left leg has gone extended. This is called flagging out and is used so that the climber can have a stability over the move. In this case, the climber having the leg extended also helps to transfer the weight over to the foot being in place, where he also had sent the right knee to come inwards so that he's able to be on his right side of the body towards the wall. Once the climber has reached some height by pulling and pushing down on the foot, the climber brings his left toe to come and tap at the wall. This helps the climber to have a rotation of his body when going up for the reach. In this case, the climber has gone up to a pinch hold where he engages on one side the fingers and the thumb on the other side in order to pinch the hold. Once the climber pinches the hold, he needs to continue to have pressure on the squeeze as clamping it down. Once the climber secures the grip, then he will be able to place his weight onto the grip. The climbers is starting at a two hand hold start. This one the climber will be able to place weight onto the grips when securing them and the climber is glancing down at the feet to make the foot placement. Once the climber's right foot comes onto the wall and his feet are no longer on the ground then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Then on this left foot, you can see he's kind of angled, so he's kind of where he places his toes very thoughtful and he's trying to pull into the hold so that will let him pull his body up and over to the left. He's going to start in this nice, engaged, but kind of relaxed position so he's not really fighting with the arms. He's keeping tension and power through his arms, but he's kind of sinking down into his body so he can really load up the feet and let the feet kind of do the steering. I mean, so he kind of does a slight backflick. So he's left hand on left foot. So he kind of lets this right foot drop behind him to balance out. So you can kind of bring this right hand up and over. So instead of having to swap feet, he kind of just does this little bounce trick with his foot, brings it behind himself. And that lets him balance out enough so that his whole body doesn't kind of rotate out away from the wall. He kind of does this almost twist lock technique, so he's getting opposite pose, left hand on, right foot on, and then he's using his bounce foot to keep tension so that left foot isn't on anything, but he's digging the toe into the wall, and that's going to let him push upwards through his feet, and kind of take more of the power and the drive to his lower body instead of having to pull himself up.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So here we have the climber in a dual start. There's this left hand kind of puffy jug hold and right hand on a sloper here. They have a high right foot and a low driving foot here. So this body position indicates that the climber will go up right hand. And after doing a series of jug moves, after the crimp lock off to the jug, the climber finds himself at the top holds here. Climber then immediately left the right foot and flagged it out right, committed to this left hand, lock off and got into this bread loaf two-foot hold.

The climber had to retract and reposition himself again. The climber this time is positioned on the sequence that he needs to go for as he is making the next moves out to the left. On this one the climber is sustaining with the right hand on a sloped hold, meaning that the climber is applying open hand and applies friction by pressing the fingertips down onto the hold to have it catch on the grooves of the hold. Now the climber as he is trying to apply pressure and doing this with creating friction between the skin and the hold, the climber can cup the hand and then lean on to the hold to sustain pressure. In this instance, the climber was able to walk over the feet to the left side of the hold so that he's positioned closer to his end hold. In this one, the climber has placed the right hand onto a jug which he holds as an undercling so that he can lower his position statically and releases the left hand from the matching hold. So that the climber can slowly drop the weight onto the feet. In this moment, the climber has retracted the left hand to come back onto the pinch hold as well as bringing his right leg that was extended to come into a match down at the feet. As the climber was able to make a right foot placement, when coming back to the wall, we can see how the climber has brought his thumb underneath the hold for his right hand. This will help the climber now engage into more gripping power by creating force of the thumb pinching on the hold. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet, especially when making a foot switch. In this moment, the climber is applying gripping power at the hands, just so that he's able to release some of the pressure down at the feet, while the feet continuously need to apply pressure onto the hold to not lose the foot placement. In this one, the climber's foothold is a chip, so he doesn't have surface for his right foot to come into place. So the climber in this moment brings the right foot to have the toe positioned on top of the left toe. And the climber does a hop to push the left foot to come out of contact, to take it out of place so that the climber's right toe can come immediately in contact with the foot chip. The climb will start until the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing on the mat. It's important that the climber always looks down at the foot placement. This one the climber is bringing the left foot to come into place at the bar below. So that the climber, once applying pressure, is able to release the right foot and that way the foot being released will allow the climber to transfer over the weight to the foot being in place. The climber was able to control the swing. This is because the climber kept the body tense on his upper body and from his waist down we can see how the feet went out on the kick from the swing. Now the climber must engage on the core to bring a foot into a high position. Before the climber send the right hand to come over to the last hold, the climber first pull himself close to the wall so that he was able to remain on that pull of the left hand to send over the right hand to come into a match. The climber must demonstrate controlling his stability over his position and hand placement. If the climber is able to demonstrate this, then the climb is completed. It's important that the climber does this accurately, the dropping the weight onto the feet. This one eventually the climber will release one hand at a time and in this case as he was doing this he had brought the left hand to come onto the side of the feet being in place. This to make sure that he secures the foot placement. Now the climber at first was raising the heels but in this instance he will need to drop the heels. This one's being faced up so that the climber will be able to apply the correct pressure when engaging on the toe hook. In this move, the climber is performing a bath hang. This because the climber will eventually need to release the hands from the hold. The climber first sends the right foot to come into the sloth. This to place about half of the foot into the hold and mostly to bring the toes to be pulling on the hold from the bottom lip of the hold. Quickly also sending the left foot to come into join in the same way. Now the climber will have to make a toe hook where he presses the toes behind the lip of the hold and raises the heels in order to secure the foot placement. But what's important here is the climber will need to release the hands and this he will do one hand at a time but first as he does this he will need to drop the weight onto the feet being in place by extending the legs As the climbers next hold in this move was at reach, we can see how the climber immediately sends the right hand open-handed due to landing onto a sloped grip. This one is rounded so the climber opens the hand and slaps a hold above creating friction with the skin with the force of the hold in order for the climber to stick the move because the climber jumped over his right foot placement and pushed down with his foot against the wall to go out in direction and make the reach. The climber's feet has disconnected with the wall so in this moment the climber is cutting feet and must maintain pressure at the grips and engage on the core in order to avoid a swing that will peel him off the wall. The climber has made a right foot placement, this one coming into high position first, and places the sole front of the foot to come into surface onto the right top area of the hold. This one so that the climber is able to pull himself in when he presses down on the foot against the hold. Now, the climber brings quickly his left foot once the right foot has been gone in place to be placed at the top of the hold by pressing down. Now, the climber is pulling and pushing, having both directions, but this is for the climber to secure the foot placement and securing it as they both are creating a pull and press at the same time, as the climber will then need to release the right hand to come up to a match at the rail jug above. The climber is making some hand gestures. This will help the climber to visualize the wall before starting to climb, as well as making some of those hand gestures, such as a pinch, which would be the way that the climber will have to hold on to that hold, and so on. The climber once more has made a foot swap down below at the bar and has sent the right leg to be extended transferring over the weight to the foot being in place so that the climber when extending the leg he's able to bring his left hand up to the next move. The climber is now sustaining to a big lip rail, this one being as positive as a jug because the climber is able to place the fingers behind the lip of the hold. Once the climber secures the grip then he will be able to lean back to apply pressure onto the grip. And as we can see when the climber was going out to the left and having the leg extended it helps the climber to keep balance onto that one foot being in place being able to rotate his left side of the body to come towards the wall to help the reach. The climber has extended the right leg, this one, by tapping the toe against the wall, keeping a flag as this will help the climber transfer over the weight to the foot being in place, as well as keeping the climber in position to bring his center of gravity close to the wall when making the moves. In this one, the climber had previously made a move from a bottom hold up to the pinch and when the climber makes another consecutive move, this is called bumping. Now that the climber was able to secure the right toe placement, he has extended the left leg. This one the climber is using it as a flagging out position which helps the climber transfer over the weight to the foot being in place. Now the climber is lowering his center of gravity. This because he will engage on the grips on a pull up in order to move his right hand up to the next hold. The climber continued to apply pressure at the feet going opposed from each other to sustain his foot placement from coming off the wall. Now the climber had transferred the right hand to come over the left hand and as we can see he's placing it into a safe grip. This one because the climber is able to wrap the hand around the lip of the hold and quickly once a climber makes the application he lays back in order to transfer the weight over to the grips. After the climber does this he needs to think about making the move for the foot placements. The climber was able to move out of the start hold bringing the left hand to a pinch hold. This one the pinch is placed vertically and the climber is sustaining to the lower area of the pinch because it's much wider at top which will be harder to hold on to the hold. The reason why the climber has gone over to pinch over in the lower side to have a closer grip. The climber is starting in a one-hold start. He places both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching. And he places the hands where the fingers are above the bar and the thumbs are pressed at the bottom of it. The climber will have to clamp down the position by continually applying pressure onto both of the sides of the hold. Once the climber has secured that pressure, the climber then will be able to lean onto the grips he's applying.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So he's utilizing the tops of his toes and they're acting almost like hands. So he's able to flex the tops of his toes against this really positive hold and just drop his body down below and just hang from his feet. Let's call it bat hang. While his feet do cut here, he's able to kind of push all the way up to here. So that whole movement kind of comes from his lower body and while he does lose the feet, he's able to get the handhold and still control the swing. And you can see it because when he makes the first move, he stays in the exact same body position. Really nicely cored up. Just overall looks really good. And you can see when he hits his first move, nothing changes. He's just nice, straight armed. So he's really letting his lower body take all the work and just kind of moving his upper hands through the positions. He does a good job once he controls the swing. He gets his feet back on and then matches it to get opposite pose. So now he's right hand on, left foot on. And he's in a really good position. So while he does cut his feet, he's able to quickly regain his composition and composure and just get back into the right position. Then you can see he's, when he cuts his feet, he's bending his legs. So it's going to kind of break, um, the lever. So his feet were way down here and straight. There's gonna be so much more weight further away from his fulcrum, which is his arms. So by kind of breaking his legs, he's making this part of his body that's swinging shorter. So it's easier to control. So first right off the bat is doing a really good job sinking into the start position. He hasn't even put his feet on the wall, but he's really getting comfortable in this like straight arm tension position. So that way he's going to be able to just kind of scoot in and put his feet on the wall, and he won't be fighting it with his arms at all. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. You can see he kind of gets opposite pose. So he was left foot on, so he swaps his feet. So now he's got his left foot flagged out. He's left hand on, right foot on, but still just super engaged to the core. You can see, you know, he's not drooping away from the wall. He's still very tense and rigid. You can see as he puts his feet on, he's really nice and engaged on that left, but he's got the opposite foot that's not on anything, kind of flaking up or balanced, but he's still staying super rigid so that foot's not just flinging off the wall, causing his weight to pull back. It's still staying rigid and balanced and aiding in this position, not taking anything away.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And after going up left hold to this green hold, the climber decided this was not the way so they dropped their left hand back down to this tufa. Here they are in this right leg drop knee, leg smearing into the wall. You have this left arm locking off here and just crossing through pretty easily to this green hold here.

And using some nice core tension, the climber was able to continue driving the left foot on what was the start hold, and they were able to just reach up very easily to this left hand. With this left hand to the jug, and then building the feet onto the tufa, doing a little foot squeeze, the climber is able to cross over into the left part of this jug.

In this case, the climber had brought the knee out being close to the wall when making the transition of the right hand over to match the hold and it's important that the climber continues to apply pressure onto that left foot. The climbers first move is out sending the left hand to the hold next to it, placing it as an undercling. So being an undercling hold means that the climber is able to place the hand from underneath and places the fingers behind the lip of the hold. As this is a jug that seems to be upside down, the climber will sustain it with the palm facing towards the lip and continuing to pull on the hold with the elbow close to her core. The climber is starting at a one-hold start with both hands on the same hold. This is called matching. And the type of hold that the climber is sustaining right now is to a jug, meaning that the climber is able to wrap the hands at the edge of the hold, which makes it comfortable and also able to have a close grip when sustaining the hold. If the climber was going to attempt this again, it's important that the climber knows how to continue to apply pressure onto that left foot. This is a block that the climber was pushing away from it in order to give pressure, but in this case the climber had shifted the right side to come towards the wall to make an easy transition to release pressure of the right hand to come into place. In doing so, the climber had to commit into a very close pull-in motion of keeping the elbows close to the core. The reason why the climber, when making the transition of pushing down on the right foot, to release the right hand, the left foot lost pressure. So the climber needs to continually be paying attention to that left foot placement when transitioning the weight onto the places in contact with the wall. It's important that the climber knows exactly in what area of the entire edge she feels a better grip on, not only to sustain a closed grip, but also that would make sense that when transferring over her weight, being this on the hips, that she would be able to lean over to that side where the hand doesn't get to slip off as she sustains the hold. The climber starts once the climber is no longer standing in the mat and right now the climber has placed both of the feet at height. The arms being extended is so that the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the grips and now that the climber has placed the feet, she brings over the weight down at the feet by raising the hips.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You know, she's keeping good tension on the feet. Now this is where she, when she gets this left hand, she's going to want to start moving her body as far left as possible. So that way she can kind of start moving up on the hold. And kind of now as she goes in for the match, this left foot picks. I think that's because she's pulling more with the left foot than she is pushing with the right foot.

It's important that the climber also thinks how to transition over to commit into the sequence and review from not being on the wall what the climber must do to make the next move. The climber in this moment has removed the right hand being in an undercling and she is right now crossing her body to keep her right side towards the wall, but places an open hand at the outside area of the hold. The hold has texture in it so the climber could place the fingertips towards those areas of texture and as if it's an open hand the climber will have to continue to apply the elbow close to the wall and lean back to create pressure and build friction between the skin and the hold. Climber is already on the wall for the take so it's unsure if the climber is starting at a two hand hold start or at a one hold start. In this case we can see how the climber's left hand is placed into a jug so the climber is able to sustain onto the hold by placing the grip around the edge of the hold. On pressing on the thumb it gives extra power for the climber to sustain the grip. As we can see the climber needs to continue to apply pressure on that left hand so it leans back by pulling the by laying back. In contrary the right hand seems to be going out for a reach. This one the climber will have to place the hand from underneath the jug. This one being upside down the climber will have to apply pressure the same way that she would with the left hand but this one comes from underneath. The way that this one would be held would be an under cling and the climber right now is sustaining her weight only on the right foot being in place. As the climber wanted to transition over to release the left hand for the next move, it seems as the climber was unable to do so and brought her right foot down at the ground. That means the climb is over. Right now the climber is positioned with all grips and feet on contact with the wall.

Once the climber gets to sustain that foot placement then most likely the climber will be able to make the reach. The climber places the feet at a high stance.

The climb will start until the climber places the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing on the mat. The climber wasn't able to achieve the hold at reach. It was important that the climber builds momentum before committing for the reach. At the same time, swinging way too long can take energy away for the climber to commit into the pull-in. And another aspect of why the climber didn't make it up for the reach was engaging on a proper push down at the feet. In this case, the climber, when gaining momentum to release the left hand, she needed to push down forcefully on her right foot first to later have her left foot, instead of pushing away since it was on the side of the block, could have rolled the toe over this slight area of the foothold.

The climber potentially rotating over to the right, bringing her right side towards the wall, might have had the climber not have the right pressure onto the top grip. Reason why she downclimbs and replaces the right hand to come into a match at the start hold. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet when performing a foot switch. The feet need to continuously apply pressure down at the feet so that she doesn't get to slip her feet out of the placement. In order to release some of the pressure down at the feet, the climber needs to pull herself in tighter onto her grips. Now we can see how the right foot, she's placing it over the left foot. And this is what the climber, whenever she's ready to release the left foot from its place, she brings the toe above the foot to immediately apply pressure towards the foot hold. The climber making the left hand placement and applying her weight She has lost pressure down at the left foot and is right now on the mat that means that the climb is over The climber this time brings her left hand up for the move and while going up for the reach we can see how her right leg remained extended. This was so that the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place and stay in balance when making the reach. The climber places the left hand above the flat surface of the hold. This one being open-handed the climber folds at the knuckles to close the grip and create friction. Now the climber must apply weight onto the grip by leaning onto the grip. The climber starts at a wand hold start where she places both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching and she's matching into a jug. It's a type of hold where the climber is able to wrap the fingers around the edge of the hold and places the thumbs on the other side to apply extra gripping power. Now the climb will start until the climber gets to step off the mat and places the feet onto the wall and is stable to come out of the first move. The climber once more has done a foot switch and placing the left toe to the foothold where the right foot is and instead releases the right leg to bring it out into extension to potentially push against the wall. The climber in releasing the left foot, we see her left leg going extended out to the left. This is called flagging out and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place.

This helps the climber to have a close grip to sustain the hand placement and have a stronger grip as she's able to close the hand rather than keeping it open and holding on to the edges of the hold. The climber while doing so had shifted the weight over to the left foot being in place due to keeping the right leg extended. This is called flagging out and it helps the climber to keep in balance over transferring the weight to the left foot being in place. She sends the right hand up for the next hold, this one being flat at the top where the fingers are able to wrap around the edge of the triangled pyramid hold. It's flat at the top so the climber is placing the palm above the hold to have more contact of the skin towards the surface of the hold. The climbers is starting at a one-hole start as we can see both of the hands in the same hole This is called matching and she's sustaining into a jug as she is wrapping her hands around the lip of the hold once the climber secures the grip she will be able to transfer over her weight by leaning on the hold as The climber right now is doing a step-up start where she gets to place the right foot into the wall And then once the left foot is off the mat and her she's no longer In contact with the ground and the climb will start The climber seemed to have made the right placement when going up for the move but has brought her left foot down potentially on Being stuck into the move or on not knowing of what move to go up next It's important that the climber studies from the ground what hand placement she would need to do for the sequence as well as Placing her feet in a way that would make sense when going up for the next move you The climber is glancing down to do a foot switch.

This he does by turning his left side of the body towards the wall and is able to do this by releasing the right foot from its place and keeping the leg extended. This is called flagging and so he's flagging out in order to transfer over the weight to the foot being in place. The flag helps the climber to also bring his center of gravity close to the wall as he reaches out with the left hand. He will gain more reach by bringing his left side towards the wall and to gain more height over the reach the climber looks away. In the climber applying pressure to the high foot, we can see his right foot coming out of place. Immediately the climber is coming into a flag, meaning that the leg is extended so that the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the highest foot and helps the climber to keep his core close to the wall, which is his center of gravity, when making the move. The climber lowers the right foot to come into a match. This is because the right foot coming into place high would have to push in the direction to come inwards throwing his center of gravity over to the right which would not be appropriate for the climber sustaining the grip above. When the climbers feet are off the wall, this is called cutting feet. And this is when the climber has recovered by placing the right foot onto a large foothold. Once the climber creates pressure of the foot against the hold, he will be able to bring his center of gravity close to the wall in order to stabilize the move. As the climber makes the reach of the right hand up for the next hold, places the fingers above the hold and wraps the thumb on the other side. This is called a pinch grip, where the climber will have to squeeze onto the hold in order to secure the grip. Once the climber secures the grip, he will be able to apply his weight over the highest hand, being in place and leaning on it. In order for the climber to make that move, he pulls himself close by locking with the pull with his left arm and the left toe tapped against the hold against the wall so that he can continue to pull his center of gravity close to the wall in order to secure the move. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet when making the foot placement. That way the climber is able to visualize exactly in what area of the hold the climber must apply pressure. In this one, the climber places the toes. This one, because the climber will be able to apply the most pressure on his stance to that area of the foot. The climber once brought his right foot into place to civilize his swing. He sends his right hand to come into a match at a jug. This is a positive hold so the climber will be able to transfer over the weight to the grips by leaning back. And the climber is glancing down at the feet as he's matching on the large hold down below. As the climber performed a dynamic move up to the hold at reach, his left foot has come out of place sending the climber out on a swing losing his center of gravity close to the wall. In this case, the climber must sustain tight onto the grips for him to control himself from swinging more than he should. So in this case, the climber will engage into the core and bring his legs up in order to make a high foot placement that would prepare him in position for the next move. The climbers next hold is one that reach and brings his left hand into place at a jug which this one is a safe and Promising placement as a climber will be able to hook the hand at the edge of the hold by placing the fingers behind of the edge of the hold the climber can easily close the grip and Place his weight on the highest grip now the climbers Before committing to this move he had glanced over at the feet to release the right foot and Chose to keep it extended. This is called flagging out. So the climber is able to continue to apply pressure onto the left foot being in place as well as keeping the Flag helps the climber to stay in balance when making the reach The climber sends the right hand up for the last hold and immediately continuing to step onto the left foot That is the one in place Sending the left hand to come into a match When both hands are sustaining into the last hold and the climber is able to demonstrate control over the move and being able to Show a stability while sustaining the hold then the climb is completed As the climber visualizes the wall, he is making some hand gestures, this so that the climber is able to have an idea of what to expect on the sequence of the climb. The climber is glancing down at the feet to send his left foot to come into a high foot placement. It is important that he glances down at the feet specifically to this foot placement as he is applying it into a small foot chip. The foot chip has a very small edge so the climber will be generating power by pressing down onto the foot hold. But this one the climber places the very edge of the toe and needs to make an accurate foot placement in order to apply sufficient pressure. Once the climber secures the foot placement then he will be able to push down onto the higher foot and eventually pull himself in to send his center of gravity over to the high foot. Once the climber has secured the left hand grip onto the hold, he glances down to make a high foot placement and does it onto the side of that pinch hold. In this one, the climber must push away from the hold in order to create friction between the rubber of the shoe and the hold. The climber right now is bringing the feet into a match at the same hold to perform a foot switch. Ideally, the climber should be glancing down at the feet when making this switch to secure the foot placement. But in this case, the climber brings the left toe to come into place and by feel, he places it and presses it before releasing the right foot. Right before the climber commits him to making the next move we can see how his left foot has been released from the foothold This the climber keeps up leg extended. This is called flagging out So the climber is able to transfer over the way to the highest foot being in place Also flagging out helps the climber to stay in balance and gain a civility over the move in which he right now is pulling over towards the wall In order to make the move The boulder problem starts with a two hand hold start, meaning that each hand has its own hold, and both of them are two different types of grips. The right hand is more of an open grip, so the climber places the fingers above the hold, and since it's open handed, the climber must create pressure by creating friction between the fingers and the hold, keeping it cupped so that the climber, once has the catch of the skin towards the hold, will be able to apply weight onto it by leaning on the hold. For the left hand, the climber is able to sustain the jug as he's able to wrap the fingers behind the edge of the hold. This is a step up start, so the climber once places the feet onto the wall, then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So he's kind of getting in the right position and really sinking down and into the wall so he can kind of load up the feet properly. Now you can see him really staring down at his feet, so he really pays attention to his feet and loads them up and gets them in the best position. Now he's kind of doing a good job where he might not have both feet on, but what he does is when he's making him move up, he's moving his left hand up, and he's gripping with his right hand.

And the climber then goes up left into this crimp here, and I think that there is a hold in this section that's actually a jug, and the climber just decides to skip that as well, which I think works. Sometimes a more direct route saves more energy, even if it is a little harder. The climber then is able to bring the right foot up and continuing to drive off of this left foot. The climber locks this down at like 7 or 25 degrees and gets up very nicely into this tufa pinch.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

In this case, he could have matched on the hold where his left hand was and work on foot placement in order to bring himself over to the left side on the route. The climber is often glancing down at the feet, this is because he is bringing the feet onto a match, bringing the left foot where the right foot is. Now, the transition of the right hand, the climber is bringing it over to the hold, however the hold on the inside is much smaller with the edge that is rounded, so the climber must find a way to place the fingers onto the hold to sustain the grip. In the climber making the feet placement, we can see his left hand has shifted to be now positioned at a different hold. Usually when there is a start hold, there might be only two that he would be sustaining to, but on this one going out to the left would depend if it's part of the sequence on the route. Now the climber is standing on the mat and must bring the feet up into placement. Once the climber is no longer on the mat, then the climb will start. As the climber was making the reach, we can see he missed the right hand coming onto place to the large hold. In this case, it's important that the climber knows how to sustain the move if making a move across that is a distance as he needs to continue to raise his center of gravity towards the wall while making the extension. As soon as the climber didn't get to place the hand, this was dynamic and instead of being static, the climber loses immediate pressure down at the foot and at the grip due to his extension. The climber when securing the right foot placement he's pushing away from the hold. However, he sends the right hand not to come onto a match where the left hand is but instead goes totally across over to the next hand placement. This one trying to get into one of the ridges of the hold in order to place the fingertips. The climber making hand gestures from the ground would actually help the climber visualize the climb as well as trying to figure out from the ground the sequence that he must do when placing hands or body movement. The climber is struggling making the right hand placement. He sends it back down To come at the pinch hold and as the climber has applied pressure on the left foot Being higher up where the right foot was he's sending now the right foot to be at a higher stance Where now once applying the climber gets to place the toe to push against the side of the hold He will be pushing away from the hold making it easy for the climber to make the transition of the right hand once that foot applies pressure It was good of the climber to send the left hand up for the next move. This one because he was holding on to a start hole that is much smaller which makes it difficult to sustain if committing into a move and the pinch grip is more positive for him to sustain for a longer period of time when sending the elbow out, pulling it away from the wall to sustain the grip. Now as we can see the climber has twisted over to the left side when engaging into the reach as he pushes down on the right foot bringing him over to gain height when making the left hand placement. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start. The right hand, he's pressing it as a pinch, where he gets to grip by placing the fingers onto one side of the hold and the thumb on the other to apply pressure onto the grip. And then for the left hand, the climber is placing it into a small hold where the climber places the fingertips above the edge of the hold. And as we can see, the knuckles are sticking out. This is called crimping, when the climber has to close the grip tightly in order to apply pressure to the fingertips.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And when he isn't able to make the match, he kind of realizes it. He kind of sets himself up to kind of do this big leap over to this pink hold and just isn't able to make the move or hold it. So kind of thinking outside the box, kind of a good last ditch like effort like Hail Mary, but just isn't able to really pull it off. I think too, it's like as he gets tired, he's not going to take as much to his arms. So this is where it's important to have like the good feet, good body positioning. So you can kind of sink into those feet and relax.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They come up a little bit short on the hold, but the nice thing about this method is it makes it so you don't have to match this crowded hold here. I just think that maybe some of the footwork could be improved. I think if the climber uses the edge instead of the side of the pinch, they'll be able to get a lot higher and thus get into this hold. And I also think that it will be less stressful on the body in general. Here we have a good look at these two start holds here. So this is just a down pulling kind of three finger edge and this right hand brick pinch here for the right hand. And so here we have the climber with their left hand and on this Waco crimp. And here they are hand-foot matching on the pinch. This is just a little peculiar to me because they also have this, which would be a much better foot and you wouldn't have to make room with the hand. So I don't know why they're choosing to use the pinch, but it does seem like this would be a much better foot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So he is right now engaging on the core to pull himself in to reposition the foot back to the foot placement. The climber brought the feet into a match where the left toe is now left behind at that foothold to bring the right foot for a higher foot placement coming into a match where the right hand is. Now both the toe and the fingers are inside of the hold and are pressing away from each other to sustain the grip. Now once the climber gets to secure the right toe placement against the edge pushing away from it, he will be able to rely onto the three points of contact on the wall in order to release the left hand. The climber is pulling forcefully onto the grips due to cutting feet at this moment when he released the left foot from its place. So it adds extra gripping power when the climber engages on a pull-up. The climber instead had brought the left foot to come into place at the orange hold. This one pushing away in order to push his center of gravity to remain underneath the grips. At this moment he had extended the right leg to go out into space. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. And right now the climber while sustaining into the grips of the match, he lowers his center of gravity by extending the arms so whenever he's ready he can commit for the next move on the route by pushing forcefully on the left foot being in place and swinging over his grips to gain momentum when going up for the reach. The climber sends the left hand to the hold at distance, this one having a hold in the inside with a sharp edge towards where the climber is placing the fingers behind that edge. The climber, once placing the grip, he will be able to transfer over to the grip by leaning back and it was smart of the climber to move over the left hand first out of the two start holds because the smaller hold from the start is harder to hold on for a long time compared to the pinch hold. The climber is glancing down at the feet and as we can see he's placing his right foot into a foothold pressing the toe against the hold in order to create pressure. That way the climber is able to then raise the hips to get the climb started. we can see his grips matching at the same hold edge. So in this one we can see only a few fingers are applied for the left hand grip, potentially about three fingers into the hold so that he's able to wrap the right hand fingers onto the side of the hold being towards the left side edge inside the hold. That way the climber would be able to release the left hand to bring it over to place. The climber brings the left foot to be positioned at the same hold where the right foot is. When both of the feet are in the same hold, this is called matching. Right now he's pushing with both of the feet against the wall to not lose pressure at the feet and lose contact with the wall. As he makes the contact of the left toe coming into place in the hold, he will be able to release the right foot to bring it into the next foot placement. He's pushing away from the hold with the feet keeping the climber's center of gravity underneath his grips. The climber in transitioning the right hand out of the pinch hold, we can see it being placed onto a match at the hold above. The groove behind the edge of the hold is shallow and the climber only has so much space to apply his fingers. On this one he places the right hand to go over the left hand and at this moment applying his fingertips onto the same groove. As the climber transitions, his right hand from the hold down below, he brings it over across the left hand and is also bringing the fingers behind that edge of the hold and pressing on the thumb to sustain, to secure the grip. In doing so, the knee was being pointed inwards so the climber can apply extra pressure onto that foot placement but the right foot has come out of place. This one giving a lot of power will send the climber's center of gravity away from the wall. The climbers starting at a two hand hold start Each hand is sustained differently. The right hand is held as a pinch hold since the climbers able to Bring the thumb over to the left side of the hold and applying the fingers On the outside the climber will have to squeeze the hold in order to apply pressure onto the grip With the left hand the climber places the fingertips at the top edge of the hold and as we can see this is held very tightly So the climbers knuckles are sticking out to apply extra Pressure onto that grip and brings the thumb on to the side to also do the same Once the climber was able to control that pull up, he drops his weight by extending the left arm and so the right arm so he can send his foot back up into a high foot placement, this time bringing the right foot to come up against the wall. Once the climber has made an immediate placement on the left foot, he engages into a forceful pull up, releasing the left hand from underneath the right hand to bring it out onto a throw to the edge of the hold. This is a hold with many grooves, but there is an entry where the climber is able to place the fingertips behind the edge of the hold. The climber glances down at the foot placement, this one because the right toe was positioned all the way to the edge of the hold and brings it over slightly inside to be positioned in the middle of the hold. It's important that the climber secures the foot placement before committing into the move. If the climber attempted this again, he needs to make sure that he places the right foot accordingly against the edge of the hold. This is important that the foot placement does not lose any pressure once it's placed as he was transitioning over his weight to the grips but needs to continue to apply that pressure onto the right foot placement. Whether the climber is starting at a sit start or a step up start, once the climber is no longer standing on the mat or seated on the mat, then the climb will start. The climber then has let go of the hands due to not having the correct start holds. So places the left hand to a hold that's much closer to the pinch hold. This one also being a very small hold. This is called a crimp and it's almost the same size as a foot chip. So he will place the fingertips above the edge of the hold and the knuckles will continue to be sticking out in order to engage force to the grip. Also since this is a two hand hold start he will also use the pinch hold in order to use it as a start hold.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So ideally, you kind of like make the move with his feet and then be able to hand foot match, but keep the tension through his toes, especially for this hole where the positive side is kind of angled. He's going to have to be kind of pulling through there. He's not able to just kind of pull straight down, so it's going to be an extra challenging hole to cut feet on. So you're going to see as he makes these moves, he does a good job of getting his body underneath the holds. So he's kind of pulling straight down, letting kind of the friction help. He's not really pulling up or fighting too much within the hold, so he's not pulling himself off the feet. And it just is able to keep the tension on the feet and just slides right off. Seems kind of unsure on the feet so, especially on this move right here where he's kind of going up to this pink gas stone, he kind of readjusts his foot a whole lot, doesn't seem very comfortable on it. But for this move it's going to be a lot easier for him to drive and kind of pendulum around this hold. That would be it for him to kind of pull up through this hold to get here.

So you have the climber one move in on this boulder Right hand is on this pinch the left hand was on Just like a crimp Close to the pinch we have them darting left hand up into this little Waco crimp hold here And after getting the feet back on, the climber attempts a hand-foot match in this Waco hold and comes in and match and it just slips off. So again, just a lot of intention with the hands and not enough emphasis to put force through the feet. And this results in a lot of foot cutting and foot popping as well. The climber works their feet a little bit down here, gets into a position where they can attempt this match. You can just see how crowded this match is here. It's really hard to get both hands in on this hold, which is one of the reasons why this is a taxing position to be in.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As we can see he's placing half of his foot into the sloth because he will be then dropping the weight onto the top areas of his feet. The climber making the adjustment of the right foot behind the edge of the hold, he lost the placement due to not hooking his toe behind the edge of the hold and instead has slipped off aggressively out of the placement. Dropping the weight fastest way even if his right hand is still in place will be very difficult to recover from. In this case we can see how the climber is actually pushing his right toe up behind the top lip of the hold and hooking the left toe down behind the edge of the hold. This so that he can create a camming position as he's transferring over the weight and doing his extension. As the climber releases the right hand he brings it to cross over the left hand being in place. Now both of the hands are crossed over coming into a match at the same edge. This type of grip is called a jug because the climber is able to place the fingers behind the lip of the hold and can use the thumbs if he wanted to to create extra grip strength by squeezing onto the hold. But in this case is mainly if the climber places the fingers inside of the hold and then will be able to drop the weight by extending the arms. As the climber had brought the feet up into a match at the hold down below, the climber shifts to right hand grip to instead of being an open hand placed above the lobe to send the thumb underneath the hold so that the climber can create more gripping power and create more pressure with the thumb underneath as a pinch. Now the climber is glancing over to the next move and so he's keeping his center of gravity low to keep his right arm extended. Not having it engaged helps the climber to not spend so much energy onto the right arm and instead just on the grip. When the climber is ready, he will then switch the feet by dropping the right foot potentially and keeping the one foot in place. So when he's ready, he will engage on the hand at reach to be engaged into a pull up to then release the lower hand from its place. The climber sends the right hand up for the next move. This one he places over an open hand lobe which is sloped so the climber cups the hand above the hold. Now as we can see he's keeping his right side towards the wall. This way because the climber once placing the right foot onto the hold, he's able to bring the right knee to come inwards, helping the climber on keeping his right side towards the wall as well as helps the climber with transferring over the weight to the foot being in place by having the left leg extended as it supports the climber with having the twist of his body over to the right side. The climber has brought his left leg that was out on the flag to place the left toe above the hold where his right foot was. Now he is pushing away from this hold and immediately brings the right foot to come into place into that other sloper hold also to push away from it so that he's able to continue to be placed underneath his grips. The climber entrusting the positive grip out left, we can see him now transferring most of his weight over to the highest grip and comfortably leans back to bring his center of gravity away from the wall to make a high foot placement in which he's bringing right now at a high stance. Once the climber gets to apply pressure onto the right toe on top of the hold he will be able to then bring his right knee into the wall to transfer over his weight that way he can release his right hand grip over for the next move. The climber once immediately brings the left foot to come into a match at the hold. He brings the left knee to come inwards to release pressure at the right foot as he will drop it off the foot placement. This will help the climber to push against the hold in order to create pressure of himself getting his left side towards the wall as he sustains the right hand on the grip. But he will do this quickly as the next hold would be one at reach that seems promising a jug with a positive lip where the climber if he makes a move quickly he would then be able to sustain the move. If the climber was going to attempt this move again, it's important that once he has both of the feet placed into the slot that he uses other holds on the weight that are in the sequence of the climb in order to lower himself slowly by extending the legs that will help him then have more control, reach over the last hold. The climbers is starting at a one-hold start, placing both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching and he places both of the hands as a pinch grip because he places the fingers above the edge of the hold and places the thumbs at the other edge of the hold from the bottom. This will help the climber to engage into a squeeze onto the hold in order to create pressure. Once the climber secures the grip then he will be able to transfer his weight by leaning back as he in this moment is coming out of the mat and making his feet placement down below. Once the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing in the mat then the climb will start. this moment the climber decides to bring his right foot to the inner area of his foot to come behind the edge of the hold and release the left foot from its place as he is performing the extension of his legs to drop the weight and continuously is holding on to the right hand grip. He needs to find a way to transfer over his weight to the feet being in place above in order to commit to the last hold. Once the climber is able to apply the top areas of his feet towards the lip of the hold, he brings the toes to come folded behind the lip of the hold. This one's creating a toe hook. So the climber first releases the left hand to go out for a reach down below and he must slowly extend his legs in order to drop the weight and to consistently apply pressure at the feet being with the toes folded behind the lip of the hold. The climber sends this time a switch of feet and brings the left leg to be extended. This is called flagging out and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. As well as helping the climber to twist over to the right side and tapping the toe against the wall helps the climber to stay in position as he was sustaining with the left hand first on the hold to bring the right hand over to match. Now the type of hold that the climber has is rounded and this is called a sloper. So the climber is bringing the fingers above the hold to be placing the palms over in each side because they're matching and the hold is not as large. The climber is placing the fingers one over the other and crossing fingers potentially and the climber in this moment needs to keep the elbows close to the wall in order to keep the palms surfacing entirely onto the sides of the hold. As the climber is in front of it he has to apply extra pressure by pulling the hold down in order to stay in place. Once the climber applies the right hand onto the hold at reach, he is able to place his weight over the grip. Once he cups it and creates friction between the skin and the hold, coming to a catch, dropping the weight onto the grip. The climber then releases the right foot and none of the feet are right now onto the wall, they're up in the air. This is called cutting feet and he is having control over his movement by tightening up the core. That way the climber is glancing down to make sure he brings his next foot at a high foot placement as he continues to pull onto the pinch on the left hand to bring himself close to the wall. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet, especially if performing a foot switch, which he does by bringing the right foot to come into place at the same hold where the left foot is, coming for a slight second into a match. So he applies pressure with the right foot coming into place, and once he applies pressure on the right foot, then he will be able to release the left foot from its place.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So here we see him kind of sinking real low into his hands again. So he's not kind of pulling himself up at the start. He's kind of letting his body hang down off the start, kind of perfectly underneath the hold, letting his feet kind of sink down into the footholds. And so here it seems like he's kind of fumbling the end a little bit. So he's got a bad hang off this big purple hold. So it looks like he just needs to kind of get his feet in and like maybe space them out a little bit but really engage the toe. It seems like he's not really engaging, just trying to hang on the friction. He just keeps readjusting them, causing them to kind of slip away. So at some point he needs to kind of commit to it, which is with both toes and not try to do this weird side jamming thing. Good job here of staying opposite of pose. So he makes the first move, his left foot's on. Then immediately once he's got his left hand on, he switches himself back over to his right foot.

As we can see the climber is in mid-flight or up in the air at this point from the push and his chest is meeting at the same distance where his hand placements are and before sending the right hand up for the reach he has brought his chest to come as close as the wall as he can this so that the center of gravity being on the hips can follow that direction on being close to the wall. The climber brings the right hand to come on the top area of the donut hold, sending the thumb towards the inside to be wrapping around the hold with the fingers on the outside. Now the climber has repositioned the right hand before committing into the dyno move. It's important that the climber knows exactly in what area he will need to hold on to as he will have to eventually when gaining height at the jump, he will have to pull himself towards the wall in order to commit for the move and since it's the right hand that's coming out of place to make the dyno hold, he would he potentially thought about this placement to bring the hand closer to cut time on the transition of the right hand going up for the move. the climber on this move we can see his center of gravity being far out from his hand placement which ideally he wants to continue to keep his center of gravity underneath his grip. In this case the climber's swing was more forceful than the force that he could apply in the grip to sustain the move and sends the right foot to come into place on the mat ending the climb. This to make sure he doesn't fall out of into his face onto the mat when the hand comes out of place as he with the hand we can see has lost pressure coming out as a peel-off motion. If the climber attempts this again it's important that he gains height slightly to bring his center of gravity to be lined up where his right foot placement is and that way he can boost the jump and stay underneath the dino hold. Another method that he could approach this dino would be keeping the left hand in place as he has the length of the arms to reach from one hole to the other and so the climber could place the right hand onto the hold securing that grip while sustaining into the left hand grip as well as keeping pressure on the right foot. Once the climber secures the grip instead of dropping his weight immediately he could secure the grip and then slowly release the left hand and the foot to have a more controlled swing. The climber in this moment must continue to keep the center of gravity underneath his place of support being the right hand grip. As he is right now going out for a swing since he's no longer in contact with the wall, penduluming out, the climber then will have to send the feet out on a kick in order to sustain his placement, especially when dropping the weight. If the climber can send the left hand to come into place to support that area, then that would be better, but in this moment the climber must tense the body in order to sustain the move. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start. Each hand, he's holding onto a hold that is shaped as a donut. So we call it a donut hold. The climber is able to wrap the fingers inside of the hold. As we can see, he places it at the bottom area of the holds and is able to place the surface of the palm to meet with the round section of the hold. As we can see also, the thumbs are pressed on the outside of the holds, which will help the climber to engage into having more gripping power as he squeezes the hold. Now, the climber is sitting on the mat and at this point, he is glancing over to the hold at reach as he would need to commit to a dyna. Once the climber places the feet onto the wall and is no longer in the ground, then the climb will start. The climber is sending the right hand up for a placement. He sends the grip to be open-handed this so that the climber is able to land the surface of the hold with placing the skin over it and finding a catch this is called friction that he must create and as soon as he feels that then he will be able to transfer over the weight to the grip by leaning on to it. As we can see the climber continues to sustain onto the left hand grip when making this hand placement so that he can slow down the process of transferring the weight and the climber had pushed the right foot to boost the jump however has pushed him away from the wall in which ideally he needs to push on that right foot when he gains a slightly more height in order to stay close to the wall when making that hand placement, but in this case the climber had engaged it slightly earlier on his height in time pushing him right now away from the wall. The climber bring his center of gravity as low as he can as he's stretching the arms and looking at the hold at reach. He will need to exactly look at what area of the edge of the hold he would like to send his right hand to come into place. In this case, he's not doing any swinging to build momentum, but just lowers himself, applying pressure at the grips to pull himself forward towards the wall in order to commit to the leap. It's important the climber glances down at the feet, especially in the first position being moved where he will have to come out of the dyno. The climber places the right foot into a large hold where he can place half of the sole of his foot to surface against the hold. And this is a step up start so the climber will be pushing down onto that right foot to raise his hips off the ground and then will bring the left foot to come into place. Once the climber secures the feet placement then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

It doesn't seem like this is much better than grabbing it down here, but it is something different and I think that that's worth noting. So here we have the climber kind of in between two methods I would say. It's obvious that they could keep their hand here but they're leaving the hand and kind of halfway submitting to the jump and I would just say pick one you know if you're gonna try and span it try and span it if you're gonna try and jump then jump really hard and it kind of seems maybe like this climber stuck between two intentions.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As soon as the climber released the left foot from its place, he sends the leg to be extended. This is called flagging out. So the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. And it also helps the climber to keep in balance when releasing the right hand to bring it over to a match at the sloper hold. Now the climber sending both of the hands over the hold. He is pressing mostly the fingers against the hold to create friction and force to sustain himself towards the wall. And needs to continue to bring the elbows close to the wall in order to sustain the position. As the climber glances up, we can see his left leg going out into an extension. This is called flagging out and the climber extends the leg to maintain most pressure to be focused onto the right foot being in place. That way the climber keeping the leg extended helps him keep his right side towards the wall so his center of gravity is close onto the wall as he performs the stance of bringing the right hand over to the next hold. The climbers is turning at a one-hold start placing both of the hands in the same hole This is called matching and he's sustaining on to the hold as a pinch grip where he places the fingers above the Top edge of the hold and at the bottom he places the thumbs to then create extra gripping force By squeezing onto the hold to clamp down the move once the climber secures the grip he will be able to transfer the weight over to the grips by leaning back and Brings his left foot to come into position to push away from the hold in order to bring his center of gravity being on the core to a rise and The climber then eventually will bring the right foot to come into position onto the wall Once the climber is no longer standing in the mat, then the climb will start The climber doesn't look directly at the hold but instead looks down so he can focus on just applying friction over the hold by feel where he this time brings the outer area of the palms to press towards the hold in order to adjust the pressure. It's important the climber glances down at the feet, especially when making a foot switch. He's bringing his right foot to come into placement before releasing the left foot. Now, the climber, before doing the foot switch, he has brought his left hand to come into a sloper hold being cupped, where he needs to continue to remain underneath the hold or apply pressure by forcing a pull and keeping his elbow close to the wall. Once the climber was able to go up for the reach, he places the right hand to be open grip onto the lobe of the hold. This one placing as an open grip is important that the climber cups the hand to create friction between the fingertips being in place at the top of the hold. And once the climber secures the grip, he drops the weight onto the hold at reach. Quickly his right foot has come out of place and he has to engage onto tensing the core in order to pick up the feet. As we can see, also shifting his weight to be underneath his right hand placement and brings now his feet to be picked up to bring a high foot placement to be prepared for the next move. The clamber right now is applying chalk and it will help the clamber to spread the powder around the surface of his hands by the palms which will help him gain a better grip when sustaining onto the holds as well as absorbing any sweat that may be coming from his hands. If the climber was going to attempt this again, it's important that he lowers his center of gravity when sustaining to this type of hold as he was holding it pretty close to his chest and pulling it forcefully with the grips, copying onto the hold but forcing it out in order to apply pressure. The pressure was like pulling out of the wall in order to sustain the grip when he was standing over the hold when making the transition and in this case it's better if the climber lower his center of gravity to cup the hold being underneath from it so when he makes the foot transition of bringing the left foot into place he could slowly extend his right arm to quickly send the left hand over to the reach. The climber in keeping the left leg extended, he meant to push the toe against the wall, but it has slipped off as the rubber did not catch with the surface of the wall. And so he has brought the leg back up to push the toe against the wall and has been caught by a foot chip down below. This is called dabbing as this foothold is not part of his route and was used accidentally. Now the climber is going up for the move so he's probably not thinking about this right now but later on if it was to score points, this will lower his proficiency score. The climber is glancing down to perform a foot switch. In this instance, he's holding tight at the grips to release some of the pressure down at the feet and he's bringing his right foot to come into place above his left foot and once he pushes onto the left foot against the hold, he will hop out of the foot placement to come into a release and immediately apply the right toe to come into place at the foot hold. Swinging his arms helps the climber to release any tension that may be built up at his arms as well as warming up the shoulders.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He makes his first move. He's gripping his right toe with his left. Once he makes his first move and gets his left hand here, you can see he swaps to his right foot. This lets him have a point of contact on either side of his body, which will help him balance out a little bit. And then in this spot he gets a little higher and he goes to get his foot up, but it doesn't look like he really watches where he puts it. And it looks like he puts it in a bad spot and it just picks off and causes him to cut on the sloper and not be able to hold on. So just in the future you always want to look at your feet and make sure that you're placing them properly on the best part of the hold. You wouldn't want to blindly reach and grab a handhold. So you don't want to blindly step and stand on a foothold.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

You can kind of see it in their hand here. They are currently falling. And the reason for this is they're just pulling way too hard. You can see how tight they are on this hold. When that happens, you pull away from your feet. When your feet come off, it's very difficult to maintain that tension. And so here you have the foot pop and then the hands pop for the dry fire. So an equal distribution of force through the feet and the hands is very important. And I see a lot of the times with beginner climbers and also climbers that are more oriented towards being strong, this becomes a big problem. We think a lot about pulling with the upper body and not as much about pushing through the feet. And this is a good example of that. So here you have the climber in a setup move, right hand on the lateral brick pinch and left hand on this descending pinch here. You can see that they are backstep on what was the start foot. The climber goes up right hand into this two foot and just kind of smashes it. And obviously they are still on the wall, but it just doesn't need this much power. So throttling that down and maybe putting a little bit more work into the body position. When you pull too hard with your hands, well, we will see the result.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

However, it's important that his center of gravity stays underneath the hand placement. And when the center of gravity is being thrown away and not underneath his right hand placement, then it's most likely that his right hand will peel off from the hold. As we can see the climber has launched himself towards the wall and over to the direction of the hole that reach. This one being the dino we can see how his left foot was the one he pushed on forcefully and now has come out of contact with the wall. This helped the climber to gain direction and now the only places of contact are his left hand and right foot being on the large hole. Once the climber reaches his chest being on the same height as the grips, it's important that he pulls himself into the wall by bringing the chest towards the wall so that the climber when is in mid-air he stays underneath to the hole that reach. The climbers are starting at a two hand hold start. Both of them rounded with a hold in the middle. This is called a donut shape hold. So he places the fingers to come into the inside of the hold and place at the bottom area of it. Able to curl the fingertips inside of the hold as it has an opening groove where the climber can place the fingertips and tuck them in the inside. And then placing the surface of his palm at the bottom edge of the hold. As we can see the thumbs are placed on the outside. This will help the climber to apply extra gripping pressure by squeezing onto the hold and remaining in place. When sustaining the grips. Once the climber secures the grips he will be able to lean back to transfer over the weight. Now the climber's right foot is placed over the surface of the hold. This one being a large foot placement. The climber sends half of the front area of the foot to be surfaced against the top area of the hold. And this is a step up start. So the climber once places the left foot onto the wall and is no longer on the mat. Then the climb will start. If the climber attempted this again, there could be another approach for him to commit to this dynamic move. As the climber has the length of his arms from his left hand onto the dome and hold to the right hand up for the reach, he could potentially continue to keep his left hand in place once making the right hand placement. That way the climber can continue to bring his center of gravity close to the wall before pushing down on the right foot. This is one approach. Another approach would be that the climber continues to let his center of gravity be raised once bringing his chest towards the wall and then follow the jump at his direction on the launch. It was important that the climber does not press the foot prematurely as it sent his center of gravity away from the wall, having a very forceful swing for him to sustain the grip. The climber was able to make the hold that reach by pressing on the right foot going up for the boost. However, the right foot was engaged prematurely as we can see instead of following the direction of the jump, the climber is actually pushed away from the wall, throwing his center of gravity away from the wall. So the climber brings the right hand to come immediately into a slap above the hold and he must create friction between the skin and the hold by dropping the weight immediately. Now, it's going to be a matter of time as the climber doesn't have any contact with the wall and is going out for a swing, so the climber must engage into dropping the weight and sustaining the placement by tensing the upper area of the body to sustain the grip. The climber as soon as making all of the placements, he lowers his center of gravity and pushes on the right foot to start penduluming over his placements. Swinging over to left to right is to build momentum as he will need to come off onto a jump to the hole that reach. This is called the dino move. So the climber, while he no longer needs to think about the hand placements, he is just aiming by having eye contact to the hole that reach and must be focusing exactly in what area of the edge of the hole he will make the hand placement. Once the climber is ready, he will then swing hard over and push down on the left foot first in order to gain direction when going up for the jump.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Because what he wants to do is he wants to kind of launch up, get his hips close to the wall. Then when he's at the closest spot to the wall, spring from his feet to jump over to the green hold. As you can see, he's got the height on it, his hand is on the hold, but it does seem like his hips are a little further from the wall, so he wants to be probably just slightly closer to the wall and slightly higher. That way when he hits the hold, he's more in a bent arm position and can hold the swing.

Two pretty equal holds here, these old voodoo Waco jugs. Good platform foot for the right and decent push foot for the left. This climber is very long. I think that the span beta would work perfectly for them. They seem kind of caught in between these two methods. I always coach athletes to jump with everything that they have, especially in the early moves on a jump, because it's easier to throttle back than it is to throttle up. It's less intimidating in that way. So if you overshoot a dyno, it's usually a good thing.

Once the climber had made the left hand placement, which is in another pinch above, and he secures the grip, he's able to then drop the weight onto the grip and releases the left foot from its place, being all the way in extension, the climber releases the pressure transferring over the weight to the grip and the other areas of support that he has to bring the left foot onto a swing and now it becomes a flag where the climber now you sit to balance and stabilize himself The climber is ready to make the transition of the right hand over and we can see how he has pressed down the right foot, gaining slight height onto it and extending the left leg. Again, this is a flag so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the foot being in place. Right now, it's tapping against the wall so that he is able to force his direction when making the transition of his right hand over to the hold at reach. The climber in order to make the reach up for the pinch, he has done a foot switch below and extends the right leg to tap the toe against the wall. Again, this is a flag and the toe helps the climber to civilize him in order to, once he's achieving the move, to keep his left side towards the wall, as well as transferring over the weight to the left foot being in place. Helping with the climber going up for the reach and keeping his center of gravity close to the wall, he brings the left knee to be bended inwards and that helps the climber to keep his left side towards the wall and able to make the reach. As we can see, the climber is sending the left hand to come up in the pinch and instead he brings it with the hand going in and the thumb placed from underneath. This is so that the climber is able to pull on the hold with bringing the elbow over to the left side. As the way that he's gripping onto the hold right now, he will have to pull away from it onto the left side in order to sustain the grip due to the way that the hand is placed. It's important that the climber glances down when making a foot switch. The climber has a medium-sized hold, so he has a space for the right foot to come into place by bringing the toe area to surface the hold and apply pressure before releasing the left foot from its place. It's important that the climber always glances down when making the foot switch, which he already did and right now It's really pressing that toe Towards that hold in order to give it pressure as he is bringing his center of gravity away from the wall by sustaining on the grips and releasing Any tension that are building the arms which is extended so that he's only Applying pressure at the grips instead muscles that come from the forearm Not having the arms engaged this is called the wrist position So the climber is able to regenerate Strength whenever he needs to engage again into another pull up As the climber continues to glance over at the hold that reach, we can see him bringing his right foot to come into a match down below and also adjusting the grips to fit the fingers of his left hand onto the edge of the hold. As the climber will need to release the right hand over to the next hold. The climber brings the left hand to come at a match at the last hold and he is destabilizing his body in order to sustain it. Once the climber is able to demonstrate controlling the stability over the move, then the climb is completed. The climber brings the left foot at a high foot placement and quickly moves the left hand from the pinch hold. Due to engaging the arm for a long period of time, it would not be very sustainable for the climber and can tire the climber's ability to grip onto the hold of engaging the arm for a long time. So he brings quickly the left hand to come into a match at the jog. This is a large lip so the climber can now glance over to the next hold at reach. The climber was able to sustain to the hold that reached, this one being a positive grip, the climber is able to extend the arm to transfer over the weight and he glances down at the feet to do a foot switch. And this type of foot switch, the climber actually hops over the foot hold in order to bring the left toe into placement. So the hopping motion is that the climber for a slight fraction of a second is not connecting the feet by any means but jumps over the right foot out of its place to bring the left toe to come into place. The climber making hand gestures is studied around as he is visualizing the holds that he will encounter and approach it to know what kind of moves he will need to deliver. Once the climber on the flag brought over underneath the right foot placement, he was able to bring his center of gravity being on the core close to his areas of support. Risa and the climber then send the right hand to go up for the next move, this one being a larger pinch hold where the climber is wrapping the hand around the edge of the hold. Comparatively from the smaller pinch on his left hand which he needs to generate power by really closing on that grip. Think of a more clamping position but in this one the climber can sustain onto the right hand grip by leaning on it and for the climber to apply extra pressure when sustaining onto the grips in front of him he needs to continue to have the elbows bent to drop the weight and generate force and giving it pressure. The left leg continuing to be extended helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place and also helped him having the leg extended to balance over the two areas of support before in order to make the right hand up into the transition to the next move. The climber is doing a great extension and having a good use of his body awareness and this one the climber had placed the right foot at a high foot placement and As he continues to press that Foot or the toe against the hold we can see him bringing his right knee out This is so he can keep his center of gravity close to the wall by bringing the core inwards instead That way the climber can continue to push onto it as he had pressed on the left foot So that he can gain direction over his extension And what keeps him also close to the wall is he's engaging on a pull in Position by continuing to press on the right hand grip which he places it as a pinch So he is generating a lot of power with keeping that thumb on to the other side of the hold and really pulling himself In by bringing the chest towards the grip The climber had brought the right foot to come into a high foot placement and As the climber was pushing down on the right foot He transferred over the weight to it and releasing the left foot from its place as he's gaining height when making that reach now the climbers Right hand hold it's a jug so the climbers able to close the grip by wrapping the fingers around the lip of the hold in the other hand the left hand the climbers continuing to sustain on to the pinch and the only way that he can apply force in order to Bring himself Unto height is by pulling on the hold with the elbow out to the left side and due to the Hands positioning the climber is pulling himself up By pulling both of the elbows away from each other as He brings his left foot into a new foot placement The climber accidentally touching into a hold that's not on the route can come into effect on his performance. For example, this is called dabbing. So it's when he has a hold that was touched and potentially helped the climber when performing the move. Again, it's done when it's by accident. The climber was able to make the reach to a small pinch hold. So the climber instead of wrapping the entire hand, he's only pressing the fingertips against the hold since the edges are shallow. The application of the thumb is actually going to generate a lot of power onto that grip. As we can see on the left hand, the climber is holding onto a very shallow grip where he places the fingertips at the top of the hold. He's pressing onto it and giving it extra power onto the arm being bended as a pull up to transfer over the weight. This is called a crimp when you can see the knuckles sticking out. The climber is tucking in his thumb in order to apply pressure over to the fingertips. As the climber made the right hand going up for the reach, we saw his left foot coming out of place at the foot switch and extending the leg. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. As he needs to continue to bring his center of gravity close to the wall, he taps the toe against the wall to have a twist of the body going over to the right side to help with the reach. The climbers is starting at a sit start. Sit starts are usually difficult to come from and adds a grade to the climb. As we can see the climbers also starting on a one hold start where he places both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching. So he's matching the hands onto the hold as a pinch grip because he's able to place the thumbs on the other side where his fingers are placed to help to give gripping power when sustaining the hold. Once the climber places the feet onto the wall and raises the hips to transfer over the weight and is no longer in the mat then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here we have the climber starting on this lateral pinch hold and a left foot to the left of the body, so starting square into the wall. And after reaching out right to this jug pinch, the climber immediately relaxes. I think the boulder gets significantly easier after this. Gets this right foot and then maintaining tension through this left foot down here that they're leaving behind. They're able to cross up into this hold on the head wall.

He brings a hand placement to be open-handed so the climber can surface the palm towards the hold. He once makes the hand placement he immediately once comes off the wall he needs to apply weight by dropping underneath the hold. At this moment he had pushed on the right foot to boost the jump however his center of gravity wasn't quite aligned over the right foot so potentially being engaged early sending his center of gravity away from the wall and is not as close as when he first had engaged himself close to the wall with bringing his chest over. Now the climber must sustain the grip by creating a lot of friction power on pressing the fingertips and now since the climber is no longer on the wall in contact with the wall and only with the right hand being in place he must be going out on a swing but it's important that he keeps tension of the upper body in order to keep that center of gravity underneath his right hand grip. As the climber needs to generate momentum by swinging, before committing to the jump, he sends the left leg to come extended and push the foot against the wall. At this view we can see how the climber is holding onto the thinner area of the hold lip. This is called a jug or a bucket because this is an easy hold to grab onto once he gets to place the fingertips behind the edge of the hold rather than bringing it closer to the wall as it's thicker. So that was a good choice of the climber, aim to point over the middle area of the edge of the hold as it's thinner and the climber can create a closer grip to sustain it. Now if the climber attempted this again, it's important that when he keeps his chest towards the wall he needs to gain sufficient height to transfer over his center of gravity over to the right foot when being pushed down to boost the reach as well as making the hand placement in the right area to sustain the grip. The climbers are starting at a two hand hold start. These ones are shaped rounded and they are called donuts. As the climber is able to place the hand at the bottom and inside of the hold. As we can see, it's curled in the inside where there's a groove so the climber is able to place the fingertips inside the hold. Once the climber steps off the mat and is no longer standing with the mat, then the climb will start. The force of the swing was much greater than the climber trying to keep his right hand in place. This went on being in the motion of a swing sending his center of gravity away from being underneath his hand placement. As the climber needs to stop himself, he sends the feet down to the ground so now the climb is over. Also, it was to avoid so he doesn't fall on his face when the right hand peels off the hold. At this moment the climber is pushing the toe against the wall and will help the climber with gaining direction when making the reach. This is a dynamic move so the climber must create a lot of power on his stance not only for the direction but also to gain height to the hole that reach. This is called a dyno as he is generating a lot of power or enforcing his push and pull. Now the climber's chest is at the same height as the grips so it's important that he brings his chest towards the wall when going up for that direction that reach to remain underneath the hold. The climber is squeezing the grips but the thumbs placed on the outside of the hold helps the climber to gain better gripping power and we can see him extending the arms to transfer over the weight to the grips as well as both of the feet right now are in the same hold. This is called matching as the hold is large.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

But it seems like he's just jumping just far enough just to hit it. And so I think for this move, he wants to hit higher. So that way when he hits it, his arm can be bent. And he can kind of rotate around his shoulder and arm. Whereas when it's straight like this, his whole arm acts kind of like a lever. And so his whole body comes so much further out from the wall. So that way if he bends his arm, he can kind of have his body. He can still hold on and grip it and be able to hold it really tightly without his whole body swinging around.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This one is a jug so the climber would be able to secure the grip if he sent the left hand. However, his feet came in contact with the mat ending the climb. If the climber attempted this again, it's important that he can bring the left hand quickly as the center of gravity will be swinging away from the wall. To control his center of gravity to stay put underneath his area of support being at the grips above would be by tensing the body and engaging on the core while the feet will go out in a swing. Picking up the feet will help the climber also to not touch the mat. The climber without swinging he does a forceful push bringing him straight over to the hold at reach. This is called a dyno due to the hold being a distance and he has pushed on the right foot to boost on the jump, slightly throwing his center of gravity away from the wall so making that right hand placement immediately is necessary and this is a jug as the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the edge of the hold. With a thick lip the climber also must create friction when making the hand placement. As soon as the climber makes a hand placement he will immediately drop his weight onto the grip as the areas of contact he had before on the wall will no longer be in contact. In adjusting his center of gravity we can see the climber shifting his left hand to be placed over slightly to the left and this because the climber needed to transfer over the weight by extending the arms. So now the climber has brought the left knee to come inwards pivoting over the toe on the hold because the climber needs to continue to glance over at the holder reach this is called aiming as he will once gets himself position at the start holds he needs to continue to look at the hold at distance to then commit for the jump The climber makes the hand placement at the two-hold start, sending the left hand to the lower hold but also closer in distance from the dyno hold. Now places it in the top area in the inside of the hold by pressing the thumb on the outside to pinch onto the hold and the right hand is placed further away towards the left side in the bottom area of the hold again using the thumb to create gripping power. Now the climber is standing on the mat and the climb will start once the feet are on the wall and it's no longer standing on the mat. Now the climber's plan is to keep the left hand in place while he releases the right hand up for the reach. It's important that the climber in order to sustain the grip, he closes it to give it extra gripping power, but also needs to continue to keep his center of gravity underneath his right hand placement. Now it's a matter of time for the climber to control his swing as he's being pushed away from the wall and sending the left hand will help the climber to gain a better support with sustaining the grip. At this moment the climber places his feet onto the wall and lowers his center of gravity. This to transfer it over to the grips. When the climber is ready to commit for the dyno he will press hard onto the feet, mostly onto the left foot, so that he's able to gain direction over to the reach. And when engaging on the pull up he will bring his chest towards the wall so he can stay underneath the holder reach. technically because the climber has touched the mat on his first try then the climb is over. Now he's going for another attempt where he's now searching to place the hands with the right hand being over to the right hold in the left hand coming up for the top hold As the climber is chucking up his hands, he gets close to the wall to assess the reach. This one where he brings his left hand to come close to one of the start holes and the right hand to come close to the area reach which will be the dino hold. Since this is a large distance, the climber comes and standing up to check the distance, potentially wanting to change the way he's been approaching the wall. Thanks for watching! the climber twisting his center of gravity towards the wall onto his left side as he brought his left knee inwards. We can see his right foot had dropped from its placement, this one losing pressure due to applying sufficient pressure over to the left foot instead and bringing his body over to the wall over to the left. This could have been an intentional drop of the right foot or the climber decided to disengage from the climb as he was in position properly to commit for the dyno. He brings the left foot to come into place at the foot chip at the wall. Now the climb has started and he's pushing against that left foot towards the right side to keep his center of gravity over to the right because once he does not extend his left leg instead he will be swinging out to the left and will have to commit into a forceful push of the left foot to swing back out to the right this is called gaining momentum as he will then transfer over the weight to the right foot and also to the left hand being in place to release the right hand up for the dyno MacLymer is checking both of the initial holes, this one being donuts as they are shaped rounded with a hole in the inside. Placing the left hand, which is the one that will be staying on to the wall when making the reach, and places it towards the upper area of the hold so that he can cut the distance when making the reach.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So when he does swing back The lever isn't as long So there's not as much force and Weight further from his body swinging out so far and kind of pendulum out Just like that So here we can see on this attempt he's trying to switch up his hand positions by starting kind of crisscross. It lets him kind of undercling this hold. Theoretically kind of be able to stand up and kind of almost compress between these two holds. Instead of doing kind of a crazy jump over he's kind of able to just undercling and jump from there.

In this moment we can see how the climbers chest being close to the wall was supporting him not only for direction to stay underneath the hold but as well to try to bring his center of gravity along with it. But in this case the climbers right foot was engaged and we can see him being pushed away from the wall instead. The climber is ready for the jump in which he now is making his way over to the right side. We can see his left leg being extended. This is called flagging out. So the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start and once he places the feet from off the mat onto the wall then the climb starts. Both of the grips we can see that they are shaped rounded and with a hole on the inside where he places the fingers to go far in and into the groove curled into the hold to secure the grip. In order to sustain the grip the climber places the thumbs over on the outside to engage squeezing power to sustain the grips. Once the climber secures the grips he will be able to extend the arms to transfer over the weight and as for the feet we can see it being placed on a large hold down below where he places the toe box areas of the feet to surface the top area of the hold. The climber needs to make sure that when he is performing onto the jump, this is a powerful jump that keeps him underneath the hold. The right foot was engaged early, sending his center of gravity away from the wall instead, before the climber was even able to make the hand placement. Also, this was a poor jump where the climber's right hand wasn't even able to apply sufficient pressure as well as surfacing the hand over the hold. The climber on the leg being on a flag has quickly placed the left foot to be pushed against the wall. This will help the climber to give power over the jump when transferring over the way to the highest foot as well as helping the climber gain direction to continue to be underneath the hold at reach. Now the climbers chests are almost at the same height level with the grip so it's important that he engages into a close pull into the wall to bring the chest towards the wall. The climber engages on a swing to pendulum over his grips and pushing down at the feet. This is called building momentum so when the climber is ready to engage onto the jump he will then gain momentum over to the right to stand up over his foot placement as well as pulling himself in towards the wall. It's important that the climber continues to make eye contact with the hold at distance as he will be committing to a dyno move where he will need to bring the chest close to the wall when engaging on the pull up to stay underneath the hold at reach.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Trying to plant two feet on this hold. This is going to make generating a lot harder. This driving foot down left actually enables the hips to get over this foot and then they can spring up. But not having that drive foot kind of keeps these hips shifted to the left. So it's a bit counterintuitive even though this is a nice huge platform foot. The climber is incentivized to stay kind of tucked into the left there. And so generating up and right is going to be quite difficult. So you see at the last minute the climber bails on this left foot and ends up flagging out left anyway. And so keeping this drive foot down and left is definitely the right way to go. And here's another example of how the climber could commit to spanning the move. So it's really good to try different things. How you try different things is also important, but it is good to see the climber kind of investigating with different methods for this move.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

If he was going to attempt this again, it's important that he knows when he gains sufficient height where it aligns the center of gravity to be above the right foot placement in this one so that the climber doesn't push himself away from the wall. Also, he's a pretty large climber so he could potentially make the hand placement without engaging on the right foot and then dropping the foot in control to sustain eventually the swing to drop the weight. After the climber lowering his center of gravity, we can see how he's now engaging into a closed pull up. Sending over the feet to bring the knees towards the wall and immediately engaging on the arms so that he can bring his chest towards the wall. Once he has brought his body close to the wall, he will push down on the feet, leaving the left foot out of place potentially to push forcefully to send the climber over to the direction at reach. The climbers are starting at a two hand hold start. Each of the holds are called the donuts because the climber is able to place the hand inside of the hold. We can see how the right hand is more positive than the left hand. As the right hand is rounded, the climber can place the fingertips in the very inside of the hold and places the thumb on the outside of the hold to apply extra gripping power. With the left hand, we can see how it's flat on each side of the hold but the climber is able to also place the fingertips at the bottom of the hold in order to grip by curling the fingers into it. The climber was able to send the right hand for the placement being open-handed and he has to immediately create friction between the skin and the hold Immediately dropping weight to it as we can see the climber had boost himself on The push With the right foot, however, this was gained just slightly earlier as we can see his center of gravity being thrown away from the wall Now it's a matter of the climber sustaining the upper body to be tense So that he can continue to keep his center of gravity underneath his grip Otherwise the climber will be going out on a swing Potentially bringing his center of gravity away further and it's important for the climber to Have his grip drop the weight and if it's swinging out then he would potentially peel off from the hand placement Once the climber secures the grips, he brings the feet into a high foot placement, with the right foot being in a slightly large hold. Now this was a step up start, so the climber is no longer standing on the mat. Transferring over his center of gravity to the feet in place and holding onto the grips. As we can see, he's lowering his center of gravity by keeping the arms extended and now glancing over to a hold at reach. His reach is greater than the normal move at a stance, so the climber must jump into the hold in order to go up for the dyno, while continuing to make eye contact to the exact area of the edge of the hold where he will bring his hand into place.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Now another thing that also can help the climber is to make sure he gains sufficient height when at the jump before engaging on the right foot so he doesn't go out for a swing as forcefully when transferring over the weight to the right hand grip. And it was a good idea of the climber to send the left hand to come into support. We can see how the climber had engaged onto the pull up and his chest remains pretty close to the wall. This is because when he is already in mid-flight and has been pushed with the left foot to have direction over to the right side when at the reach, his center of gravity can follow the closeness of where he brought his body into the wall. Now as the climber makes the reach, he will gain more height in order to make the hand placement as well as being conscious of when gaining height and his center of gravity aligns over to the right foot placement and he will be able to push on the right foot to boost the jump. The climber brings the left foot to come into place at the same large hold. Now both feet on the same hold, this is called matching, and brings the right foot to be replaced towards the right side of that hold, still surfacing the shoe towards the top area of the hold. He does this intentionally to think about his movement as he will need to be committing into a dyno so whatever can get him close to the reach or be able to manage his body to when making his center of gravity go over the right foot placement. There are many other ways for the climber to also attempt this move as he could potentially keep one hand in place while making the reach of the right hand to control himself peeling off the wall while transferring the weight over to the high grip. Another option would be that the climber doesn't push forcefully on the right foot as he can make the reach initially having a very forceful push when making the jump and importantly that he picks up the feet and try to keep his center of gravity to remain underneath his grips. In the climber, wanting to make the left hand come into place, he wasn't able to do so, due to the climber's center of gravity swinging out forcefully and the climber has already put the right foot down on the mat meaning that the climb is over. The climber in swinging out and trying to keep his center of gravity underneath his grip, he sends the left hand to come into placement for support, as that will secure the climber's grip to sustain the swing. The climber is starting at a two-hand hold start and the climber is transferring over his weight to the grips once they are placed with the fingers being curled in onto the hold and applying the thumbs on the outside to help the climber to apply extra gripping force when sustaining onto the holds. The type of holds that he's sustaining right now is called donuts as they are shaped like one and he places it at the bottom area. Now the climb will start until his feet are no longer in the mat and right now he's making the right foot to come into a place into a large hold where he gets to place the front area of the shoe to surface onto the hold. As the climber made the right hand placement over to the jug, the climber is able to place the fingers behind the edge, this allowing for the climber to have more gripping power in order to secure the grip. However, the right foot was pressed down and send the climber's center of gravity away from the wall. It's important that the climber, while going out on a swing, continues to hang on tight to the right hand gripping in place, as he will be dropping his weight onto that grip. When the climber goes out on the swing, he needs to tense his upper body in order to keep his center of gravity below the grip. he's swinging to build momentum, pendling over his grips, he sends the left leg to be extended and have the toe push against the wall. Now this is an extra move that the climber is engaging to before committing onto the jump as he continuously looks up to the hole that reach which he will be committing into a dyno. Now the left leg extended pushing the toe against the wall will help him build power over the stance as gaining direction over to the right side and remaining underneath the hold. Now the climber to remain underneath the hold he needs to bring his chest forward once he reaches the same height of where his grips are. As the foothold is large, the climber has brought the left foot to come and join where the right foot is. This is called matching due to having sufficient surface to make the placement.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He actually looks like it's going to be a nice position. He's still pretty straight arm, but his lower body is more scrunched up to kind of break the lever as it swings back. And the next frame he actually gets both hands on. So we can see super close. He kind of gets a second hand on right at the last minute before his foot touches the ground or as it touches the ground. So I think again, the thing to make this go is he's got to aim for a hold past this. Cause right now it seems like he thinks the green hole this is the end of his reach. So he's only reaching to there. And what it's creating is this really long. So when he swings off his whole body is swinging in a straight line. So it's like a super long lever. Whereas if you could kind of like bend his arm and then bend his feet, he'd be like bending it like half the length. That's easier to control. And you would just be sitting up higher on the hole too. And taking it kind of locked off. Help him hold the swing too.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So a couple things, again, just jumping higher with both hands I think is a really good method for this dyno. And also just kind of recognizing that this climber is going to have to keep their feet up and commit to this backswing. A lot of climbers don't want to do this because you can end up face planting into the pads here, and that actually might be why this drag pad is back here. But nevertheless, it's a bit morbid, but sometimes in climbing we encourage folks to accept death, which is to say, don't worry about the consequences and just give a move everything that you have without any self-preservation involved. And oftentimes that is the safest way to climb, and the way to achieve a move is to let go of that self-preservation and just kind of go animal mode. And so I think that maybe the climber could use a little bit of that.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This is because he already had pushed forcefully on the foothold in order to gain direction over the jump. Now his chest is at the same height as the grips. At this moment the climber must engage into a close pull-up to bring his chest close to the wall, to drive his center of gravity close to the wall and remain underneath the hold of reach. As we can see the climber is lowering his center of gravity and keeping the arms extended so that he then commits to a dynamic move as he has to glance over at a hold at reach to perform a dyno. A dyno usually is known because he will have to push himself forcefully down at the feet and bring his center of gravity close to the wall when at the launch. Thank you for watching. As the climber had made the right hand placement, we can see that his right hand has peeled off from the grip being in place as he needed to create friction between the skin and the hold and continue to have his weight underneath his hand placement. However, the jump and the swing was much greater, throwing his center of gravity away from the wall. In this case, if the climber was going to attempt this again, it's important that he knows when to engage the right foot for the boost. As if he's going to boost it, he needs to gain some height up in the flight in order to have his center of gravity be lined up over the right foot in order to enhance the reach. The climber is starting at a two-hand hold start. Each of the holds, the climber places the fingers to come inside of the hold and place at the bottom edge of the donut hold. As it's rounded, the climber can place the fingertips all the way into the hold, which has a groove for the climber to have the fingertips catch inside of the hold. Now the climber applies the thumbs on the outside area of the grips, which will allow the climber to apply extra gripping power when sustaining the grips. As the climber send the right hand up for the reach, this one he applies it at the very tip of the rounded edge of the hold, sending it immediately on a placement of the fingers on the edge of the hold. And as he made the hand placement, we can see his right foot, right before making the hand placement, has been pushed with the right foot to boost the jump. However, he might have pushed it slightly earlier, in which we are seeing the climber sending his center of gravity away from the wall. Now it's important that the climber continues to tense the upper body in order to remain his center of gravity underneath the grip. As the climber makes eye contact with the hold at reach is to make sure that he's aiming exactly where his hand placement will be over the edge and at this moment as he continues to make the eye contact he's swinging over to pendulum over the grips and pushing down at the feet in order to create movement Once the climber is ready to commit for the reach He will then swing back and then push forcefully over to the right side To push down at the feet mainly on the left foot so he can gain direction over the reach The climber sends the right foot to come out of the mat and onto a large foot placement, and the left foot is also already applied on a foothold. Once the climber is no longer in the mat, then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So he should be able to stay on. I think the only thing that might help him is if he can get there a little faster, get there a little higher. Because right now it's like he's hitting it at the perfect arm height. So it's right at the edge of his reach. So maybe like, trying to like visualize something further. So that way when he hits it, he's hitting it more in a bent arm position. He can kind of take the swing more to the shoulder and arm instead of his whole body.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The climber definitely doing a good job at jumping out of the position, but they're just not quite high enough. Even though they are on the hold, if you hit it fully extended like this, it's going to be very difficult to hold the swing because this hold spills as you come around it.

Now the left leg had gone extended with the toe pointing down and this is called flagging out when the leg is into space to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. As the climber was making the reach he tapped the left toe against the wall so that he's able to stay in position between the left hand grip and the right foot and had brought his right knee to come inwards with the knee pointing down. This is called a drop knee as the climber needs to continue to gain height by pulling down on the grip and pushing down on the foot but also the climber needed to release steadily the right hand to go up for the next hold at reach. So in doing so the climber was able to stay in position and by the flag and the drop knee the climber is able to make the twist of his body over to the right side when making the reach. It's important how the climber manages his body when making the reach. In this case, he continued to keep his left foot in place at the block, as well as pulling tightly into locking his pull up to bring the grip close to his chest. This was necessary to keep also the flag to keep his left side towards the wall. As there is many other large holds in the way, keeping him away from the wall, so he needed to find a way to bring himself as close as he can to commit for the reach. The climber after securing the left hand grip, we can see him able to comfortably drop the weight over the hand placement and keeping the arm extended. That will help the climber to release some of the tension at the arm and not having it engage until he needs to perform the next move. This is called the rest position when the arm is extended and only relying on the grip. Now he's glancing down at the feet and it's important that he knows how to release that heel hook as heel hooks can be tricky since they provide a lot of power. If not released right, the climber could compromise his foot placement. So he brings the left toe to come into place at the edge of the hold and press against that hold to release the right heel hook from its place. The climber brings the right hand up for the reach and this is a block type of hold where it's flat at the top and flat to the right side of the hold. To get surface of the palm over the hold the climber brings the outer edge of the hand towards the wall and places the fingers above with the palm copying it over to the right side of the hold. As we can see he sends the thumb over it to apply extra gripping power by creating friction between the skin meeting the hold and now that friction he will find in a way to make a catch when applying weight onto the grip and closing the grip in order to give it extra pressure. Now it's important that when he engages on that arm he locks it by keeping the elbow close to the wall. After the match, the climber quickly placed the right foot to be pushed against the wall. By smearing the wall, means that the climber uses the rubber of the shoe to press and brush and catch against the wall so that he is able to transfer over his weight slightly to the left to help with the climber going up for the reach with the left hand up for the pinch. Now, this type of hold the climber is placing the thumb to one side and the fingers on the other and by squeezing the hold, this is called a pinch. As the climber glances down on making this switch, the climber brings the left foot to come into a high foot placement, placing it over the undercling hold. Now the climber has removed the thumb in order to allow space onto that toe to come apply pressure over the hold. The climber is struggling with applying the right pressure onto the open hand grip which he was cupping in order to close the grip and instead has sent the thumb to be placed at the bottom of the block. By placing the thumb, it only engages the grip in this instance as a clamping down position to secure the grip only using the forearm arm muscles. And that way, the climber could potentially lean back by not engaging on the entire arm. As we can see the climber keeps the left leg extended and pushes the toe against the wall. This is called flagging out and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. This will help the climber to gain civility over the move as well as supporting the climber's rotation of the body to keep his right side close to the wall. The same way that the climber had applied the right foot bringing the knee inwards and supporting the climber bringing the right side close to the wall helps the climber to keep his center of gravity close as well as making it easy for the climber to release the right hand to bring it over to a hold at reach. Once the climber was able to make the hold that reached, this one seemed to be a positive one, as the climber was able to place the fingertips behind an edge and quickly sense the right foot that was out in space, which was in the flag, to come into a match at the block down below. The climber sends the right foot from its place and extends the leg. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the hands and the foot being in place. And right now he's lowering his center of gravity while looking over at the next hold at reach. As this is a hold that is at distance, the climber must commit to a forceful pull up in order to make the reach. At this time the climber brought the right foot that was out in the air to come into a match at the block where their left foot was. This is so the climber is able to stabilize his body before committing to the next move. The climber wasn't able to apply sufficient pressure onto that right foot placement, the reason why the climber's leg has gone extended and he's swinging out slightly away from the wall. At this moment the climber is pressing harder onto that foot placement so that he can bring himself to pull himself in by bending the leg and soon sending the left leg out for an extension to bring his center of gravity close to the wall. As the climbers higher move is on the edge of the hold, this is a positive grip because the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the edge of the hold and can comfortably extend the arm not being engaged only on the grip. So in this case the climber sends the left foot that was out in space to come into a high foot placement. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start, both held differently. The right hand, he brings the hand over the edge of the hold. And this is a large jug so the climber can comfortably place the hand above that edge and sending the fingers behind the lip of the hold in order to pull it to apply weight onto the grip. The left hand, the climber brings with the hand coming from underneath. This is called an undercling as it's a jug that is placed upside down. And so he places the palm towards the edge of the hold and brings the fingers inside the hold. Now the way that the climber will be holding onto this grip would be by pulling away from the hold. And to sustain pressure, he will bring the elbow close to his core. Now once the climber brings the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing on the mat, then the climb will start. The climbers switched the heel hook to make a right toe placement over the edge where the left toe was. The climber was able to send the left hand up for the reach and places the hand open-handed Now this type of hold is a rounded hold. So this is called a sloper and he must create gripping power by Bringing the fingertips into the hold when the hand is spread out. This will help the climber to apply friction over the skin and the hold as well as bringing the palm into the hold to Sustain the fingers from sliding so just Like clawing it down and in order to sustain that hand grip He needs to bend the elbow and push it down keeping it underneath the hold in order to sustain pressure Now the climber because he was going up for this move being slightly dynamic as he pressed down on the heel To gain height we can see his left foot has come off the wall now this is With the leg being extended helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the heel hook being in place Before the climber sends the left hand to come into a match at a last hold, he brought the left foot to come into a high foot position so that he's able to stabilize his stance. Now both of the hands are in the last hold and he must demonstrate controlling the stability over sustaining the last hold at a match. Again it's important that the climber glances down at the feet especially when making a foot switch. During this time the climber is holding tight onto the grips in order to release some of the pressure down at the feet and the climber needs to continue to apply pressure down at the feet to not lose the foot placement. So he does by bringing the right toe to come into place and apply pressure onto the hold before releasing the left toe from its place. As the climbers left foot is a large hole the climber is able to press onto the hold and comfortably sustain With the right hand onto the hold even if he gets pushed away He's in their gravity away from the wall The hold that the climber will send the left hand outreach would be to come into a match at the same Lip this one being a feel of a jug or a giant bucket. We call it so The climber eventually Even if he has his leg extended is transferring over the way to the left foot being in place The climber after applying pressure on the left foot, he releases the right foot, bringing it over to the right side and into space with the leg extended. This is called flagging out and it helps the climber to transfer over the pressure to the highest foot being in place. As the climber needs to continue to keep his center of gravity underneath his right hand grip with the arm extended, he releases the left hand being on the undercling to easily transition from the outside area of the leg where it was placed to come into a match. We can see how the left hand's grip is pressed right now. So it is with a slight edge at the top where the climber presses the fingertips and is able to curl the fingers to sustain the grip. But to give it extra gripping power, the climber sends the thumb as a pinch down below, able to sustain with force when engaging on the pull up. Now the climber had swapped the feet and kept the right foot onto the block, sending the knee inward so the climber was able to bring his center of gravity close to the wall by shift in keeping the left leg extended helps the climber to shift over his right side towards the wall in order to release the right hand from its hand placement to make it over to the hold at reach. It's important the climber glances down at the feet. He had brought his left foot to come into place at the foot hold and rising his right foot off the mat he's no longer standing so the climb hasn't started. He's right now doing a match down below to do a foot switch so sustaining the grips during this time is important as he will need to release some of the pressure down at the feet in order to do the toe switch down at the foot chip.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And then on top of that, this is kind of the lowest position the climber does put himself in, so we can kind of see that he's essentially just sitting down straight underneath his arms while both of his legs are kind of with his left leg here and then his right leg over here, so both feet are kind of just on opposite sides of his arms, so he's essentially kind of in a squatting position, however this doesn't really allow the climber to get a full understanding of the movement that's required of him to complete this movement, so I would always encourage the climber to kind of allow himself to swing from side to side, so then that way he can feel the distribution of his body weight from his left foot to his right foot, and this way he can kind of get a better understanding of how to produce the power with his legs, because that should be the main driving force of this movement, it is going to be with his legs. And so here we can see the climber is committing to reaching up with his right hand up into this next handhold here. However, we can see a couple things right here. Obviously the right hand is already off the wall because it's going to be the first hand movement up into this greenhold. And then with this position as well, we can kind of see this is the one instance where both feet are now off the wall. And the one point of contact that's still on the wall is with his left arm and how much it's pulling. So this kind of shows to me how much the climber is kind of incorporating his upper body to be the main driving force in his dynamic movement here. However, every climber is kind of limited in how much power they can produce with their upper body. But you can always produce much more power with your legs. And especially in a dynamic move, you should always try and incorporate your legs as much as possible. So what I would encourage for this climber is to really try and allow himself to kind of continue to stay at least on that right foot just because that right foot is in a higher starting position. So really focusing on transferring his body weight over on that right foot and then jumping off of that right foot to really be the main driving force of committing to this dynamic move just because he is very limited on how much he can produce power with that left arm.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The grips are the ones that he has secured and keeping the arms extended helps the climber to recover for the meantime on his arm muscles before committing onto a pull up to the next move. The climber has engaged into a pull-up and now is extending the arms to build momentum to perform a dynamic move to the next hold at reach. The climber immediately after extending the leg he brought the left toe to come into a tap against the wall This is pushed so the climber is able to keep his center of gravity close to the wall Pulling him in while standing on the right foot and as we can see the climber was able to send the right hand over to the next hole that reach as we can see the climbers entry of The hold is over to the right side of the hold and the climber is able to Place the fingers inside the pocket area of the hole this one being a positive grip The climber was able to make the next hold that reached, this one being a jug. And once securing the grip, the climber leans back to transfer over the weight to the grip. And extending the arm again as a rest position. Now both of the arms being extended, the climber brought the left foot to come into place where the right foot is by bringing the ball of the foot towards the lip of the hold. Once the climber creates pressure onto the hold, the climber then releases the heel hook out of its place. Heel hooks need to be done with control when being released as they provide a lot of force and power onto the move. The climber was able to bring the left foot into a high foot placement to once applied the climber quickly places the left hand over to the next hold that reach and as we can see the right foot is not a much lower stance so in pressing both of the feet the climber is mostly keeping the left knee out to keep the hips square when making the reach. The climber is performing the start differently from the previous attempt. This time by pressing down on the right foot and bringing the right knee in. This is so that he's able to push down onto the left foot against the wall to raise the hips over to the right side. The climber in making the right hand up for the hold at reach, since this one was dynamic, the climber's right foot has lost pressure. This is due to the climber not pressing down enough onto the right foot placement. Due to this, the climber has slipped off from the hold and landed on the mat, ending the climb. The climber quickly had glanced down at the feet, this to bring the right toe to come into place at the edge of the hold before releasing the left foot, and quickly brings the right hand over to a match at the jug. The climber had brought the left foot to come into a match where the right foot was to then once applied pressure the climber transferred over the left hand to the next hold at reach also coming to a match at the hold. Matching is when both of the limbs are in the same hold. The climber then had brought the left toe to come into a match at the jug where his right foot is. Once securing the foot placement, he then brings the left hand over to the orange hold on a match, also placing the fingers behind the lips of the hold. This one's being positive grips as they are jugs and is able to press the thumbs on the outside of the hold in order to secure the grip. The climber bringing the left hand over to a match where his right hand is. This one with the entry over to the right side, the climber needs to create a pull or lay back to the left side of the grip. Reason why the climber is bringing the elbow to be pointed out over to the left side. As the climber is pushing down onto the right foot, he's gaining height and continues to pull into the grips by keeping the elbows out. In doing so, when the climber was gaining height and had secured the grips, he dropped the left foot and now is keeping the left leg extended. This is called flagging out, so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. And at this moment, the climber keeping the left leg extended also helps the climber with having a stability while performing the next move. The climber is able to make a high foot placement over the jug and quickly sense the left toe to come into place as well. Now matching the feet. As we can see the climber is bringing the left knee to come inwards. This is so that he is able to keep his left side of the body towards the wall as he will have to release the left hand over to the next hold at reach. The climber was glancing down at the feet to perform a new foot placement. First, I brought the left toe to come into place where the right toe was. And once the climber applied pressure of the left toe coming into the hold, then he was able to release the right foot. And this time he's bringing the right foot into a higher foot stance, placing the hold, placing the foot over the hold. The climber had performed this dynamically by lowering his center of gravity and quickly engaging onto a forceful pull and push at the foot. This one's being his main areas of support. After the climber had gained a certain height, the climber continues to keep the pull up close to his chest. This is called a lock off. And that way the climber quickly sends the right hand up to the next holder reach. The climbers are starting at a sit start and sit starts are known to add a grade of difficulty to the climb. This is because the climber will have to bring the weight onto the placements. And what he's right now sustaining to is at a two-hand hold start. And the climber is now placing the feet onto the wall. Once the climber gets to lift the hips off the mat and is no longer sitting on the mat, then the climb will start. The climber had brought the right toe over the hold where he was placing the heel hook. Once applying pressure to it, the climber drops the left foot from its place. And as we can see, keeping the drop is so the climber can keep the hips square and transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. Quickly the climber then sends the right hand over to the jug, now matching at the hold. The climber had performed another foot switch by placing the left toe over the hold and releasing the right foot to bring it at a high foot placement. This time the climber is applying a foot technique that's called the heel hook. So he's sending the heel into the wall and places the heel behind the lip of the hold. This is so the climber is able to jam the heel between the hold and the wall. Now the application for the heel hook is important that he makes sure he secures the foot placement. And when used, the climber can use it almost as a third hand where he can pull on the heel towards him to bring his center of gravity close to the wall. And also when performing to a hold that reach, he can pull in as well as pressing down onto the hold in order to gain height. Once the climber is securing the right hand grip, he's able to lean back to transfer over the weight to the right hand grip. Quickly, the climber continues to keep his center of gravity underneath the right hand grip to send the left hand above the right hand placement. Now, both of the hands come into a match at the hold. The climber, since he's sustaining to the last hold, he must demonstrate control and stability over the match as well as his body position. If the climber is able to demonstrate this, then he has completed the climb. As we can see the climber has sent the right hand up to the hold that reached this one being a jug and is able to wrap the hand around the lip of the hold and for the form in order for him to make the reach he Kept the left leg to be extended. This is called a flag So the climber is able to transfer over the way to the right foot and being in place and to keep balance and the stability over the move. As we can see the climbers also keeping his right side of the body towards the wall reason why he had brought the right knee to come inwards when performing the stance and by pushing the left toe against the wall helps the climber with the twist of his body when performing the reach The climber was able to send the right hand over to a jug. This one is a positive grip so the climber, once wrapping the hand around the lip of the hold and extending the arm, he can then drop the weight to the grip. Now the climber is slightly leaning back to bring the left foot over to where the right foot is to perform a foot switch. Once the climber applies pressure onto the left toe coming into place, he will be able to release the right foot. The climber seems to be given a chance to try the climb again. So in this attempt the climber is again starting at a sit start and getting himself positioned. It is important that the climber widens up the stance. In this instance the climber is bringing the left toe to come into place at another jug that is slightly at distance to the left. Once securing the toe placement, the climber applies pressure and the climber then leans over to the right side to make the transition of the right hand over to the last hold. The climber was able to make the next hold at reach. This one going up for a jug as the climber is able to wrap the hand around the lip of the hold. And as we can see the climber was able to press down onto the right foot to transfer over the weight to the placements and keeps the left leg extended. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place and to boost the stance the climber pushes the toe against the wall. This helps the climber to have a stability on bringing his center of gravity close to the wall and balance over the move when performing the reach.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So it's not really like probably aiding himself going up the wall. What it is doing is kind of letting up tension down and pulling down what his feel at. That's a big hold in where it's positioned. I think it's keeping his hips close to the wall. And so while it's like in the immediate, you know, in the next couple moves maybe he'll switch it to a toe to get set up for the next move. It's like a, it's not a bad way to keep that tension and utilize a big hold and utilize your heel so you're not pushing down having to toe into everything. So here we can see him starting. He does a good job getting opposite pose. He's got his right leg on, left arm on. But the important part is seeing how he twists his hip in. So he's really doing this nice twist lock. He's really turning his torso into his forearm and bicep. Now really getting that weight over his foot. This left leg is staying really nice and rigid and tense, smearing into the wall, providing that tension. He can kind of smear down into it and it's gonna kind of drive him up into the right. But he's doing a really good job kind of twisting in and becoming really stable and tense. And that's gonna let him really suck into the wall and really drive himself up the wall. Then we can see he's about to do this big move up to this yellow hold. And instead of kind of just yanking his arms up and trying to pull up and jump to it, he really re-situates his feet and gets his feet into the best position so he can really drive up and really tension down on those legs and really get that power coming from not only his arms but his feet as well. And that the feet are going to be so much more powerful than his arms are. And then immediately once he makes that move, he does a good job just relaxing out. He's still tense and he's still tensioned. But then he immediately kind of just looks down, finds his feet, walks his feet through to then set himself up in the next position for the next move.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So in this position he is hanging on with the left hand here, as well as utilizing this right foot. So again he's using those opposite points of contact, and in this case he's transferring his bodyweight over that right foot. But we can see there's more of a preference with this left arm by pulling and getting himself over into the direction that he needs to. So again, this could just be the Clamor's preference of being comfortable with pulling on a lot of these moves, just because they are on jug holds, which are the good and friendly holds that a lot of people like to hang onto. But on more difficult climbs, if the Clamor has the same preference, it could make it a little bit more difficult, especially when they're on smaller handholds or more difficult handholds. So I would always encourage Clamor's to train with good technique and good habits, even on the easier climbs, so then that way those good habits can kind of translate into harder climbs as well. And so here we can see that the climber was able to move his left hand over into this next hand hold here So in this position the climber is hanging on with the right hand here And then he was able to keep a low left foot and he did decide to place a higher right heel hook um, so in this position, this does kind of keep both of his feet separated so that his Hand contact is in the middle of those two points and what this does is it helps to lock his body into a really good and balanced position And then as we can see the move the climber moving into that left hand He immediately goes into a very straight arm position as he tries to identify where his next hand hold is So this is a really good thing to see from the climber by ensuring that his arms are in a relaxed state Being in a straight position here I mean allowing his legs to take the majority of his body weight because they're now in a bent position With a bent left leg and a right heel hook. So this is a good thing to see from the climber So here we can see that Claremont was able to make the first move of bringing his right hand up into this next handhold here. So in this position he is hanging on with a left hand here, as well as utilizing a right foot directly underneath his hand. So because he's using two points of contact that are opposite from each other and they are kind of lined up with each other, this does allow him to get into what we'd consider a backstep move. So in this backstep move it does utilize your legs a little bit more to be the driving force of pulling yourself up into the next move. So what we can see is that the climber is allowing his right knee to be pointed over to the left. And then on top of that he is flagging with a good left flagging foot, also going out to the left. And this helps to kind of rotate his body so that the right side of his body is getting closer to the wall. So then that way it kind of promotes the right hand in the direction that it wants to go to. However, on top of that we can see that the climber is pulling in quite a bit with his left arm. It's also to kind of really get that rotation going on. But this does kind of show that the climber has a preference to kind of pulling in with his upper body, which doesn't always mean a bad thing, but it could just be this climber's preference on pulling a little bit more, probably just because it's his strong suit and so he's willing to do that. And so here we can see the clamber was able to move his right hand over into this final hold here So in this position he is hanging on with the left hand here and then he now has two feet Which is right foot there as well as a left foot there. So this is a very simple position however what we can see is the clamber is kind of allowing himself to be more in a straight arm position as He's completing this movements here And now he's encouraging his legs to be in a little bit more of a bent position or kind of pushing himself over in the direction So this is a much better thing to see because now at that point he's no longer using Pulling energy on his upper body. He's now relying on his legs to kind of control his body weight and where it needs to go And so here we can see the Clamor was able to make the next move of bringing his right hand up into this next handhold. So in this position he is hanging on with the left hand here, and then behind his body he does have a high right foot. So again because he's using opposite points of contact it is really smart of the Clamor to go up with his right hand. So then that way his left hand and right foot are able to stabilize his bodyweight between those two points. And so that's exactly what we see going on right there. And then another good thing that the Clamor is able to utilize here is a proper left flagging foot, kind of going in a downwards position. And what this does is it helps to allow the Clamor to really rotate and pivot mainly around that right foot. So that he can not only bring the right side of his hip closer to the wall, but so that he can also stabilize around his left shoulder. So then that way he can kind of continue a rotation around those points and further allowing the right side of his body to get closer to the wall. So this does demonstrate that the Clamor is a little bit power oriented and is willing to pull with his upper body. But he's also demonstrating a good technique with his legs by allowing his lower body to rotate as well. And so here we can see the clamber was able to move his left hand up into this next handhold here I'm so in this position He is still hanging on with the right hand behind his arm there And then on top of that he is able to utilize a left foot on this higher position here I'm so again because these are opposite points of contact, but now they're separated from each other This does allow him to keep his body more centralized between those two points And so all the clamber has to do is to really transfer his body weight over that left foot So then that way his left foot can be again the main driving force of pushing himself up into this next movement here It is hard to say exactly what's going on with his right arm just because we can't see it in either image But we can kind of focus that the clamber is utilizing his leg his left leg in this point to really be a good Source of power for his movement here", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They are going from a big hold to a very big hold So just pressing off the right leg is enough to create the momentum They need to catch this but they really want to find the left foot position and as a result They just waste a lot of energy hanging and looking for the foot So, climbers moving through relatively smooth enough. It's an easy grade for them, so they're able to hang on without as much effort. However, we see their body kind of swaying and rotating quite a bit as they pull through each move and switch positions. They're just not really in control of the momentum or body positioning. So, they're able to pull through because the holds are big for them, but they're not moving their body very efficiently. So climber begins the attempt, but their foot immediately hits the ground here, and that counts as a fall. So this is now technically going to go into a second attempt for the climber. They always see a climber eventually when they're willing to commit to it. It's not that bad of a move. They catch it without the foot even cutting. Good placement of the right heel to engage and keep center of balance as they move the left hand up here. So we see the climber kind of unsure of how to position their hips for this first move. They go back and forth between opening the right hip to the right side and then turning the hip in towards the left, opting at the last moment to go with the drop knee position, which is usually the more efficient way to reach with the same side of the body.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Pretty sure this hold has been on for other climbers, I could be mistaken, but nevertheless the climber is able to go up high and gain this hold here. Climber then matches this lower hold, builds the left foot up onto the start hold, and goes up left hand into this jug here. Alright, so this is the second attempt from this climber in this video, which is kind of peculiar. Yeah, technically that should have been their attempt, but here they are. They had fully gotten off the ground and were into the boulder on this hold and dropped off. So we will start attempt number two. And after matching this hole on the headwall, the climber keeps their right foot in this midway jug and just kind of surfs through the headwall to the match hole, which you can see they are on now for the send. And after matching this lower jug, the climber was able to go up and left into this jug here and just continue kind of surfing through these jugs. And driving off the right foot, the climber is able to stand up tall, right hand into this jug here, keep the foot on. Most of this is because the climber is pulling the hips, pulling out away from this hold and keeping the hips in the wall, which allows the climber to drive this right leg into the foot and maintain core tension on the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

A positive hold, this one because the climber is able to place the ball of the foot above the edge of the hold. And it's positive because it's a big foothold. Now we can see for the start, the climber continues to keep pressure onto that heel hook and it keeps him close to the wall at this instance. Once the climber gets to secure the right foot placement, then he will be able to release the heel hook from its place. Heel hooks are known to also be tricky to take off so it must be done with control. The climber is engaging onto small pull-ups. This is so that he can release some of the pressure at the grips to readjust him. The climber sends the left hand up to the next hold that reach coming into a match matching is when both of the hands are into the same hold and this one seems to be a small jog as the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold and As we can see he had done the performance of sending the left hand up after The foot switch or at this moment the climber potentially is keeping his right leg Extended to transfer over the way to the left foot being in place As the climber glances to the next hold at reach, he needs to continue to keep his center of gravity as much as he can close to the wall. And before committing to the next move at reach, he's extending the arms. This is a moment for him to recover on his arm muscles as they have been engaged. And whenever he's ready, he will engage into a very close pull up and gain momentum when performing the move. As we can see the climber has started to climb because he got his feet positioned onto the wall and is no longer sitting on the mat as the climber has Then pull himself on a pull-up to come out of the start as well as pushing down onto the heel hook that's the outer area of the heel towards the hold helps the climber to Then be pressed to raise the hips and the climbers keeping the right leg extended This is called flagging out or back flagging in this instance because it's folded behind the left foot The back flagging is helping helping the climber with gaining more stability and balance or his main areas of support And when the climber is raising the hips he can keep his left side of the body towards the wall As we can see the climber is starting at a one hold start where he's placing both of the hands with the left hand over the right hand to hook the grip and create pressure of the hands one on top of the other. The climber then can try to keep a more secure grip over the hold. As we can see when both of the hands are into the same hold this is called matching and the climbers is starting at a sit position. Sit starts usually are known to add a grade to the climb so it's because the climber will have to raise the hips once he has all of his placements onto the wall. As we can see the climber was able to make the next move at reach and this one doing it is slightly dynamic once committing into the pull to commit into the move. Now his main areas of support in that move were his left side, left hand and left foot and once engaged the climber then had kept the right leg extended which is flagging out so that he can keep his hips square towards the wall to keep transferring the weight to the left foot being in place. The left foot when being engaged helps the climber regaining height. Same thing with the left hand grip when he's pulling down. What keeps the climber center of gravity close to the wall to feel a pull into the wall is the climber tapping the right toe towards the wall when committing to the reach. The climber once securing the heel placement, he then brings the hips closer to the wall sending the knee out. This is because the climber is no longer going to be pulling with the outer area of the heel towards the hold but instead push down onto the hold when making the next move. The climber after securing the left hand grip, we can see how he's glancing down. This to make sure that he is repositioning the heel hook or making sure that the heel hook is staying in place. As the move that he just performed, the climber was using the outer area of the heel to be pressed against the hold in a pulling motion so that he was able to bring his center of gravity close to the wall when performing the move. As the climber is continuing to glance up to the next hold that reaches in his grips, he has performed a foot switch over the large hold. He does this blindly because he's able to feel the large hold when making the switch by first bringing the right foot to come into place at the hold, create pressure before releasing the left foot from its place. The climber right now is reaching out for the chalk bag. It's a type of powder that the climber will be using to spread it on his palms to absorb any moisture that may be coming from his hands as well as gaining a better grip before starting the climb. The climber keeping the arms extended. This is a wrist position because the climber at this time can regenerate on his arm muscles because they're not engaged. And at this moment he's instead transferring his strength over to the grips before committing to the next move at reach where he will have to bend the arms. The climbers glancing down at the feet and he's performing a jump off jump on foot switch method where he brings the left foot to come almost into place and is Jumping over the hold to remove the right foot from its place and immediately when the climber Takes the right foot out then he will Bring the left foot to come into place immediately onto the hold Sometimes this is not the most accurate way of making a foot placement since he's not feeling the hold first But because it's a large hold it works You can take a fair bit of energy onto the grips as the climber is releasing some of the pressure during The moment that the climber is not touching the hold As we can see the climber was able to send the left hand out to the next hold being a jug as a climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold and had engaged into a very close pull up. As we can see the right hand the climber is continuing to hook onto the hold by bringing it close to his chest. So once a climber gets to place the left hand and secures it and he will be able to transfer over the weight to the grip. As the climber was committed to make the next move at reach, he has run out of time and right now is intentionally dismounting from the wall. As we can see the climber is making the left foot placement by bringing it at a high stance for later to place weight onto the foothold. He's bringing the heel to go into the wall first and to be the outer area of the heel to touch the lip of the hold. This is called a heel hook where the climber then could use for gaining stability and bringing his center of gravity close to the wall once he brings the knee inwards. Heel hooks are known to be strong because the climber could go for one big powerful move later on after positioning the right foot or moving through a series of moves a distance from the foothold. Now for the heel hook the climber can also apply a motion of pulling as well as pushing down in order to make the application. The climber shaking the hands is to release any tension that has been built up as well as warming them up before starting to climb.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It just seems like he pulls in and kind of thrusts with his upper body. So he kind of looks like he's kind of not fully getting into the right positions. It kind of seems like he kind of gets his lower body in position and then pulls with his upper body so it doesn't kind of feel fluid. Like he should kind of be coordinating his lower body and his upper body at the same time.

So he just keeps his hips far from the wall and takes the movement back to his upper body once again. Same here, it's like he almost commits too much to this kind of hip position where he's rocked over his foot And he hasn't left him any room to kind of spring up from his lower body So all springing has to kind of do from his arm. So it's almost like it's like a one two instead of a good That just feels like kind of choppy a little bit It's almost like he's trying to get into these positions too far.

And in this position we can see that the climber is hanging on with the right hand behind his head right here. And then he is utilizing a left heel hook on the starting foothold right here. So because he's using opposite points of contact, which is his right hand and left foot, this does allow him to get really good control of his bodyweight between those two points. So much that he can rock his bodyweight over on top of that left heel hook. So that way he can try and utilize his left foot a little bit more to help with his bodyweight. However, what we can see is that as soon as the climber does grab on to that left handhold, he does immediately go into this very flexed position here. So by going into this flexed position where his arm is pulling up into the handhold here, that's encouraging the use of his upper body for this movement. And the same thing can be said right before committing to this move. We can kind of see the climber pulling into the handhold and then reaching out to that left hand. However, by continuing to use this positioning, where he's pulling in with his arms and then moving into the next position and then automatically pulling again, this does use up a lot of energy on his upper body. So it can be hard to complete a boulder tune-up in this fashion, just because it can cause your upper body to get very tired very quickly. So I would always encourage climbers to try and make sure they have their arms as straight as possible, as often as possible, so that way they can conserve that energy in their upper body and utilize their lower body a little bit more. And so here we can see the clamor was able to make the next move of bringing his right hand up into the next handhold here And in this position we can see that the clamor was using a left hand here And then he is still utilizing the same left foot that he started with in the beginning of the boulder And so because he's using two points of contact that are on the same side of each other This does naturally cause an imbalance in his position where his body wants to rotate around those two points So essentially his body wants to rotate out and to the left from the wall So this does make it a little bit harder for the clamor to try and control that just because there's a lot of momentum Taking him in the opposite direction that he needs to go So in order to kind of compensate for that we can see the clamor is doing a couple of things One of which is going to be this right flagging foot that's going out and to the left And by flagging this foot out and to the left It does help distribute some of his body weight over to the left side of those two contacts that he has which is his left Hand and left foot so this helps to prevent a little bit of the swinging that his body wants to take place But then on top of that in order to keep his body over to the right We do see that the clamor is having to pull in Really hard with his left hand here and that's to kind of engage his body to keep it over into the rightward Direction that he wants to go towards Um, so again, we can kind of see that this clamor is incorporating a lot of upper body usage in order to complete his movement here So again, this is using up a lot of energy very quickly So I would definitely encourage this clamor to kind of utilize his footwork a little bit more So then that way he can kind of emphasize on his legs Creating the power that he needs to get up on this boulder as opposed to his upper body which could make him very tired very quickly", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

However, based on their movement style and pattern, it looks like they may struggle a bit with this for how much they're pumping on each hold. Same thing here. We see they're like a little hesitant to engage that heel hook really well So they have to kind of pump a few times into this move They eventually do commit to doing it and they still catch the hold but again, those pumps are inefficient. They take up energy So we see the climber begin by sequencing some of the moves on the problem. You can watch them kind of pantomiming the movement on the right side of the screen, anticipating the positions their hands are going to need to be as they hit different holds. The more the climber does this on the ground, the more efficient they're able to be when they're climbing on the problem. We see it happen a third time here when the climber matches and each time they pump again So they're really hesitant about trusting the first position of the move good exercise for them would be to really use the holds However, they first touch them and just immediately need to move through So the heel placement was good as they pulled into the hold, but as they begin to reach over, they let their heel or their knee kind of lean out to the outside and left. They're not engaging the heel hook nearly as much as they pull in on it, and that makes this first move a little less controlled. They're able to still catch the next hold, but it's less controlled and it takes up excess energy.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It seems that maybe they're unaware that this mono is on. Nevertheless, they time out and the climber steps off the boulder. And here we have the climber in this starting position. See they're just fully wrapped on this protruding hold. Instead of grabbing it front facing, they're holding it almost like a cradle. That's fairly common with holds like this, and they're also starting in this deep heel hook. So, a fairly comfortable starting position for the climber. Climber then goes out left into this Gaston jug and keeping the perch in the left heel here, the climber just locks off this left arm and is able to reach up into the target hold here. It's probably a better technique to switch the feet here, but the climber is very strong and can overcome worse technique with strength and that strength is in and of itself kind of a technique, but it does tend to limit climbers as moves get hyper technical.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This is because when releasing the left foot from its place to transfer over the weight to the right foot that has come into a high foot placement, he keeps body tension to control the move. And as we can see with his left hand, he's keeping the elbow close to the wall to sustain the grip as he continues to pull on a tight pinch for the right hand. The climbers is struggling and keeping the grips at the match. This is because the climber must apply pressure on pulling on the direction over to the right side as the entry of the hold is over on the left side. The climber had made a right foot placement and being on a wide stance, once the climber was able to secure the foot placement, he releases the left foot and as we can see, sends the left foot pointing out to the right side and keeping the left leg extended. This is called back flagging because the climber is folding it behind the right foot. And this is so the climber is able to bring his center of gravity close to his areas of support as he will eventually remove the left hand from its place to make the move to the next holder reach. The climber continues to keep the left leg extended. This is called flagging out. So the climber was able to transfer over the way to the right foot being in place and had brought it close to the wall. So the climber was able to pull himself in and sending the right hand over to the next holder reach. He has performed the move at reach, this one being a wide pinch that is sloped and pointed down. So the climber must bring the left hand as far in and applies the thumb from underneath to squeeze onto the hold. As we can see the climber placing the hand as far in so that he has contact of the skin to surface the hold so that he is able to apply friction of the skin catching towards the pores of the hold. And the climber closing the grip then he will be able to apply pressure and pull onto the hold to place his weight immediately to the grip. Now in order for the climber to bring his center of gravity towards the wall or help the rotation was done by the right toe pushed against the wall when performing the reach. The climber eventually have brought the right toe above the heel and once the climber releases the heel hook from its place the climbers then toe rolls in top of the hold. The climber then immediately will be able to secure the foot placement as soon as he applies pressure to it. The climber making the left foot application, he brought the heel to come in contact over the flat surface of the hold and had pressed the outer edge of the heel towards the top surface of the hold. And that helped the climber to bring his center of gravity close to the wall. As we can see the climber's right foot when it was engaged on pressing onto the hold down below, it was so the climber was able to gain height as well as direction to make the hold that reach. And the climber brings the left hand to the next move on the climb by placing the fingers onto one side and the thumb onto the other. Then the climber will be able to secure the grip by squeezing onto the hold. This type of hand placement is called a pinch. The climber had spent about four different foot positionings before performing this move at reach. And as we can see the climber was able to extend the right leg and immediately pushes the toe against the wall to then commit into pressing onto the left toe placement and pulling on his right hand to commit on the wave bringing the left hand over to the hold at reach. The climber pressing the toe was so that he can engage on bringing his center of gravity being in the core close to the wall. The climber was able to make the application of the right foot at a high foot placement and quickly removes the left hand to bring it over to the hold next to it. This one is a smaller hold so the climber can engage into closing the grip. This one gives the climber a longer time to sustain the hold rather than sustaining to the large hold at an open grip. So the climber in this instance is applying a pinch form grip where he's using the ball of the hand and pressing the fingers onto the other side. He is creating pressure by squeezing onto the hold and must keep the elbow close to the wall in order to sustain pressure and placement of the grip. The climber brought the right leg to be extended. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. Flagging helps the climber to gain a stability and balance when performing the move and as we can see the climber brought the left knee to come inwards so the climber is able to keep his left side of the body towards the wall when performing the reach. The climber is now getting himself positioned for the third time to perform the next move. This time he had the right foot over to the right side and placed while he was on the back flag and instead drops the right foot from its place, engages into the core to pick up the feet and rotating the hips to bring the right foot to come into place over to the left side. And once the climber gets to apply the right foot placement then he will get himself set for the next move at reach. The climber bumps up for the next hold at reach. Initially he had placed the right hand over to a green hold that was placed open-handed and that's not the best hold so the climber when gaining height pushes into the left toe towards the wall so the climber can make a consecutive move over to the next hold at reach. the climber drops the left foot from being at a high foot placement and instead glances down to perform a foot switch the type of foot switch technique that he is applying is called a magician's tablecloth because the climber places the left toe over the right toe in the moment that the climber pulls out the right foot from its place the climber then will drop the left heel in order to make the placement of the toe over the hold this can take a fair bit of energy because he could accidentally pull the toe coming into place at the hold by accident The climber this time has secured the hand placements and leans back to extend the arms. This was for the climber to allow the left foot coming into a high foot placement. The climber when engaging into that high foot placement eventually he would have to push against the hold in order to transfer over the weight to the highest foot when releasing the right foot from its place. It was in the point that the climber had pressed the right toe with the leg being on a flag so that he can bring his center of gravity close to his main areas of support when releasing the left hand over when committing into the dynamic move. Now the climber in securing the left hand placement he was able to drop his weight by extending the arm and now he is glancing down to make a placement of his right foot over to the next hold. The climber is performing a foot switch at this moment, however he has limited visibility and he does this by feel. Bringing the left toe over to a match at the small foot chip and the climber is swiveling out the right toe from its place. This is so the climber can give some space for the left toe coming into place. Once the climber gets to apply pressure of the outer edge of the toe, he then pulls out the right toe from its place and immediately rolls the left toe above the foot chip. This type of switching method is the most accurate and more energy efficient as the climber is consistently applying pressure onto the foot placement. The climber walks the hands over to the right edge of the hold. This is so the climber is able to keep his right hand placement close to his area of reach and securing the left hand coming into place. As we can see the climber glands down at the feet and because he's performing a foot switch, this one bringing the outer edge of the right toe towards the hold and once applying pressure the climber then removes the left foot from its place and the climber then rolls the right toe over the hold. The climber in pushing the left foot out of its place now. He keeps the left leg extended This is called flagging out so the climbers able to transfer over the way to the right foot being in place and the climber is bringing the Right knee in words so that he can keep his right side of the body close to the wall as he had just landed he's right hand over to this green hold that is placed with the grip open-handed where the climber places the fingers above the hold and Brings the palm close to the hold in order to sustain the grip having to create friction and the climber will Have to remain underneath the hold in order to sustain the grip The climber when securing the right toe placement onto the hold he rotates the knee to be placed above the foot placement. This is so the climber is able to apply pressure to the foot coming into place and he pushes down onto his left toe and releases immediately the right hand. This doing it simultaneously so the climber can bring the right hand over to the next hold at reach. The climber making hand gestures is so that he can mimic the movements on the climb as well as shaping the hands on the form that he will have to hold on to the type of holds he will have to encounter when at the wall. The climber was able to bring the left toe to come into a higher foot placement and immediately after applying pressure onto the foot placement, he releases the right foot from its place and then sends the left hand over to the jug, both of the hands into the same hole. This is called matching. The climber actually does not make the foot placement and instead keeps it extended and presses the toe against the wall. This is so the climber is able to keep the hips close to the wall when performing the transition of his left hand grip over to the smaller hold. The climber was struggling to commit into the move, performing many pull-ups and instead glances down at the feet to perform a foot switch, bringing the left toe to come into placement at the foot hold before removing the right foot. As we can see the climber has brought the right hand over to the next holder reach and he had kept a left leg Extended this is called flagging out so the climbers able to transfer over the way to the right foot being in place and he brings his right side of the body by bringing the right knee in words and Has been able to rotate His right side towards the wall when making the reach due to pushing onto his left Foot against the wall The climber was able to make the right hand placement over to the hole that reached this one being a pinch because the climber is placing the fingers onto one side and then the thumb onto the other and due to having an in cut into each side, it's more of a form of a handle so the climber is able to secure the grip as this is a positive hand placement. The climber was able to gain height by pressing on the right foot being in place as he had kept the left leg extended which this is called flagging so the climber can transfer over the way to the right foot and the climber was able to push the left foot against the wall so that he was able to send his body over to the direction at reach. The climbers right hand grip is placed on the last hold and the climbers able to curl the fingers inside the lip of the hold, this one being a jug and he sends the left hand over to be placed or touch against the hold so the climber is able to demonstrate a match. The climber must demonstrate control and stability while sustaining onto the grip as well as his body positioning in order to complete the climb. The climber is glancing down at the feet. This is because he will be performing a foot switch as well as having to release the heel hook. The type of foot placement that he had done with the left foot initially is called a heel hook as the climber was pressing the outer edge of the heel towards the surface of the hold. And heel hooks can be tricky to release as they provide a lot of power such as bringing the climber center very close to the wall acting almost as a third hand as he was able to pull himself in. Now the climber is bringing the front outer edge of the right foot to come into contact over the hold before releasing the heel hook. The climber has extended the left leg. This is co-flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place and he brings the toe to push against the wall to bring his hips or core close to the wall as the core holds the center of gravity of the climber and as the climber is about to perform the next hold at reach since he's engaging onto a pull up The climbers is starting at a step up start. This is because he is helping the left foot placement to be Over the hold by pushing his right foot towards the mat Once the climber gets to apply pressure at the left foot then he will be able to Raise the right foot off the mat and potentially no longer will be In contact with the mat then the climb will start now. He's starting at a one Start hold where he places both of the hands into the same hold. This is called matching and Places the fingers from above and the thumbs underneath This is so the climber can apply pressure and sustain the grip by squeezing onto the hold Once the climber gets to secure the hand placement, then he will be able to Press down on the feet to make the movement up for the next hold at reach", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He kind of opts on with this right hand, right foot. So he just sticks his left foot behind the back leg and bounce out. That's going to kind of let him get this higher up position, but really sink onto that foot and stay balanced. And just once he kind of fully bounces out, he'll be able to take this left hand off and just move it freely without him swinging off the wall or moving too much. He's getting this kind of nice twist lock technique. So once he gets in that first, the next move, the heel hook is no longer that valuable. So what he does is he steps, he gets opposite of pose with his left hand, right foot, but he kind of side steps it. So that lets his left foot flag out, kind of smear into the wall, keep tension. That's going to kind of twist his hip into the wall, getting his body close to the wall. He's going to be reaching up that right arm. So now that right arm's kind of right up against the wall. He's able to just kind of casually reach up. He's not going to have to pull too much with this left arm. He's going to be able to kind of pivot and stand through his feet. So he's got this kind of big cross move so it was really interesting to see him kind of go through the process of finding different positions that would work. But then finding the one position where he doesn't have to pull too hard and can really explode from his feet and get high up on the wall. So he's starting in a nice relaxed position, but tensioned so his arms, he's not pulling himself off his arms. That's going to really let him lean back and push into those feet and kind of twist around those feet and find the good balancing points from which he can drive from and make moves. He ends up kind of ditching the, so like this, he's kind of exploring all these different positions and sequences to see where he wants to be. So he actually uncommits to the backflag, brings his feet back around, gets his right foot on. So it makes me think that he was thinking he'd move his left hand, but now it looks like he might move his right hand. Again, you can see him really driving, keeping tension with his feet. His opposite pose, again, right foot on. He's got this subtle drop knee and set right knee is facing off to the left. It's letting him twist it and then really post this left foot into the wall and apply that pressure down to stand up the wall. You can see he actually starts with this kind of left heel. What that's going to do is it's going to let him stand up to this foot. So that right foot is going to lift him up. And that heel hook is actually going to pull him to the left. So that way as he moves his left arm up, this left foot is actually helping pull up. And it's taking strain and muscle away from this right hand, so he doesn't have to do it all with his upper body. He's kind of able to do a lot of the move with his lower body.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So this is a pretty basic position The climber was just essentially standing up on his legs kind of reaching over to the next position that he's in right now um however, what I want to point out in this position is the the way that he's kind of hanging himself as he's looking at the next hold of his climb and And that's how he's hanging himself with straight arms here So by maintaining straight arms as often as possible is always an important thing as a climber just because it helps to conserve your energy Especially when you are climbing a longer route um So it's always kind of a good thing to see especially when you're trying to identify What your next move is or you're a little confused of what your next move is But maintaining straight arms this really helps to kind of conserve that energy in your upper arms because they can run out very quickly The only thing I would change is instead of hanging Outwards and away from the wall is I would actually encourage the climber to hang below his hand holds So then that way he's not having to pull or kind of squeeze with his hands a little bit harder Granted his hand holds might be pretty well for him right now but if this were a Difficult opportunity for him. I would definitely encourage the climber to hang underneath his hand holds So then that way he's not forcing himself to squeeze or pinch into them much harder And so here we can see the climber was able to move his left hand up into this next handhold here So in this position we can see that the climber is hanging on with the right hand here As well as utilizing a left foot here and it's kind of hard to see exactly what's going on with his right foot But what we can see is what he is doing with that left foot So we do see that he is turning his left knee over to the right And so because his opposite points of contact which is the right hand and left foot are kind of separated from each other This is what I would call a drop knee instead of a back step for the climber Um, so he is utilizing a drop knee again where that left knee is doing an internal rotation pointing over to the right and what this does is it helps to kind of Control what's going on with his body weight? So the idea with the drop knee here is to transfer some of his body weight over to the right So that he can stabilize himself directly underneath his right arm And by doing that he allows his right shoulder to kind of give pivot point For the rest of his body and so based off of that Pivoting on his right shoulder he's able to stabilize that and bring his left hand up into the position that we see here Um, so this does demand quite a bit of power to be able to coordinate that especially with the shoulder of his right shoulder Um, so this is kind of a harder technique to accomplish but this climber is able to do it pretty well So this is just something to see that takes a little bit more effort to accomplish And so here we can see the climber was able to bring his right hand up into the next hold and then finally bumped it to the final hold that he's now grabbing onto. So in this position we do see the climber is hanging on with the left hand here as well as using a right foot. So once again we do see the opposite points of contact right here and this just really helps to stabilize him between those two points and because they're now lined up we do see that he's kind of sitting with his right knee. It does seem as if it's pointed straight into the wall so what that does is it does actually pull his hip a little bit away from the wall. So because of that he's actually forced to pull himself in with his left arm just ever so slightly but because it does seem like this move is a little bit smaller and easier for him to accomplish it doesn't seem like it's really bothering him too much. But if this were a little bit of a harder move I would definitely encourage the climber to bring his right knee more to the left so then that way he's able to rotate his hip a little bit more and he doesn't have to rely so much on his arm to pull up into this motion. So here we can see the clamber was able to make the first move of bringing his left hand over into this handhold here. So in this move the clamber was able to hang on with his right hand on the starting handhold. And then he is utilizing a left heel hook on the starting footholder here. So because the clamber is using opposite points of contact, which is his right hand and left foot, this does centralize his body between those two points, which puts him naturally in a very balanced position. Now the trick here is to make sure that he is utilizing his legs more than he is utilizing his arms. And that is exactly what we see going on here. So with the heel hook, the heel hook does a really good job of being able to transfer his body weight over to the left. And the way he is able to do that is by engaging his heel hook and pulling his body towards the left side. And when he is doing that he is trying to also make sure that his arms are staying as straight as possible. And this is ensuring that he is not using as much energy on his arms to be able to pull. So this is always a good thing to see when the clamber is utilizing the legs more than the arms. So then that way they are conserving the energy on their upper body as much as possible. And so here we can see that the climber was able to make the next move of bringing his left hand all the way up into this next handhold here. So in this position the climber is still hanging on with the right hand on this hold here, and then he was able to utilize a left foot here. So again, we kind of see the climber is using opposite points of contact, his right hand and left foot, and what's going on here is the climber is really using a lot of tension between his right arm and the twisting of his left foot in order to get the movement he's accomplished here. So the main idea is trying to focus on bringing his left hip rotating closer to the wall. And the main reason why that's necessary is it helps to kind of increase the range that his left hand can get, especially with a move that is as big as it is. And the way that climber is able to do that is to kind of really pivot and rotate around his left foot so that his left knee points a little bit more to the right, and this kind of helps to rotate his hip in the way that it is right here. On top of that, the climber is being forced to pull with his arm. It's most likely in a very flexed position here, but similar to a move that he did earlier, by flexing his right arm, he's able to create enough tension on his right shoulder. So it's also a pivot point so that he can kind of turn and rotate on it. So it's a combination of his legs and his right arm in this case that really helps to accomplish this move. And then on top of that, with the direction of the handhold that his left hand is going to, it is kind of looking like it's at an angled position. So the best way the climber can hang on to it is in a downward right direction, and that's exactly what we see with the climber doing with his body, is he's immediately getting it over and down and to the right. So in that way, he can hang on to the hold in the best way possible. So this is really good to see from the climber overall. And so here we can see the climber is making the next move of bringing his right hand up into this next handhold here So in this position the climber is hanging on with his left hand here and he does have a right foot somewhere behind his body So it's a little bit hard to see in this image here. So again, he's using opposite points of contact. So it's this continuing Trend that the climbers using opposite points of contact that is a really good thing to see Just because this does help to really control the body weight and balance of the climber So this is a good thing to see overall But what we're seeing here is that the climber is being forced to have to really pull and engage With this left hand and one of the main reasons why I think that's the case It's because of the direction of the handhold I do believe the handhold is kind of slanted over facing to the right And what this does is it forces the climber to have to hang on to it in a very awkward position So this kind of forces the climber to have to engage it a little bit more to get the best use out of it So that's what we're seeing here with this climber Pulling in with his left arm But he's also doing a good job of trying to transition some body weight and controlling it With his right foot as he reaches up with the right hand And so here we can see the climber is able to make the next move of bringing his right hand up into this next handhold here. So in this move the climber is hanging on with the left hand here as well as utilizing a right foot in this position here. So again the climber is using opposite points of contact, however this time the points of contact are lined up with each other, so kind of stacked on top of each other. So what this does is it does allow the climber to kind of pivot and rotate mainly around his right foot. So in this position the climber gets himself into a move called a backstep. And a backstep here really allows the climber to utilize the lower legs much more for being able to produce the power to get him up higher on the wall. So the main thing that we want to focus on is in this case the climber is able to rotate the right side of his body closer to the wall. And the main way he's able to do that is by pivoting around the right foot so that the right knee is pointed over to the left. And this helps to kind of guide that hip further in the direction that he wants to go. And this also in turn helps to guide the right hand up in the direction that he wants to do. On top of that, the climber always wants to be able to have a good flagging foot. So in this case the left foot is going to be our flagging foot. And that flagging foot just really helps to push and press off of the wall to kind of help coordinate the movement that he wants to do, as well as creates tension throughout the entire body so then that way he's not getting in an imbalanced position. So this is a really good illustration of what a back step looks like for the climber.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So climber eventually commits to making this large cross move after a lot of inefficiency and hesitation and trying to read how to best do this. Because they're a taller climber, they will do this with the foot still on here, but because these holds are so positive, they could have just jumped across and cut feet and still replaced it. They could have put their foot up right and still pulled through and been able to going through. So they could have done this move several different ways. It just took a lot of energy for them to commit to finding a way they were willing to try. So we see the climber begin the attempt by following the judge's laser pointer as they're going around the wall Generally what we'd want to see here is the climber also pantomiming the sequence as much as possible the more they do this on the ground the more they memorize or come up with a plan For what their anticipated sequences the more likely that would be successful on the wall. They spend less time searching for holds Interesting choice here. This large sloper is a much harder hold to control than the hold that the climber opts for. This really looks like it was intended as a heel hook later on, so good read for them to hit the hold and then just bump off to the better option. So good position as the climber pulls on, engaging the left heel. You can see their leg bent, pulling in with the hamstring to get the hips further left as they pull their body to the left. So this is a bit better. They're laying on the ground, they're reviewing the problem one more time. We see their hands actually kind of in the position that they expect to use. What we see more advanced climbers do is they start sequencing the foot positioning and lower body as well.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

You see how long their body is here, utilizing the core tension there and crossing over into this hold on the head wall. This pinch is quite good and it's allowing them to keep the hips into the wall and keep the body straight and thus driving weight into the foot, even though they get so extended. Additionally, this left hand is down pulling and is pretty forgiving for the climber. And so it's really just the commitment to go there that makes this move difficult rather than the position that they're going into. Climber then switches back to that start foot and drives up tall, initially grabbing this fin hold here, kind of calculating while climbing, realizing this isn't quite that good. So they back out of it and go left hand in a wrap on this pinch here. And here they are actively getting a right foot higher onto that start hold. Here we have the climber matched on this lateral pinch here and a solid left heel hook. You can see by the climber's vision that they are planning to go to hold where the laser pointer is pointing. And after getting a right foot up, the climber touches an intermediate hold on the headwall and quickly goes up right hand into the finish hold and matches for the top. Climbers are able to utilize that start hold as a foot for the right and lock down that wrap slash left hand gaston, shoulder into it with this left shoulder, and go right hand into the jug here. They're then able to build the left foot onto that first hold of the sequence and come in and match this jug here. The climber is able to rock over this left heel and get into this left hand pinch here, then a quick foot switch, and then flagging this left foot out and driving the right knee in towards the plane of the body, shifting the right hip into the wall in order to lock off this left arm. It allows the climber to reach up and right into this pinch here.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And because the climber is swinging out towards the right, his right hand has peeled off from the hand placement. The climber, once securing the placements, he then glances over to the hold at reach. This is because he will have to perform a DYNA, which stands for dynamic move. In hat lower, he's center of gravity to keep the feet at a high stance. And the climber right now is swinging right to left to build momentum for when he's ready, commit to the spring out of his placements to go up for the hold at reach. He will have to do this by once swinging back to the right side to be pressed first onto his left foot. And once a climber gains height, he will have to engage on bringing his chest close to the wall. That way he can remain underneath the hold at reach. The climbers is starting at a two hand hold start. Both of the holds He is sustaining into a type of hold that's called a donut This is because it has a hole on the inside and the climber has placed the fingers as far in as possible into the hold and places the thumbs on the outside. This is for the climber to then give extra strength onto the grip by squeezing onto the hold. As we can see the climber is glancing down at the feet and it is important that he makes an accurate foot placement and is performing a step up start where the climber will then create pressure onto the left toe coming into place to then raise the right foot onto the wall. When the climber is no longer standing on the mat, then the climb will start. If the climber was to attempt this again, he could consider bringing the left hand over to a match. This is so that he has more gripping power to support himself from swinging out. It is important the climber brings the hand open-handed and places it as far in into the lip of the hold. This is so that he's able to secure the hand placement before dropping his weight. This is an immediate drop of the weight to the hand placement. So the climber, it is important that he creates friction and curls the fingers around the lip of the hold in order to secure the grip. This is because the climber has thrown his center of gravity out, which he will be going out for a swing and it is key that the climber secures the right hand grip as he will be sent out on this swing. So he will have to engage on to keeping body tension on engaging the core and picking up the feet in order to control the swing. At this moment the climber is flying and has lost contact of his placements due to performing the jump. He has boosted the jump with the right foot when he was gaining height, however he has pushed slightly his center of gravity away from the wall. So it is key that the climber lands the right hand over the edge of the hole that reached. The climber right now is chucking up his hands. This will help the climber to gain a better grip when sustaining onto the holds as well as absorbing any moisture that may be coming up from his hands. The climber is now committed on the jump and as we can see he had pushed forcefully onto his left foot. This is so the climber was able to swing over to his right side as well as gaining direction to the holder reach. It is important that the climber then brings the right knee inwards to keep his right side towards the wall which helps him to bring his center of gravity close to the wall when performing the reach. As the climber is gaining height he is almost bringing the chest where his hand placements are so it is important that he pulls himself in to keep the chest towards the wall. That way when the climber gets to make his way up he stays underneath the holder reach. At this view we can see how the climber is sustaining onto his right hand grip. This one is more positive and rounded than the left hand grip. As we can see down at the feet, the climber has brought the right foot to bring the toe box area of the foot to surface the large hold. The climber shaking his arms is to warm up and to release any tension from his muscles. This helps the climber to loosen up and warm up the shoulders, back, forearms, and as we can see at the end he shakes the hands so that he can get all that warmed up before starting to climb.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He does hit this hold. That's hard to know how hard the rest of the route is without seeing it. So maybe there's some harder spots up there, but just judging the dino, I mean he does hit it. The dino's arm is really straight and his, so he's hitting it already at the edge of his reach, so he needs to just hit higher so he can kind of have his arm bent and engaged on it. That's going to let him kind of control the swing and also go higher. He does the left hand up. It'll also kind of break up his swing because right now it's like he's, his body's full length. That's a lot big lever to pull out, but if his body is kind of bent like this, that's a much smaller lever to swing out on. So it's gonna be less force on his arms and easier to control.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So in this position we can see that the clamber is allowing himself to be in a straight arm position. And then on top of that what the clamber is doing is he's allowing himself to swing from left and all the way from the right. So he's kind of been doing this back and forth. And this is a really good thing to see because it does help the clamber to build an understanding of the movement that's required of him to complete this dino. Because ultimately he's wanting to focus on what's going on with his legs. Because that is a stronger muscle base that can produce a lot of power and strength in order to get him up to this dynamic move. So it's really nice to see that this clamber is swinging from side to side. So that way he can understand the transferring that's going on with his legs. And this really sets him up really well. And so here we can see the climber is reaching out with his right hand to grab onto the screen hold here And this is also the instant where both feet and hands are off away from the wall So this is a complete dyno at this point And the one thing I am noticing though as the climber is jumping off in this position We do kind of see that his hip is sitting out and away from the wall So what this means is it helps to pull the rest of his body away from the wall as well Which can actually make it a little bit harder for him to actually hang on to the screen hold Even though it does seem like he's jumping high enough and hard enough to be able to reach it and grab onto it Because his hip is already sitting away from the wall It's gonna be making it a little bit harder for him to actually hang on to this position if he does grab onto it", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The climber is shorter so they get a lot of distance on this to be able to get their hand all the way over this top point of the hold. They need to bring the left hand up almost immediately to match to control a swing because the way their body is arcing out now, they're going to just swing backwards and their feet are either going to hit the ground or they're going to kind of scorpion and fall forward. So we see climber taking a deep setting breath and doing some aggressive shaking and arm swings before starting this problem. It's a large dynamic move, so something we'll see a lot of climbers do is they kind of start hyping themselves up in terms of breathing and body language before trying a move that requires a lot of aggression. And we see it's almost both right there. Feet hit the ground and their face starts coming down towards the ground. So luckily they caught themselves there. Otherwise middle face smack of a fall. So we see the climber beginning to pendulum with their hips trying to throw them in the right direction so that when they come back in this direction, they release and come up towards the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

You see the right hand here, but you also get to see this left push foot, the right platform foot. See how they have a ton of rubber on this foot. The objective is to get over the right foot and spring up the wall. Oftentimes with these dinos, you see the climber going straight for the hold, and sometimes that's deceiving. They want to orient their jump to the hold, whereas sometimes it's better to orient above the hold or to the left of the hold, depending on where you're going or starting from. This allows the climber to remember that the best way to get over is to go up. That's just one thing that is common with coaching dinos. And climber then springs up right hand into the dino And target hold here on the dino. I did notice that the climber was looking down at their feet before they sprung up I Think that this is unnecessary. It's good to always be looking at the target There might be some indecision about the feet But oftentimes with one of these dinos the feet will take care of themselves and it's good to focus on where the hands are going sometimes Also, I do think that going two hands to this hold is the ideal method", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This is called the toe hook so the climber uses it to increase more points of contact towards the wall in order to release some of the pressure of the right hand grip as the climber needs to readjust the grips before committing to the next move. The bicycle cannot only be done with one foot it actually needs to be done with the pressure coming from above as well from the other foot so as the climber is pressing down onto the right toe towards the hold the climber is pulling the left toe and the same hold towards him. The climber had made the reach pulling the body forward. However Immediately when the climber got to place the hand over the hold He dropped the weight and this was too soon When making the hand placement if the climber was to attempt this again, it is important that the climber tries to lock the move meaning to keep the Right arm to be bended and stand up forcefully over the left toe While potentially pushing onto the right toe against the wall So that he can continue to stay as close as he can to the wall in order to adjust the left hand grip this is Hold in which is a block with flat surface onto the top pointing down slightly and Also flat at the edges Where the climber could potentially use the corners of the hold in order to fold the grip This is an open-handed Way of attempting to make the hand placement So the climber in trying to close the grip around the corner of the hold would be ideal to increase Surfacing the skin towards the hold and close it at the same time But the climber in this case dropped the weight too early on to his hand placement The climber is sending the right foot over to the right side with the leg extended. This is called flagging out. So the climber was able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place to continue pushing against the hold. This brings the climber's center of gravity to the right side and to remain underneath his grips. As we can see, as he was doing that transition, he quickly sent the left hand from the undercling to come over to a match at the jug. The flag usually works for the climber to gain stability and balance over the move. The climber had glanced up to see the next move on the route and glances down at the feet. This is important because the climber must make sure to make an accurate foot switch or new foot placement. Due to having both of the feet onto the same hole, the climber is going by feel due to not having the best view. The climber brings the right toe to come into place, touching at the hold while the left foot is turning the ankle out to give space for the right foot coming in. Once the climber gets to apply pressure and secure the foot placement, then he will be able to release the left foot from its place. The climber had slipped off from the purple hold when going up for the reach and this was immediate weight transfer to the left hand grip. So if the climber before starting the climb could benefit from brushing the hold as well as chucking up the hands to gain a better grip. Here we can see how the climber had performed a foot switch blindly and is applying the most pressure onto that left foot placement by dropping the heel and pressing onto the left toe. As the climber once releasing the right foot we can see the right leg being extended and presses the toe against the wall. This is so the climber can bring the center of gravity close to the wall which is in the core while pulling onto the right hand grip to bring himself forward. This is a dynamic move so the climber after doing the foot switch needed to perform this quickly to move over to the hold that reach. The climber is glancing over to the next hole that reach and has brought the left foot to come into surface Where the right foot is this is because the climber is blindly Performing a foot switch and only goes by feel The climbers are starting at a two hand hold start and both of the holds are held differently. The right hand, the climbers are standing to a large jug where he gets to place the hand above the lip of the hold. And for the left hand, the climber wraps the hand from underneath the hold. This is because the jug is placed upside down. Sliding the fingers behind the edge of the hold and cupping it. This type of left hand grip is called an undercling. The climber glances down at the feet and this is important as the climber is making a foot switch technique in which he brings the outer edge of the right foot to surface at the very inside and towards the hold. Once the climber gets to apply pressure of the right foot coming into place and the climber quickly releases the left foot and as soon as the climber gets that space then he will roll the right toe over to hold. This is the most accurate way of making a foot switch, also the most energy efficient as the climber would always have contact with the foothold during the process. The climber has brought the left foot at a high foot placement coming onto a match. A match means is when both of the limbs are into the same hold and he intentionally has brought the foot to be across in inwards from the left hand. This is because eventually he will have to release the left hand from its place and so places the foot towards the inside and above the hold. Once the climber got to apply pressure of the foot coming in which will be pushed down in a way opposite direction of the pole, then he will be able to secure the foot placement and quickly has released the right foot from its place. This is because the climber will have to bring eventually his center of gravity underneath the grips The climbers are starting at a step up start meaning that once he gets to place his left foot onto the wall which is placed on a small foot chip and raises the right foot off the ground and the climb will start immediately applying weight to his placements and in order to apply pressure for the grips to sustain them he Will have to pull the grips towards him", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

But this foot is kind of, it's not really driving her up. It's kind of keeping tension by towing in. So she isn't able to really push by towing in. I think this is where the heel hook would come into more play, it would let her at least get closer to the wall. Because right now she's having the same problem where this is kind of pushing her out from the wall. And she's having to fight that by pulling in. So it's making this move really, really hard. And it's really hard on her arms. She's having to really pull in and coordinate and use her core and her upper body to pull herself in. And also this hold is really flat and negative. So there's not really a positive edge to it. Whereas if she had the heel hook, she'd be way underneath the wall. So when she grabs it, she's going to be kind of pulling straight through it and maximizing her friction. By towing in and having her hip so far from the wall, now when she hits it, she also has to pull in on that too. So everything's just kind of pulling out away from the wall. She's going to have to counter and pull extra hard in because she's got this toe on instead of this heel hook. And the position of her hips are just not ideal. So let's get off to this good start. He's got these two opposing handholds. Actually, he's got these two opposing handholds that kind of allow for this compression. This left side is at an undercut or undercling, so that means the positive side is just kind of pulling up to it, which also is going to affect kind of how good of a foot this is. And she is able to get this kind of hand foot match here. So I should free up her left hand. The top isn't as positive. So she's going to keep a little extra tension. Maybe in this case, it would be better to heel hook because the positive edge is on that side, it kind of facing down. So this could be a really good opportunity to do a heel hook and you could drop that right foot and really suck that hip into the wall. Cause right now she's kind of a little bit farther away from the wall. So all that's gonna be kind of pulling out on her. And she's gonna have to kind of fight this, pulling back by pulling harder into the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I mean the one way to see that is by allowing their knee to be more parallel towards the wall So it would be pointed out to the left And by doing this it does allow them to kind of travel more over the left foot and place a little bit more of the Body weight onto the left foot, but in the way that the climber did the move I mean they are kind of relying more on the right arm to pull them up into this motion But because it's with their right arm It does kind of in a way pull them away from going over in the direction that they really need to go So here we can see the Clamor is getting himself ready to bring his left hand up into this next handhold so he can be matched on this hold. So what we see the Clamor doing is what we call a hand-foot match. So in this case we can kind of see in the first person point of view that he is originally hanging on with his left hand here. And then he is able to place a high left foot on the same handhold there. So it's what we typically call a hand-foot match. So one of the ways that you are able to do this, because it does require some flexibility, but if you are not really too flexible there is still a way to accomplish a move like this. And one of the ways is to make sure that you stay with your arms in a very straight position. So we can see exactly that the Clamor is doing that. And so by allowing themselves to have these straight arms it does allow the rest of the body to kind of extend downwards. And making sure that we stay, have a good tension and a lot of our body weight is under control. And so what the Clamor is able to do is tuck their hip back and out and away from the wall. So this creates a little bit more room and a little bit more space for their left foot to kind of make the way up into this foothold. So this is a good demonstration to see from the Clamor for a hand-foot match. And so here we can see that as the climber was able to bring their left hand up into this next handhold We can see that a lot of their body weight did shift over to the right But I think that's an acceptable thing just because the angle of the hold is slightly slanted So the best way to hang on to it is going to be downwards away from it and that would be down to the right So that's a good thing to see from the climber And then on top of that we do see that there are maintaining good body position on the left foot But make sure it's in a bent position", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This is so that he's able to apply more support to his right side being the main areas of support when transferring over the left hand to come over to a match. The leg being extended and folded behind the right foot being in place. This is called back flagging so that he can bring his center of gravity close to his areas of support. The climber dropping the right foot is to bring his center of gravity underneath his right hand grip and quickly transfers over the left hand over to the last hold. The climber must demonstrate control and stability while sustaining the match as well as his body position. If he's able to demonstrate this, then the climb is completed. The climber in gaining momentum for the reach, his only main areas of support are his left hand and his right foot being in place. So keeping the left leg extended helps the climber to balance over his main areas of support when going out for the reach. The climber in making the move of the left hand to come over to a match where the right hand is He had pressed down onto his left foot this is so that he was able to throw his Center of gravity in the opposite direction and gain height when releasing the right foot from its place Now the right toe will be coming into place at a large foothold both of them coming into a match As we can see the climber had kept left leg extended. This is called flagging out So he was able to transfer over the way to the right foot being in place when performing the move and as we can see the leg that's out in a flag has Folded behind the right foot. This is now called back flagging and he does this so that he can twist His side of the body towards the wall when performing the reach It also helps to bring his center of gravity to his main areas of support and Bringing the foot over to the right side helps support the move as well The climber was able to send the left hand over to the next hold at reach, this one being a jug since he's able to wrap the hand around the lip of the hold. And jugs usually don't require a lot of energy from the climber. So in this case, the climber, in order to make the reach, he has brought the left knee inwards so he can keep his left side of the body towards the wall. And had pushed down on the right foot in order for him to gain direction to the hold at reach. Quickly, the foot busting the move had come out of placement and then immediately becomes, with the leg extended, not having contact with the hold. This is called flagging out, so that he's able to transfer over the way to the left foot being in place. This is so that he's able to balance over his areas of support while performing the reach. The climber had performed a foot switch and drops the left foot out of place. This is uh he can use it as a tail to balance over his main areas of support. As we can see the climber pulls onto the grip to bring it towards the chest. This is called the lock off and the climber immediately presses onto the right toe placement in order to gain direction to the hold at reach. Also bringing the right hand to the right side of the hold the climber is able to place the fingers behind the lip of the hold making it positive as this one is a jug. The climbers right hand with the fingers placed over the right side of the hold even though it's a jug which is a lip Making it a positive grip regardless the climber will have to pull it on the opposite direction Reason why he is creating a lay back over to the left side and brought the left foot at a high foot placement this Both of the feet at this point Pushing away from the hold helps the climber to keep the center of gravity to be pushed at the other direction and it is important that he brought the Foot positioning this way to keep his left side of the body towards the wall The climber was able to make the next hold at reach. He does this because he brought the left foot to come into a tap against the wall. This one is smearing the rubber of the shoe towards the wall. This will create enough pressure as he would create pressure on the same way towards a small foothold, except that there is no foothold there. This is so that climber was able to stabilize the movement by to keep his hips towards the wall when performing the reach. The climbers is starting on a two hand hold start and the type of holds that he's sustaining are called jugs, since they have an indent behind the edge of the hold where he gets to place the fingers to wrap around the edge, this one being a positive grip. After the climber securing the right hand placement, we can see him lowering his center of gravity. This is so that he's able to extend the arms to transfer over his weight to the grips. And right now he's glancing down at the feet. This is because he's performing a foot switch and needs to make sure he does this accurately by bringing the left toe over the edge of the hold and apply pressure to release the right foot from its place. The climber adjusts the left hand to be placed over the right side of the hold, coming to a match at the edge, so the climber can release the right hand from its place to perform the next move at reach. The climber is sustaining into two positive grips so he leans back to transfer over the weight to the grips having the arms extended. This is called the wrist position because he's not engaging on the arm muscles which is a moment for recovery as he glances up the wall. Since the next move is a hold at reach he is getting his feet positioned higher. In this case he just brought into position the right foot over a large hold. The climber continues to glance over to the next hold at reach and in doing so, before sending the right hand over to a match at the jug, he has performed the foot switch blindly, this one by sending the right toe to come into place at the large foot hold to release then the left foot from its place. The climber potentially started at a sit start and sit starts add a grade of difficulty to the climb because he will have to pull his weight onto the wall before starting the climb. In this case he was able to quickly send the right hand over to the holder reach this one being a jug since he's able to wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold and secures the grip and leans back. As we can see he's bringing now his right foot into a high foot placement and it is important that he always glances down at the feet when performing a new foot placement. This is secured as the lip of the hold is wide so he can place the front area of his toe box towards the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So here you can see he doesn't have his left foot on anything. So sometimes it is better to just have one foot on. So he's grabbing with the left hand, toeing with the right foot. He's reaching up with the right hand and you'll notice that it kind of mimics almost. So his left foot is off and kind of flaking off to the side, kind of straight and rigid, just like his reaching arm. And this kind of allows him to suck his hips into the wall. Whereas he was trying to pivot around two legs. He might not have like the perfect balance point, but by dropping the foot and just flaking it out, it lets him kind of just suck those hips straight into the wall and get a really nice balanced position. So off to a good start, he also has a left hand, he's kind of utilizing his thumb as well. So anytime you can get your thumb on something, whether it be resting against your fingers, pinching against the hold, getting the thumb involved kind of brings the palm up and almost kind of creates a more aggressive grip, or can help with just full on wrapping the thumb over the fingers. So utilizing the thumb in other ways just beyond wrapping the thumb can do a lot of good. Here we see he does a good job keeping the feet on so he's able to kind of explode and pull. He also extends up through his feet to keep the tension. He's able to keep both feet on, his one foot kind of posts up, the other foot kind of pivots and twists. So this left one, this left leg is kind of turning in, this knee is kind of turning in, almost dropping, it's kind of stuck his hips close to the wall. And then once he's in that position, he's able to use the other foot to kind of drive himself up into the left.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So in this position he is hanging on with the left hand here, and he is using a low right foot in this position right here, and then again he is flagging his left foot down into the left right here. So even though he's kind of angled, he's still holding a similar position to his previous moves and where his hand is going to be centered in between his two feet contact, so even though his left foot is in a flagging position because he's keeping it so pressed up against the wall it's creating a lot of good tension throughout his entire body, so it kind of acts as another point of contact and it helps to also center his gravity so that he's in much more control. So what the Clamor is doing here is he's making sure to just really stand up nice and tall on his right foot, and then on top of that we can kind of see a little bit of hip rotation where the right side of his hip is going to be turning over to the right, and this helps to kind of encourage the movement he's going for with that right hand. So this is a really good position to see from the Clamor, that's really nice and controlled. The only thing that's kind of making it a little bit difficult to move from this position is how extended the Clamor is in relation to his right arm and right leg. Because they're almost in full extension, this does make it a little bit harder for the Clamor to kind of continue movement, so I would always warn Clamors to avoid getting in too much of an extended position because it could make the previous or the next move much harder. So I would definitely encourage this Clamor to kind of consider thinking about getting a higher foot if being in this position is a little bit hard to move away from. And so here we can see the Clammer was able to bring in his right hand into this next handhold So he is matched on it now, but in his starting position He was hanging on with this left hand here Then he was able to utilize a right foot in this position here And then he's also utilizing a left flagging foot kind of going down into the left Now similar to what I talked about in the previous move This is another instance where the Clammer is naturally in a very balanced position Even though he's not placing two feet on two separate footholds He's still technically utilizing three points of contact right here Because if we draw another line straight down from his hand We can kind of see that with his right foot It's to the right of that line and his left flagging foot It still acts as another point of contact because it is flagging into the wall So with that that does allow his body to be pretty even between those points of contact and what this does is Allows him to be in a very comfortable position to move into the next position So this is always a good thing to see from Clammers And this is what we call a good resting position Because it also includes very straight arms That helps to conserve the energy in his upper body While he's placing a lot of his body weight on his legs as he does this And so here we can see the climber was able to bring his left hand And so he's now matched on the same hand hold as his right hand So with that move he was hanging on with the right hand here As well as the right foot and then originally his left flagging foot was out and to the left And we can see that he did decide to start to flag it out and to the right I mean again, that's mainly because he's using two points of contact that were on the right side of his body So in order to kind of compensate for the natural rotation that's taken on his on his body Which is going to be rotating over to the right the climber flagged his left foot over and to the right and this helps to kind of Mitigate the swing in that his body's going to naturally take so helps to reduce any pulling or unnecessary swinging So this is a really good thing to see from the climber And so here we can see the climber was able to reach over with his right hand over into this next handhold however what we can see is that the climber is kind of allowing themselves to just kind of pull and pivot around his left shoulder right here to kind of create that movement So this could just be because the climber is pretty comfortable with this movement and the difficulty of the climb Being that it does look like they're on pretty good handholds And so that could be the main reason why the climber just kind of did it in this fashion But then on top of that because he is hanging on with the left hand He made sure that he centered his handhold in between both of his feet So he was able to keep his right foot on this foothold here And then he did start flagging his left foot out and to the left So that doesn't actually place his left hand in between both of his foot points. So again, this puts him in a very balanced position So here we can see the climber was able to make the first move of bringing his right hand up into this next handhold here. So in this move it was hard to see exactly where his feet were planted and which hold he was using. So the only thing I can take note of is the climber's decision in going for this handhold did result in him allowing both of his feet to come off the wall right here. And typically I would not really recommend this for climbers unless it's a complete dynamic move. The reason why I say that is because as a climber allows their feet to come off the wall this does force 100% of their body weight to be placed on their upper body. So it does make it where they're using up a lot of energy very quickly by hanging on their hands in this manner. So I would always kind of recommend to climbers to at least allow one foot to be continually placed on the wall so then that way they can conserve the energy on the arms. Because as you use a lot of energy in your arms it does make it very difficult or hard to complete a boulder. So I would always recommend a climber to at least keep one foot on the wall at all times. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring his left hand up into this next handhold So he's now matched on it so as we can see The climber was hanging on with the right hand for this move here And then he was able to get a higher foot in a pretty controlled position So he was able to get a left foot up into this next foot hold right here And then he was able to place his right foot on the same time as well Um, so the reason why the climber is hanging back into the left Which is actually a good thing Is because of the angle of the hold The angle of the hold was kind of in this fashion where it's kind of facing up and rightwards So usually the best way to kind of hang on to and hold this in an angle position Is going to be perpendicular from it in a bottom direction So that's exactly the direction that the climber is hanging is going to be bottom into the left of it So this is a really good thing to see from the climber Where he is kind of demonstrating a good understanding of how to position himself to where he's not having to pull Unnecessarily with his arms And then again he's also showing he's able to place a lot of body weight on his feet by being in a bent position here And so here we can see the climber was able to reach up with his left hand up into this next handhold here So in this position the climber is hanging on with a right hand here And then he was able to keep a right foot in this position here So now we see that the climber is using two points of contact that are on the same side of his body And what this does is does actually place him in a kind of an imbalanced position Because ultimately what's happening is a lot of his body wants to kind of rotate around those two points So the left side of his body wants to go over to the right side of those two points of contact So with that rotation, it's kind of pulling him in a direction that's opposite in the way he wants to go So in order to kind of compensate for that the climber does have to do a couple things One of the first things is going to be this left flagging foot And the reason why his left flagging foot is going over to the right Is it kind of helps to distribute a little bit of his body weight over? Onto the right side of those two points of contact and this helps to alleviate The rotation that his body is experiencing And then on top of that the climber is being forced to have to pull in With his right arm in order to complete this move and that's what ultimately keeps his body straight and forward Going in the direction that he wants to go so that he's not rotating rightwards So this kind of movement does require a little bit more power and a little bit more strength So I would not really recommend it for climbers Especially if they're beginners because it does require a little bit more energy and coordination and understanding of balance And so here we can see the climbers was able to make the next move of bringing his left hand up into this next Hand holder here. So in this position he was able to place a left or sorry a right hand on this hand hold here And then you did also place a left foot tucked away behind his body here Then he was also able to utilize a right foot in this position here Um, so with his three points of contact in this position right here This is what I always like to say a nice balanced position Just because if we look at his right hand it is basically centered in between both points of his feet So his right foot is up to the right of it And his left foot is up to the left of it And what this does is it helps to create a really balanced point between his hand hold position So then that way he can kind of distribute his body weight in the correct way that he wants So what he's ultimately trying to do with this movement here is that with his right foot He's pushing off that right foot so that he can direct his body weight over to the left and then ultimately when he's ready He's gonna stand up on that left foot or kind of push up with it So then that way he can kind of direct his body in the direction that he wants to go to So this is a really good thing to see from the climber where it shows that he's in a nice balanced position And he has really good control of what's going on with his movement", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They turn in with the right hip as they reach up with the right hand towards this really large hold.

They started right hand down on this side pull, left hand on a down pulling jug, and there's a right foot on the wall as well. And they just stand up into this jug here, and will then progress up the wall. Climber then comes up into this orange jug, thinks it's the top, but the crowd helps him out and he's able to continue to traverse across the headwall into what is the finish hold for the top. Climbers then able to surf up through these jugs. And here they are about to initiate the move up to where the laser pointer is here. Driving through this left foot, cranking down on both arms and getting over this foot with the hips is going to allow the climber to go up and left. This boulder is what we call a jug haul.

That way the climber can make an easy transition of the left hand over to the next hold at reach. At this moment the climber is glancing over to the hole that reach and has stepped on his left toe with the knee inwards to keep the left side of the body close to the wall. That will help the climber to once extending on the leg to gain height to keep also the left side of the body towards the wall. At this moment the climber yet has applied pressure or placement of the right foot and instead only bringing the center of gravity close to the wall while pulling on the grips. The climber is starting at a two-hand hold start. For the right hand, the climber is placing the grip farther up on the hold. This is so the climber can stay close to the next hold at reach. And we can see it being pressed with the thumb into one side and the fingers on the other. This type of grip is called the pinch and the climber will apply pressure by squeezing onto the hold and pulling it back. For the left hand, the climber is applying the finger pads over a small edge of the hold and places the thumb onto the side. This is called an open cramp because the climber will eventually fold the knuckles up in order to drive force onto the fingertips being in place. And if the climber was to gain height, he must keep the elbow close to the wall to drive force by pulling it down. The climber was able to bring his weight close to the wall but quickly drops the weight and The left hand has come out of place This is due to the climber having to keep the body close to the wall to keep the elbow Underneath the grip to pull it downwards in this case. It will be really hard for the climber to recover the move The climber is tall and so he's starting the climb on a sit start. And sit starts are usually known to add a grade to the climb due to the climber having to pull his weight over the placements. So the climber wants to get to place the feet onto the wall and is no longer sitting on the mat, then the climb will start. In this case, the climber has placed the left toe over a small foothold. This one we will call the chip. And is bringing the left knee to come inwards. So when the climber gets to press onto his left toe against the hold to lift the hips, then he will bring the right foot over to the wall. It's also on purpose that the climber brings the knee inwards and this is to bring the center of gravity over to the left side when bringing the right foot at a high foot placement.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

But as soon as the Clamor starts getting up into the starting position, we can see a couple things. One of the first things is that the Clamor is kind of automatically pulling himself up into the handholds that he's utilizing. So we can kind of see both arms are in a very flexed position right here. So by doing this, this does kind of naturally place him into a similar to an upwards pull-up position. And naturally, this is a very difficult position to hang on to. So because the Clamor is doing this naturally as he gets up into the starting position, it kind of shows that the Clamor is having a little bit of difficulty of hanging onto these handholds. And so the common misconception is that Clamor just needs to pull themselves up into these handholds to try and make them feel better and to use them better. But in reality, that kind of makes it a little bit harder to do. And one of the things that's probably making it harder for this Clamor to be able to complete the movement is it does seem like he has a right foot as well as a left foot on the wall. So because of that, it does make it a little bit hard for him to really transition his bodyweight properly onto one foot or the other. So what I would recommend for the Clamor is allowing one of his feet to be in a flagging position while the other foot continues to be on the foothold. So that way he can properly transition his bodyweight onto that foot that's on a foothold. And that way he can help alleviate the amount of pressure that he's experiencing on his upper body.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This one because it would be a very limited range of motion in order to sustain the grip. There are many ways for the climber to attempt his body positioning and gripping power when performing this move. It would be really important that the climber spend some time from the ground visualizing the wall before committing to the climb. The climber was losing the right hand grip and needed to release some pressure to reapply the hand placement. He does this by sending the right leg that was extended on the flag this time to be with the foot over to the left side. This is called back flagging and presses the right toe against the wall. This is so he has another point of contact creating pressure to support his left side being his main areas of support to release some of the pressure at his right hand grip during the process of reapplying pressure. In the process, the climber once landed with the right hand to secure the right hand placement. He has lost pressure of his left foot being in place. For more information, visit www.FEMA.gov The climber in reaching the right hand over to the next holder reach he's now completely extended and glances down at the feet to perform a foot switching technique that is more accurate to do as the climber sends the left outer edge of the toe to meet the hold. This making contact with the hold the climber then is pulling out the right foot from its place. Once the climber gets a space of the right foot coming out then he was able to roll in the left toe to surface the hold. He is not losing contact with the hold when making the foot switch so this one is more energy efficient and the most consistent with applying weight transference when doing the switch. The climber glances down at the feet and this is because he's performing a foot switch technique which is called the jump off jump on technique. He press hard into the left foot to then jump the left toe out of place and immediately sends the right toe to come into place against the hold. This foot switch technique works when done in a large hold but is not the most accurate as it takes a fair bit of energy and if the climber lands the foot onto the wrong area of the hold then he might lose the placement. The climber has lost a left foot placement as we can see it it's already being brought down. It would be really hard for the climber to recover the move at this moment because he's already maximizing the amount of force on the grips and would be overloading his weight onto them. The climber had matched the feet and it was to perform a foot switch where he drops the right foot to keep the right leg extended. This is called flagging so he's able to transfer over the way to the left foot being in place. And as the climber had gained height after performing the foot switch, he can no longer keep the right arm extended. This is a sloper hold so the climber is engaging now onto a forceful pull up. This is taking a lot of energy since it's a wide pull up. And the climber is applying extra pressure at the fingertips, the reason why he's no longer applying the thumb underneath the hold for his left hand. Instead of a pinch, now he has been transferred so for him to curl the fingertips into the hold. This one is to give more pressure at the grip. Similar to the application when sustaining to a crimp. And this is maximizing the force at the grip in order to sustain it. The climber must move out of this move quickly since it only can be held for so long. While the climber transitioned his feet over to be positioned at a high foot placement, he has brought both of them into a match. For his left hand, he was no longer sustaining it onto a pinch. Instead, he was pressing the one side of the hold. This is so that he was able to gain stability when performing the move. As we can see, most of the weight right now is sustained by his right hand placement. The climbers is starting at a one-hole start and applies both of the hands onto the same hold. This is called matching and the climber will be able to start to climb once he is no longer standing on the mat. As we can see he's made the left foot placement on the large hold and places the entire foot to surface with the area of the hold. This one he is pushing away from it so that he can keep his center of gravity beneath his grips. The type of hand placement he is applying is called a pinch due to the fingers being placed from above and the thumbs from underneath. In order to create pressure the climber must squeeze onto the hold and pull back The climber continues to glance down at the feet and is sending the right foot to be placed at a high foot placement. As we can see the climber yet to apply the foot into position. He then jumps the left toe out of place. This is for him to boost the move for his right foot coming into place, potentially because the climber isn't so flexible at the hips. So he does this dynamically to raise the hips in order to make the right foot come into place at a large hold. The climber moves up quickly, this one because he was on pinches which are not the greatest holds to sustain, especially bending the arms. So he sends quickly the right hand over to the next hold at reach. This one helps him keep the arm extended and keeping the arm extended is called the rest position because the climber is not engaging onto the arm muscles, having to use less energy. However, he sends the right hand up to a hold that is rounded. This is called a sloped hold and because of the size of his hand, the climber is able to match the shape of the hold and sending the fingertips as far in as possible. This is so the climber can apply friction of the hand meeting the hold. Once the climber makes a hand placement and presses at the fingertips, he is able to then lean back to apply sufficient pressure. It is important that while sustaining onto that hand grip that he keeps the elbow close to the wall to stay beneath the hold. In order for him to make the reach, we can see how he performed a foot switch and kept the left leg extended. This is called flagging out so he is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. The right knee has come inwards. This is so he is able to keep his right side towards the wall when performing the reach. The climber pressing onto the left foot, he was able to lift up the right foot off the mat and keeps the right leg extended. This is called flagging out. So the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. Flagging out helps the climber to gain balance and stability when performing the move as he is keeping his hips square when performing the next move at reach. The climber had engaged into a very close pull up immediately coming off the mat to transfer over the hand to the next hold at reach. This one being a pinch grip. Since the climber is placing the thumb into one side and the fingers in the other and since it's placed vertically, the climber must continue to apply a squeeze and pull back to apply pressure at the grip.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

He does kind of switch, like extend out of this position, but he seems pretty uncomfortable and he's kind of pulling himself back into this position. It's not exactly a climbing tip, but a chalking up tip. He's kind of brushing his hands together. That's going to ensure a nice, solid, smooth, consistent layer of chalk. But also, he doesn't want too much built up in an area because if he's got too much chalkness in an area, it can actually cause him to slip off. And it would just make it more slippery because it would just be chalk on chalk. Now this position, he kind of needs to let himself sag out to the side and get more under this hold. But he seems to be pulling himself higher and higher into this position. So I think this is where he needs to relax his right foot. So he is right hand, left foot. So now if he sags back out to the right, he should be in a comfortable position between these two spots to kind of almost create this kind of compression between the two holds. And then that right foot can kind of flag out this way and bounce out. And he should be able to come up and match it. Or else he might need to swap feet and get a heel hook here. That might work with how much he's trying to pull himself in on this. But he just kind of looks uncomfortable. I think the reason is he kind of has the precedent of pulling in too much. And both these hand holds aren't that good. So the more out of position you are, the harder you're going to have to pull because they're not as positive and they're more slopey. It's kind of from the get-go it looks like he's really pulling in instead of kind of leaning back and sinking into the position and driving over the feet. Which I think what it's going to do is it's going to set the precedent of kind of leading with the upper body. And I think you'll see him just kind of each progressive move just kind of get pulled in more and more. And it's going to kind of pull him out of position.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And so because of the direction of the left hand hold that he's aiming for, it's kind of in an angled position and it's also a pinch hold, so naturally this kind of makes it a very difficult hold to maintain and hang on to. So what the climber is forced to do is that as soon as he's able to place his left foot on this foothold and kind of transition over into that left hand hold, the climber is immediately forced to have to push off of that left leg to where it places a lot of his body weight back into the right. And one of the main reasons why that's the case is this is what we call a layback position, where the best way to hang on to that left hand hold is to lay back against it, so it literally says in the name. And in this case, the best way to hang on to it is going to be perpendicular away from it. So in this case, it's going to be down and to the right. So we can see that with his foot and with his arm, he is pushing himself back to be centered in that where he's laying back in between both points pretty comfortably. So this is a really good thing to see and when you're doing a layback position, you always want to make sure that your arm is in a very straight position while you're creating a lot of tension with your leg by pushing away from it and getting yourself an optimal position. And so here we can see the climber is now able to make the next move of bringing his right hand up into this next Hand hold here. So in this position he is still hanging on with his left hand here and then he was able to switch his feet So now his right foot is on the starting foot hold So the trick with this position is that he needs to make sure that he continues to press back With that right foot in order to keep that tension that we mentioned earlier to maintain this layback position But now he's transitioned himself into a back step move Back step move is when you're utilizing opposite points of context in this case It's gonna be his left hand as well as his right foot and usually the kind of linear or on top of each other and Then the main point of doing this is to kind of reinforce that his legs are being The main driving force into pushing him up into the next movement And then on top of that he is trying to focus on rotating his right hip closer to the wall So that the right hand reach is a little bit easier to get to But because the angle and direction of the hand hold for his left hand He is being forced to have to pull in with that left arm To kind of continue that rotation of getting to the right side of his body closer to the wall And then on top of that it's also needed to actually engage this hand hold just because it is a pretty difficult hold So he's being forced to kind of pull into it", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Both arms are really tightly locked off almost in like this L shape on each side, 90 degree angle. This is a sign of fatigue. So they're having a really hard time holding this position, may fall off here. So we see the climber begin the attempt by sequencing and pantomiming their anticipated sequence on the problem. The more a climber does this, the more likely they are to identify the holds as they climb and use them correctly, and that makes them more efficient so they are able to complete more of the climb. We'll fall off here Good quick shifts with these body positions as the climber sets up. They very quickly swap from right left to right foot So they can turn the right hip in to be able to reach up with the right hand towards this hold There's multiple juggy spots they can use on this. They're on one of the positive bumps They can also work on engaging their thumb more depending on where they're grabbing to pinch the hold and that provides a more stable position as well", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here you have the climber, one move in, they started matched on this brick pinch here on a good left foot. This left foot is diagonal, so you have to push really hard into it so that the foot doesn't skate out. Nevertheless, they shoulder up into this start hold and are able to grab this descending pinch with the left hand. The climber then switches feet on this start foot into a back step, and putting all the weight into this left pinch, they're able to pounce up into this right hand tufa hold, which they then switch their feet back to the original position with the left foot on the start foot. And here they are targeting the start hold for the next foot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The holds tend to look like they're pretty good and so she's able to generate a lot of force off of them but she could kind of make it a little bit easier by using her feet a little bit more and driving through her legs. I think here she can kind of overemphasize. She's not fully getting into the best position. So I think in this case, she could twist more into the wall, kind of bring her chest to her forearm and bicep, kind of twist more with her hip, and then get this posting foot kind of further out to keep tension and drive her up into the right. It seems like she's maybe like half in position, half out. So she could be in a worse position, but I think she could be in a slightly better position that would help her move up the wall a little bit more smoothly. Ultimately she's just not really able to overcome this being out of position to make the move and she falls off. Now we can see if she kind of tries to get higher, she's just kind of pushing herself straight out from the wall. So she's going to have to, to make this move, she's not only going to have to be pulling herself in, but she's also going to have to move herself up the wall. So she's kind of pulling straight out through this hold, instead of kind of pivoting around it to move up and around it and keeping her arms straight and body close to the wall. So you're gonna see she's starting at a pretty good position. Her arms are nice and straight. So she's not fighting the position to start. She's kind of got on this big nostril like hold. She's got two double under clings. She's kind of, you can see, so she's not fighting the position. She's really driving down through her toe. So overall a pretty good start to the route. So I can see she is matched on this hole and she's attempting to kind of move up and to the right. She's got both her feet on and they're relatively close to each other. We can see that's kind of bending her legs. It's kind of keeping her hips further from the wall. So in this case, and she's brought the left hand up as kind of an undercling, we know she's going to kind of move up with the right hand. Here's where she could kind of plant the right foot, twist her whole right hip into the wall and kind of pivot around this undercling to move up and to the right. And here we can see she kind of lose a little bit of tension and her left foot drops away from the wall. And you can see that that left foot dropping away kind of brings her hips further out from the wall. So she's going to have to compensate and pull in and kind of reset up her core and kind of pull back into the wall to fix this. You can see she hits this next hole and she's doing a good job keeping her arms straight, kind of engaged to the bat. She's looking down at her feet, moving her feet around. So so far it seems to be off to a decent start.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

And one thing that we can see is that she is still matched with both hands on the screen hold here. And I do believe she does have a high right foot as well as a lower left foot. So because her body is in a very narrow position where her hands and feet are kind of both stacked on top of each other, what this does is it helps to create a force on her where her body kind of wants to go left and right between both points of those contacts, or all four points of those contacts. So it does make it hard for her to really control what's going on with her body as she's going into this movement here. So what I would definitely recommend for this climber is because she's moving her right hand up into the next hand hold here, she needs to favor what's going on with her left hand. So in order to engage that left hand much better, I would encourage her to use her right foot on the wall. That's because they're opposite points of contact with each other, so she's able to really pivot and turn around those two points and have much better control with her body. So by hanging on with the left hand, finding a right foot that she's comfortable with, whether it's a higher foot or lower foot, and then at that point she would flag her left foot out into the left. And what this does is it will help her to encourage another back step position that she has been doing earlier on in this boulder attempt, and it would allow her to kind of be able to reach up into this right hand move with a little bit more ease, as opposed to trying to fight against herself because she's in an imbalanced position. And so here we can see that the Clamor was able to bump her right hand up into the next hand hold here. She is essentially in the same position of hanging on with that left hand as well as that right foot. So she is still technically in that back step position. But one thing that was different about this position here is that originally committing to this move, she did actually have her left foot on the same foot hold that her right foot is on, but as soon as she committed to doing the move, her left foot kind of just kicked up and into the air and you can hear an audible thud. So this kind of tells me that the Clamor wasn't entirely comfortable on just relying on one foot to complete the movement for her. So she did find the need to have to try and use two feet on a foot hold, but it ended up turning out that she just was kicking a foot, which is also another way of kind of getting some power in her movements. So it did work out for her, but I would definitely encourage most Clamors to find good control and understanding of how to move themselves with only placing one foot on a foot hold while the other foot is flagging. So that could just be something that the Clamor needs to learn, but she was able to complete this movement overall. So here we can see the climber was able to make the first move of bringing her left hand over into this handhold right here. In this position she is hanging on with a right hand in an underclink position right here. She is also utilizing two feet which is going to be a left foot here as well as a right foot there. So one of the good things that I am seeing in this position here is the climber is able to really rotate her body. That mainly comes from allowing her knees to be pointed over to the right. So what this does is it helps to encourage the rotation of her hips so that the left side of her hips get closer to the wall. Which in turn allows the distance with her left hand to be closer to the hold that she is aiming for. So this is a really good position and it helps to reinforce her engaging that right hand underclink. So this is a good position overall to see from the climber. And so here we can see that the climber was able to move her left hand into the next handhold So she's now matched on the same handhold and in that position She was starting off by hanging on with the right hand here And then what I like about the climber she was able to work her feet so that her left foot is now Directly underneath her right hand and again because they're opposite points of contact with each other It does allow her to get really good control of her center of gravity Especially with the use of a flagging foot right here So this is a really good position to see and again Like I was mentioning earlier is the climber really took the time to adjust her feet to get to this position Because originally she was not in this position But she really committed to moving her feet before moving her hand which really set her up for this position So that she was ready for any additional movement that it Occurred as she moved her left hand up And so here we can see the clown was able to bring her right hand over into the next hand hold here So in this position, this is what we call a back step position in which she's hanging on with her left hand She has a opposite foot which is gonna be her right foot just placed underneath it And then she's also utilizing a left flagging foot So in this position it helps to promote the use of her lower body Because she can help to rotate and pivot around that point so that the right side of her body gets close to the wall And again, this helps to encourage the use of her lower body because we can see that with her arm on their left arm She's not having to pull or engage on it So this shows how much she's using her lower body for this movement to just kind of get the rotation going I mean, this is a really good strong technique for any person of any size and any strength Um, so I would definitely encourage most climbers to learn to learn this technique", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}
