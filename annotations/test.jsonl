Now, what should be done here, it could be one of two things. One, sharpen the blade on the anjali, or two, to use a chef's knife and a cutting board. Either way, the blades need to be very, very sharp, especially when cutting tomatoes. Here the anjali works very well for cutting the cucumber. However, it's always recommended when you are cutting any round vegetables that you generally cut them in half, in this case lengthwise for the cucumber, and put the flat side down on the cutting board. That way you eliminate any potential for rolling of the vegetable and also the potential for cutting yourself if that happens. So oil and seasonings were added to the tomatoes and cucumbers, which is fabulous. You want to do seasonings. However, the individual did not taste the finished product to see if seasonings were adjusted correctly. So always at the end of making any dish, the dish should be tasted and seasonings adjusted accordingly. What I notice here is that the blade of the Anjali might be a bit dull because you can see him having to pull the cucumber away from the blade after the cut is made.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

The dancer is also looking down here, which is not he does this quite a bit through the routine And he sees the floor in his view Which should not be the case. He should be looking straight ahead, especially as an ending position It's not very strong to be looking downward This is another example of the dancer's arms being bent right now. It's only slightly bent. It's better but not completely straight. But we see that his arm is in a bit of a curve so he really needs to work on straightening those elbows completely. The dancer continues to look downward. He really should be looking straight ahead. He's changing his spinal alignment because his vertebrae is aligned from his waist to his shoulders but then his neck is tilted forward so it's misaligned here. The dancer is turning on flat feet. He needs to be turning on his toes with his heel instead lifted off the ground The dancer is starting the routine right before the actual choreography begins with great energy. He's shimmying his shoulders to a great extent. He's stepping down with a lot of authority in his movement, so that's really good that he's starting on this energy level so long as he sustains it throughout. The dancer does not extend his left arm here fully. It should be in a straight line. Also, in looking downward like this, he blocks his face with his right arm. His right arm is right in front of him and his eyes are at the same level as his arms. So from an audience perspective and watching, it would be hard to see his face because his arm is basically blocking his face. The dancer exits his ending pose very quickly. He had his arms out to the side. Towards his left, he brings them down quickly. So it's not really clear that the routine is over, especially because it's the last step of the dance. He really wants to end strongly and should be holding that pose. Again, the dancer's arms are bent and not extended all the way.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She also uses it to square her body up, pulls that right knee, everything's in line with the basket. Here you get, here's a good look of the guide hand coming off that left hand, shooting hand behind the ball. Really working hard here again, good footwork here to get this really nice angle. She's not too far out, not too far under. Nice, nice look here. Again, good footwork, push off that left foot. I really wish she could drive this right knee up. It's nothing wrong with what she's doing. Let's drive that right knee up to lift us even further. Again, she's a little, you know, a little close here to the rim. Maybe a little bit too close, but good extension here. I love she's got that shooting hand behind the basketball. She may be a little too close to the rim here to finish off the glass. Again, nice footwork, left foot take off, pull that right knee up. Good extension of the right arm, the shooting arm, elbows extended, shooting hand behind the basketball, balls out in front of that hand, eyes are up. Good angle here to finish. Here's that lift and extension. Nice. Let's snap that wrist down. The ball's in a pretty good position here to go in. Extends those hips and legs. Nice job. But does finish strong here. Good extension here. A little better snapping follow-through. That ball is out in front of that hand, which is what you want to see. She's got that arm bar out here to help balance her body. Maybe bend it a little bit, kind of at 90 degree, potentially hold off a defender there. uses a big dribble here to push off, right leg going up, maybe a little off balance here, maybe went off a little bit too soon here, that's something I was thinking about in her scoring. Sometimes her takeoff's a little too soon, doesn't allow her to have the angle to finish, so she's really having to put the ball in the palm of her hand and kinda lift the ball up just because of the footwork spacing is a little off here. Yeah, much better take off here. She can really pull that right hip up. Does a good job of really squaring up her body. Gets that shooting hand behind the basketball. Very well done. Again, here she took off a little bit too soon, maybe in front of the rim a little bit too much, but does a great job of planning the correct foot. It's just the spacing here, you know, what the angle we're trying to achieve here. Again, takes it up with two hands, much more a strong basketball player here, better control, better stability here. I love she's looking up, keeping her eye on the target. Here's that shot. Again, love how she's got her hand behind the ball. You see the fingers nice and spread, balls out in front of her. She's got some ups here too. She can really get up off the ground and very well done. Beautiful look here. Really does a great job of extending and reaching balls out in front. Very nice. Beautiful footwork. Here's that bent right knee lifting. Good power and up. She's going hard. I like that. Nice job. Here the shooter is moving left to right, shooting a right hand reverse layup. Pretty good timing and spacing here, going off the correct foot, the left foot, and raising that right knee. I like how she's also pivoting on the left foot, and it kind of gets her square to the baseline or to the basket. She's got that guide hand on the left side of the ball with that right hand. It's hard to see the right hand, but it looks like it might be a little under the ball. Would love it to be more behind the ball, but I love how she takes it up with two hands. She's strong, aggressive here, really doing a good job of stabilizing that ball for the shot. Uh, it looks like that ball slipped out of her hand here. You can tell it's going to hit rim. So again, you know, I don't know why sometimes it slips. Keeping that left hand on there a little bit longer, spreading the fingers on the basketball, keeping your eye on this target. It looks like her footwork looks really good here. It's just she's off target here. And, you know, her momentum, I mean, she's hitting that square. It's nice, but look where she is. Because she's coming full speed here. Again, it's all about, you know, being explosive, going game speed, but at the same time, you know, you don't want to land way under the basket. You know, the reason why is that ball could be missed. You're out of position, if you will. She's a little off balance. Might take her a little time more to recover. So not an easy thing to do. I mean, as she goes up, she's got to be able to come down and not let that momentum really take her out of bounds. Again, it's working hard to get this angle. Much better angle spacing here. See where that, instead of planning here, she planned it here. I love the guide hand, help take it up and then it comes off. See that? She had two hands lifting. Left hand is there, comes off softly. Good lift here. Good angle, good spacing. See how she's lifting it, that hand's under the ball. Again, it's gonna throw off some of the accuracy here. And then you can see how her feet are kind of, she's pushing off, but that right leg's really pulled out to the right. We want to square our hips, our torso to the basket. Here's the finish. Does got some up here. I love how she's getting up. Good extension of the shooting elbow. We'd like that her to snap that wrist down though and follow through. Put the balls in a good position here to hit the rim and go in. She is leaning here a little bit. Okay though, she's got, she had a lot of momentum coming in here. Just continue to balance yourself. Have good body control. You got to be able to be go, be able to go hard and fast but at the same time have some poise and body control.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So in this position the climber is hanging on with the right hand here, as well as utilizing a right foot in this position. So because the climber is using two points of contact and on the same side of his body, this naturally places his body in an imbalanced position, where his body kind of wants to rotate around those two points. So what the climber has to do is a couple things in order to compensate for that. One of the things is utilizing a flagging foot, so his left foot is flagging out to the right. And what this does is it helps to bring a little bit of his body weight over into the right side of those two points of contact. So in that way there's a little bit less of an imbalance going on. And then on top of that the climber is forced to have to pull in with his right arms, because we do see his right arm is in a very flexed position. And this is mainly to try and keep his body forward and central to the wall, so that way again he's not rotating outwards and to the right. So this does require a lot of power and a lot of energy to be able to accomplish a move like this. So this can make it a little bit more difficult to complete his boulder if he continues climbing into moves like this. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring his right hand over into this next handhold. So he's now matched on it. And in this position, what we can see the climber doing is he's making sure that a lot of his body weight is directly underneath his left arm before bringing in his right hand, which is always a good thing to see. So what the climber is able to do is kind of push out with his right foot in order to transition his body weight over to the left. And again, that's to prevent any further swinging from occurring as he brings his right hand up into this next handhold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

But you can see how, how like the strength of that turn, not really efficient. Like he's over, over hitting the ball with too much pace, which causes him to now overextend. And you have this really stretched position here where he has limited contact with the, with the ground. He has no force going into the ground because his feet are so wide. So like he's not moving anywhere essentially at this point. He's just trying to overcorrect and catch the ball at this point, which is slowing down the entire action and his ability to control the ball. So consistent theme with him, slow down, keep the ball in front of your body, use a consistent surface to touch the ball out in front of your body and try to move with the ball. And then gradually as he becomes more comfortable, he can gain speed. So for a dribbling activity, him popping the ball up into the air right here and trying to juggle it is actually not part of it. I just wanted to point that out that if it were evaluating dribbling, this wouldn't be a technique that we would use. We want that ball down on the ground and him dribbling the ball and moving with it in a forward direction. So this is a move that he's constantly using or a skill as he gets into this stance here. You see this leg knee bent Loaded and he keeps the ball far away from his body and the outside of it as opposed to close to him and he's doing that by putting his foot on top of the ball and then rolling this foot off the ball and Now that puts them on the inside of his foot This would be actually like a useful skill if it were a shielding activity If you imagine a player being right here That would protect the ball a lot by giving a lot of space between where the ball is and the opponent and he's in a Good balanced position to make contact with that opponent and fend that opponent off So that's what this skill would be really useful for in terms of like just dribbling efficiently through a space and turning I it's not really one that we would practice or recommend But again, just pointing out what this skill is and critiquing the skill from what that looks like He's quite comfortable and in the shielding almost like a shielding skill To keep the ball away from an opponent Yeah, this is a good picture for a sole roll. You can see that his body is leaning in this direction, hips moving that way, upper body is moving that way. But I like that his head's down, it's tracking the ball and he's got his arms out to the side on both sides here. That helps for balance. And he's contacting the ball at the top and rolling it over with his sole, the bottom of his foot across the front of his body. And that's good. And you see that back foot is pivoted already in the direction that he wants to go. So I like that. And this is a good picture then for a sole roll of what it should look like, nice and clean. And this is kind of what's happening again continuously throughout the activity because he's trying to move faster with his feet and his body than he's actually manipulating the ball. He gets caught ahead of the ball at this point and now the ball is underneath him and he's very off balance. Everything in his body is going this way and he has no control of the ball at this point because he's not contacting the ball. So slowing down would help him and also keeping the ball in front of him and using a consistent technique to do that, whether that be the instep or the laces that just push the ball every step forward. I think that would really help him to be able to move more efficiently and with more control. A little useful skill here in changing direction as he's going this way here and then trying to go this way here next. Just using a top of the foot or bottom of the foot sole pull or a turn. He's dragging the ball backwards here this direction by placing his foot directly on top of the ball in the center part of it and just pulling it backwards towards his body. So a really effective way to do that. I like his upper body here. Got a nice forward lean. See the knees bent nice and soft there. So he can turn and pivot on that plant foot pretty quickly then from this position. Yeah, here, I mean, he's just doing turns with the ball here. In terms of like dribbling, this is just a technique to keep the ball away from a direct opponent if somebody was trying to get him. He's actually showing okay balance as he's doing this. I don't mind it. It's not really related to what we've seen so far from him. This is sort of a one-off, but a nice technique where he's just catching it with the inside of his foot and dragging it around his body here and almost doing a 360 with the ball. He's keeping that ball nice and tight to him. It's a little bit underneath him at this point. He would likely need to start pivoting on this foot a little bit more, a little more this way actually and start turning that heel this way to bring his body in that direction. The subject's performing a close control, freestyle dribbling activity where just in the space pretty much he can sort of dribble anywhere he wants to go using any skill that he wants to. The four cones that are laid out don't necessarily have any indication of like an exercise or what he should be doing. It's just he can kind of go wherever he wants to go and use whatever surface of the foot that he wants to. So we'll evaluate his control, his ability to run with the ball, his ability to turn, his balance, his coordination with the ball. These are the things that we'll try to look at as we go through this video. Yeah, I mean, this is what you don't want to have happen in this, in a dribbling exercise like this, as that ball gets away from you, it's very far off because he took a very strong touch as he tried to soul roll and catch the ball there. Now the ball's going outside of the cones, coned area, or so he's lost control of it. And so this is just, again, slowing his actions down a little bit. His feet are trying to move a lot faster than how he's manipulating the ball and what he's actually capable of considering his skill level and ability. So I would just recommend that he slow down and try to be a little bit more calmer, keep the ball out in front of him, keep it close to his body, and perhaps simplify some of the touches that he's taking. He could do that by just giving himself some direction. If he started here and dribbled to here and then turned and then restarted and went back the other direction, perhaps that could be a lot easier way for him to get some good repetition at a skill and keep it in front of him, more like running in a game. He gets stuck in these moments at times by just trying to take too many touches with his inside or sole of the foot. And here, this is an off balance moment where he's trying to contact the ball with his right foot. That right foot is basically on top of his left foot. As you can see, and that left knee is like inward, it's caving in this direction here, actually. So he's very off balance. Upper body is leaning this way as he's trying to push the ball and go that way as opposed to leaning in the direction that he wants to go, which would be preferred. So sometimes these moments, if he just slows down and what he's trying to do and not do it at such a fast speed, I think it would benefit a lot to keep that ball out in front of him. And if the ball is going to come across his body like this, it's okay to just use that left foot to control it, keep better balance with that right foot, keep his hips more aligned in the direction that he's trying to go. So right away, he's using an inside the foot technique where he's going across his body, across his body with the inside of the foot as he's just dribbling throughout the space. And one thing that just happened as you're doing that, you can see that he hit it across his body to his right foot and he wants to do the same thing to keep moving to bring it back to his left foot. But where he's striking the ball is very high on the ball. You can see like this is the center line of the ball. He's striking it very high in the ball, which will end up being more of a sole roll across his body, which he's not intentionally trying to do because if it was a sole roll, he would lean much more in that direction and roll the ball with him as he moves in that direction. But you can see in the picture that he's very upright. So this is just, this is going to lead to an error. And so what I would just recommend that if he's going to dribble with the inside of his feet only, that he tried to contact the ball very consistently in the center part of the ball to get it to come across his body.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This will help the climber to drive the force of direction and closeness to the hold when going up for the leap to the next hold. The climb will start until the feet are placed onto the wall. At this point, none of the limbs and his body is touching the mat. That means that the climb will start. As we can see, both of the feet are positioned at a high stance, and as we can see also, the climber is bringing his center of gravity low by keeping the arms extended and not engaging on the shoulders. The next hold, seeming to be a hold that is far away, will make the climber have to engage into a dynamic, powerful stance. This is called a dyno. If the climber was going to do this again, it's important that he focuses on the right application when at the grips down below and also on the foot placement. This one because when the climber gets to make a full stance and keeps his chest forward as he once did, it's important that he lets his center of gravity be lined on top of the right foot. Because the climber has reached a certain height when taking up the flight, he needs to press down on the right foot and continue to engage his core to stay close to the wall following the movement of the chest. In this case, the climber had pressed down on the right foot, but the right foot had slipped off. It was crucial that the climber keeps the pressure on it and stays as close as he can to the wall to avoid from bringing his center of gravity away from the wall and having to land on the mat before reaching the hold. The climber is shaking his hands. This is potentially because the climber had already attempted to climb and so is shaking the hands to release any tension that might have been built up as well as warming up the grip. The climber has pressed down on the right foot and it slipped out of the hold. Due to pressing down on the foot prematurely, we can see how the climber's center of gravity is being forced away from the wall. This will not help the climber to engage on a forceful, dynamic move to reach up to the hold. In this case, the climber might be able to just touch the hold without being able to engage any gripping power. The climber sustaining the grips will need to lower his center of gravity as far as he can, this applying pressure at the feet that are placed on the wall. A dyno is when the climber makes a dynamic move that uses momentum, which he is creating by swinging left to right or engaging into small pull-ups until he is ready to come out and uses that movement to go up to the next hold. He needs to make sure that he places exactly where his right hand that's going up will be aiming and the edge of the hold. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start. As we can see, each hold being a donut, the climber is able to wrap the fingers around the hold, at least in the bottom area of the holds. Now to create pressure on the fingers that are placed in the inside of the hold, the climber must lean down in order to create pressure with his body weight and to sustain the grip, he engages the thumbs that are placed on the outside of the holds to create more gripping power.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The violist obviously missed their entrance and the first violin waited for them very professionally Really nice change in dynamic structure here in the main violin while the viola took over briefly for that moment The spectacular octaves in the violin, very in tune and very intense, sounded great. Very obvious moment where there's an ostinato pattern happening in the viola while there's another type of pattern happening in the violin But I don't understand how they're connected They just sound like two separate musicians playing at the same time as opposed to a unified group The held out notes here in the viola I think are just a little stagnant, maybe even a little stale. You can see that they're keeping that bow pretty much right in the middle of their contact point, which gets a really strong solid sound, but they're trying to play underneath this higher melody and they could afford to move this bow closer to the fingerboard and have a little bit more control over the types of sounds that they're gonna create with this harmony section. The ensemble here fell apart just slightly, but they seem to have noticed and gotten back on track pretty well. A viola musician here tends to have a wrist that's a little too far up for my taste. You can see a lot of palm. You can see in comparison to the violinist here, the palm is a little bit more hidden. I would allow, I would tell the student to move this palm down and out so that the thumb could be less visible here as well. You would see just the tip of the thumb like you see here on the other musician. Notice how this musician here uses the bow at an up bow and actually decreases in dynamic here even though they're traveling to the frog. That implies that they're aware of the other musician and creating more phrasal structure. That's really pleasing to focus on. On simple struggles here for a sec. Trills tend to have a tough time being phrased. No difference here. They just kind of sounded like flutter notes that didn't really go anywhere in relation to the violin. I would advise practicing just the notes without the trill and see if you can follow the phrase with the first violin before adding the trills. Excellent group diminuendo and relaxing of energy here. energies in the two musicians are matched pretty well here. A good suggestion for this section would be to find the notes in the lower musician that matches or harmonizes well with the upper musician and emphasize those with him. Um, Ensemble feels a little weird here. Great start so far. Musicians look like they're seated properly, front of the chair, leaning forward, not in the back of the chairs. Both hands look like they're well set up as well. Violas here tends to have a little bit of a pop in that first finger when they're playing the third finger. This is indicative of extra weight or energy happening in a part of the finger or hand that's not needed. I would advise trying to keep this finger closer to the fingerboard to be ready at a moment's notice. Viola intonation here is wrong. There's some really nice phrasing going on with this musician here, but the accompanimental part here just seems to be staying pretty Steady and Monotone I would like to hear this musician match what's happening with the phrase with the other musician a little more here Really nice transfer from musician to musician here when they have that descending structure passing back and forth between each other Really nice ball hold in this musician. Solid fingers on this on the stick with a nice curve around the first finger part of the stick and then the pinky you can tell is right on top. Another really great curve of this finger on the other musician. However, you can tell that that thumb underneath this is buckled in and should be curved out instead. Really good conversation between these two musicians.

Also allow the balls to be closer towards the designated target, which is going to be the rim. As we look at the player's release on the right side of the frame, again, we will want the player to jump, giving the ball more lift and power it needs to get above the defense, and also to endure potential contact in the game-like scenario. The player does do a good job of getting the ball above his shoulders in the high release, and a great job of scoring his shoulders towards our designated target, which is the rim. The player does a good job as we look on the left side of the frame on his release having his follow through directed towards our targeted area which guides the ball to be able to hit our target which is going to be the top right corner of the box on the backboard allowing the ball to be able to hit the ball.

The player also does a solid job, as we look on the right frame again, of having his ball placement position leveled by his chest area. A slight improvement we can make is bringing the ball placement position even higher to create more ball control on the finish and also develop more ball security and protection. As we look on the left side of the frame on our player's release, we can notice that the player does really well at having his follow through rotated towards our targeted area, which allows and guides the ball towards our designated target. We will be able to drop through the net, resulting in a completed layup attempt. As we look on the right frame, as the player is going into his gather for his left-handed reverse layup attempt, again, we will want the player to bring his ball placement security higher towards his shoulder area to allow more ball security and to bring the ball closer towards our targeted area, creating a much easier finish. As we look on the right frame on our player's release, again, what will help the player be able to get a quicker release is to have the player jump with maximum effort, guiding his body's momentum towards the right side of the rim. As we look at the player go into his right-handed reverse layup attempt, again, the player does a good job at incorporating the proper footwork by jumping off his left leg, and also does a good job, as we can look on the left side of the frame, having his follow-through hand directing the ball towards our targeted area, which is going to be around the top right corner on the backboard, allowing the ball to create an easier angle of dropping inside the rim.

You want it to be more of a flick up the wrist and powering up straight up, which is going in a circular motion. Right here we want to make sure we're not jumping off too far in the miking drill. This drill is designed to go off on foot. I think it's a pretty good location on the backboard, entering the white box, but just not elevating high enough nor doing the fundamentals of the drill correctly.

The ball hits outside the side of the square. It also has a good height. It's near the top of the square. But since it's outside of the square, we need good side spin on the ball in order for it to spin into the basket. And on this attempt, the player, he put good side spin on this one and it was able to spin off the backboard and into the basket. The player here shows the correct footwork by making sure that he jumps off of his left foot for the right hand reverse layup. As you can see here, he has his hand underneath the ball and his arm is extended out away from his frame. Again, the player shows good footwork by jumping off of the correct foot, the left foot, his left foot, which is the correct foot. You can't see his right knee because he's not lifting up his right knee. So the fact that he's not lifting up his right knee, that lets you know that he is not going full speed and he's not giving maximum effort on his jump in order to explode up high to the basket. So even though everything is technically correct, if we're not going full speed, we're not in a position to improve ourselves and improve our game. So it's really important that when we do the reverse layup and we're practicing that we really drive that right knee up to our waist level on the jump. That way it simulates a game-like situation. The player does a good job of placing the ball nicely at the top right corner of the box. Excuse me, the top right corner of the square on the backboard. So if we were to hit this spot and we will have little to no side spin it will go nice and easy into the basket. However, on this attempt the shooter, he put a lot of side spin on the ball so when it hit the backboard it's spent and we end up missing it long to the left side of the rim.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So that way everything is not square to the front, as well as moving up on her toes a little bit more as she crosses over. So overall, really nice job with this one. Everything was really smooth. I think the energy could have definitely went up a little bit just to elevate for the full performance, but overall, really nice job and good example. So here the dancer starts stepping in place with the basic choreography. She gets her feet slightly off the floor, keeping the energy nice and light. The knees are bent slightly, and as well as a really nice rotation in her arms and shoulders. So for her turns, really nice job on all four turns spotting, so keeping that head facing forward until she gets all the way around. She doesn't whip as hard, but it's a really clean, smooth whip around, and she's able to control her balance in her steps as she turns. And again, when she steps forward, try not to shift that whole foot on the floor, but push more on her toe. And then making sure both knees are bent as she's stepping forward and back, so keeping a nice groundedness to her floor, to the feet and the floor. So here when she steps out to the side, again, she keeps this light. Try to get that heel off the floor when she steps out, I would suggest. And also kind of pushing the hips out a little bit more. I think she can give a little bit more movement in her hips. But again, nice job keeping the knees nice and bent, and then good rotation in the arms.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So you just want to make sure, you either shift it over to the left if you're lefty, or shift it over to the right if you're righty, or just bring it up either side for a consistent jump shot of the tilt. Right here, look as if she's potentially shooting with two hands. Both follow throughs are going down with this thumb sticking up, which indicates it could be a very high possibility of her using two hands for the jump shot. And that's not how you typically shoot a jump shot. Right here, landing like this is definitely not recommended. It's almost like she's walking. So as you jump, you want to land on two, not on one or the other. The first thing that stands out is foot separation. Bounce feet too close together. Either for a jump shot or a free throw. Right here, this kind of confirms that the attempt is with two hands, whereas these two fingers are going to be bumping heads with these other two fingers, which you would call a lack of rotation. So it would be a very stiff ball, probably hard being that close and shooting with two hands, but you kind of want to figure that out and have a strong hand and an off hand. Right here, one foot is in front of the other, so we'll potentially come down off balance. You want to make sure you come down wherever you began or slightly, you know, forward. Right here, the ball is in a good position where it's not blocking her view, so that's a pretty good job there.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So there's a non-kicking foot making contact with the ball while in front. So as we're making that impact with the ball we're already on a kind of forward follow through action with the ball. You can see the contact with the ball is very low so that's going to impact the trajectory of the ball. Within the low half of the ball is going to make the ball want to naturally travel on an upwards trajectory. And it's also, you can see the body is already starting to lean a little bit back but is not really utilising his upper body for any additional balance, control, power or momentum through the strike. Again, limited approach for the player, more of static ball, one step, so coming very square behind the line. We'll say here that the foot is in a much better position, heel, sorry, toe level with the front of the ball, good distance between the ball and the non-kicking foot, which is going to help in terms of the player getting his body moving through the line of the shot, also improves our ability to get this back lift through the line of the ball. You can see the striking leg, the right leg, has come from a very straight position, very far back, so we're not utilising our body to help with our balance to get our back lift up and really generate additional power, control and outcome in the shot. Again, just looking at impact, so the player, because of the non-kicking foot, it's going to impact what the player is able to do with the right foot. You can see again the toe is really pointing down to the ground on contact, so we're going to be impacting the part of the ball we want to make contact with. For the maximum control, we want to try and hit through the middle of the ball, the inside curvature of the foot. You see again, because the player is reaching forward to make contact with the ball, the body is leaning back behind the line of the ball, so as we're leaning back, that takes our head behind the line of the ball, that's going to naturally, alongside the part of the ball we want to make contact with, get the ball travelling on an upwards trajectory, so we lose elements of control and power through the strike. Again, player very limited in his approach. He's approaching the ball at a slight angle. Again, we can see the non-kicking foot well behind the line of the ball in terms of the front of the ball. And again, this is dictated a little bit by the position of the non-kicking foot pointing well outside the line of the goal. So now our follow-through action and our contact is gonna really be based on the angle of the foot and the part of the ball we're gonna make contact with and the follow-through action, which is controlled a little bit by that non-kicking foot is gonna have its impact also. So I wanna make sure we get our non-kicking foot alongside the ball, toe level with the front of the ball so we can get our follow-through action coming through the line of the shot. And you can see, so player keeps his foot in a locked position, straight leg on that follow through, following through in that direction. So that's helping control both on the contact with the ball and that immediate follow through action is helping direct the ball. But again, the body is not really being utilized for any element of the shot, more just the follow through action, the right leg and the contact with the ball. Again, the follow-through action, so you can see again the player keeps his foot in a locked position, looks like a straight leg coming through the ball in the general direction the ball is going. Again, you can see the leg curling slightly away to the left, but the body is more being utilised this time you can see for the position of the arms, maintaining balance, getting his body moving forward, more in line with that standing foot so we can generate more elements of power by utilising our body in that way. Here again the player maybe a little bit more of a preparation here, kind of a little jump, not very far, a couple of inches, but he is approaching the ball from a slight angle which is going to help in just terms of opening up his body to rotate through the ball. Again we can see the non-kicking foot is not in a great position, we want that non-kicking foot to be alongside the ball, toes level with that front of the ball so we create this number 10 shape between the non-kicking foot and where the position of the ball is. The distance between the foot and the ball is going to really affect the player's ability to make contact with the ball. Again you can see from the upright position of the player, he's not really utilising his upper body to open up his body, open his hips, back lift is very shallow, so although that doesn't necessarily guarantee power, the power comes from the technical action of contact with the ball, follow through with the back lift can help really generate that momentum through the ball and get the balance of the body moving through the ball. I do like that the player maintains visual contact on the ball throughout the strike, so regardless of the approach, the player is really focused on a specific part of the ball, hopefully that can help him control the direction of the pass. very little preparation for the player non-kicking foot again in a position that doesn't necessarily help the player with his technical actions, toe well behind the line of the ball we want the foot alongside the ball the toe level with the front of the ball if not slightly in front and we want a three-quarters to full balls width between the foot and the ball to allow for good range of motion through the line of the ball with the right foot again we'd like to see the player stepping and approaching the ball from an angle so we can really generate additional momentum control and power by utilizing the whole of the body here the player because of the way they step into the ball you see the body is very upright we're really reliant on everything coming from the leg that's striking the ball Again, just looking at the contact with the ball so we can see the non-kicking foot pointing towards the right, the left foot toe pointing down and really hitting more closer to the ankle heel part of the foot with the ball which is a harder surface, an outer rounded surface so that's going to impact the direction of the ball. We don't necessarily have full control over where that ball is going, we want to hit through the inside curvature of the foot through the middle of the ball to maximise the surface area that we make contact with to maximise the control that we have. Obviously we're also reaching forwards in front of our body so we're making contact as we're on that upwards follow through motion so the amount of power and control we generate through that follow through motion is going to be limited and we can also see that we're not really utilising our upper body, our arms are really down by our side so we're not maintaining additional balance or momentum by opening up our hips and rotating our body through the ball. Again here, player doesn't approach the ball, doesn't step into the ball, more stops the ball and comes from a static position. So again, we can see the non-kicking foot not in a great position. We want that non-kicking foot beside the ball, create the number 10 shape, get the toe level with the front of the ball, three quarter to a full ball's width between the ball and the non-kicking foot to give ourselves options and momentum. And with the foot so close to the ball, is going to restrict what we can do with the right leg. So we always want to encourage players to approach the ball from a side angle, step into that ball to really open up their body, be able to generate some power and control. Looking at the contact with the ball and the foot so we can see again the player because of the non-kicking foot well behind the line of the ball when they're reaching in front the foot is obviously angling to redirect the direction of the ball and see the toe is pointing downwards so we're going to be hitting the lower half of the ball so it's going to affect both the trajectory the quality of the strike and we're also making contact with the ball on our way up so it's not a problem we're striking the ball with a straighter leg that's actually going to help with the power and control but we're going to try and hit the ball as our leg is vertically straight and down from the lower leg to really maximize the action of the follow-through in the backswing again because the ball is in front of the standing leg makes it difficult for the players body momentum to be moving forward so we want to try and get our body leaning slightly forward through the strike get our head over the ball get our body moving forwards in the line that the ball is traveling We can look on the contact with the ball again the heel is up, toe is down that's going to impact the part of the ball that we make contact with so we want the toe to be pointing slightly up to lock our ankle. Again part of the issue here is how close the ball is to the non kicking foot so we really don't want the lower leg pointing inwards towards that non kicking foot because that's naturally going to get the foot in that position even if the ankle is locked, toes still going to be pointing down it's going to impact the contact point with the ball so the distance between the non kicking foot and the ball is important so we get the lower part of the leg going directly down from the knee not coming inside because now obviously we're angling our foot towards the ball and our foot's in a position it's not going to help us with the genuine contact. Again body position very upright very tall so there's no element of follow through and movement through the line of the ball to help control the power and accuracy of the shot. Player looking to strike with the left foot, again no real approach or preparation for the ball, kind of just a little stutter step to get the right foot in position as he prepares to strike with the left. See the non-kicking foot pointing well outside the line of the goal and this is going to affect our balance, our control, our final position, our hip placement, body position in the follow-through. We can also see obviously it's not in a position alongside the ball, Colm's obviously also in a position in the way so we haven't prepared the ball correctly, get our toe alongside the front of the ball, create that number 10 shape between the non-kicking foot and the ball and get the distance right so now we're going to be reaching in front of our body to make contact, it's going to affect all elements of our balance and control through the strike. Again, no real approach for the player, just kind of turning and stepping alongside the ball without actually stepping in. So there's no angle of approach per se, just more putting the left foot in a position. So you see that the toe is in line with the front of the ball, but there's a way too big of a gap between the non-kicking foot and the ball. And especially with no run up or approach to really get. You see there's no back lift, the player's leg is just coming from a very static position, straight position coming through the ball. The upper body is not being utilised at all, the arms aren't anywhere other than by his side, back up straight. So the player is really going to be relying on just the contact between the foot and the ball. Again, just looking at the contact point with the ball, so the player's heel pointing up, toe down. Based on the position between the ball and the non-kicking foot, it's going to change the angle of contact. So you can see because of the ball, the foot is coming through and the ball is in front of the non-kicking foot, so the foot is now angled on the side. So now we're hitting the right side of the back of the ball, which is going to control the angle and direction of the ball, not necessarily controlled by the help of the body position. So we want our non-kicking foot to be pointing in the direction we want the ball to go, our hips and our chest to be pointing in the direction we want to go, so we can really maximise the follow-through and contact with the ball. And you see the follow through action. So based on the contact point between the ball, the angle of the foot, that generally is controlling the outcome. You see the follow through here, the foot changes its position from being pointing out, heel locked, toe down, to very quickly turning and coming across his body. So the follow through action is not helping in terms of controlling the intended outcome and direction of the shot. We can see there's a slight follow through action, which brings the body slightly further forward, but the control actually shows more determined by the angle of the foot and the contact point on the ball. And just looking at the contact, we can see again the toe is pointing down towards the ground on contact and we're also making contact with the ball on the follow through again because the non-kicking foot is behind the line of the ball. As we're stepping and approaching to the ball it's going to affect the timing and the contact point between the right foot and the ball. And again the body's not being utilised so any power or control is really being generated from the right foot and the right leg. The body's not being utilised in the motion. Again, making contact with the ball inside of the right foot, toe pointing down, which is going to affect the exact point of the ball when the toe is pointing down and not slightly up. We're not going to be hitting genuinely through the middle of the ball. It's always going to be the lower half of the ball. So we lose elements of control and power. You can see again, the angle of the foot is going to really control because there's no angle of approach. There's no body momentum moving through. So it's all going to be based on this contact point. So hitting the ball, right side of the ball, angled foot is going to veer the ball back towards the left through the center. So the body position really doesn't affect the control of the shot. You can see the body is upright. Arms are really just down by his side, not really being utilized for any momentum control or balance. And so no real power in this shot or control over the actual point of contact with the ball. So you see the player in a very upright body position. No follow through, just landing on the left foot that makes contact with the ball. Kind of just half, half kind of steps through the line of the shot. Here you see the player in his follow-through action steps through the line of the ball. Again because he's hitting the ball in front of his standing leg, this foot has to quickly come down to the ground just to re-establish the balance. You can see the player's body momentum is still moving forward through the line of the shot which is good. But it's more just with his feet than his body. You can see his body is leaning back. So ideally as our feet are moving forward, we'll be moving our body forward, keeping our hips and our chest aligned with the trajectory and the direction that we want the pass to go. We can see on the follow through, just because of the position of the non-kicking foot and the balance of the body, not really utilising the upper body throughout the approach and preparation, the initial follow through is there in the line of the ball but then quickly has to tail away to the left for balance and control of his body. But you can see obviously the ball is travelling forward but the body is still leaning back and away and then the follow through action is going to be disconnected from the strike itself so we lose elements of control and power so we're really reliant now on the exact contact point between the foot and the ball to direct the outcome of where the ball is going to travel to. Looking at the point of contact again, so we can see because of how close the non-kicking foot is to the ball, you can see it's very difficult for the player to really open up his hips and utilise the surface of the foot the player is choosing. So that lower leg is bending in, that's going to naturally, regardless of whether he locks his ankle, lead to the toe pointing down. So that's going to make an impact on the part of the ball that we strike as we go through the ball, so the toe is pointing down, we're going to naturally hit a lower part of the ball and maybe more with the heel than the inside of the foot. So that non-kicking foot really impacts a lot of the different action and obviously we're also behind the line of the ball so now as we make contact the lower leg is already on its way up, which is going to again impact the quality of the strike. We can see again the body not really being utilised, it's actually leaning back because we're reaching slightly forward for the ball, not utilising our arms and our body to generate additional momentum, control and power. Looking again on contact with the ball, we can see the player utilising the inside of the foot, but really reaching out with an extended leg with the position of the ball with a non-kicking foot. So the quality of the contact is going to be limited as we're reaching out for the ball and the ball is obviously well in front of the line of the body. So any power that we are generating is going to be limited because there's going to be a limited follow-through so the player is going to have to reach forward and through the line of the shot. Again, no real approach for the player. I mean, again, see where the standing foot goes, really far behind the line of the ball. So we want this non-kicking foot to be alongside the ball, create this number 10 shape, toe level with the front of the ball as much as we can. So as we're stepping into the ball, that allows us to get our body in a better position and our body momentum to move through to generate additional control and power. So looking at the contact point of the ball, so again we can see toe still pointing slightly down to the ground, so utilising the inside of the foot. You can see the angle of the foot is still really pointing forward, so we're hitting the side of the ball or hitting the ball closer to the heel, as opposed to really punching through the middle of the ball with the inside of the foot for the maximum control and power. So we're really reliant here on the contact point between the ball and the foot as to the direction and the power and control that we generate. Again you can see the body very upright, no body momentum moving through the strike, so really just reliant on the right leg and the right foot striking through the ball. Just looking at the contact, again the non-kicking foot really dictates elements throughout the action we can see now. The player is reaching out from his body, toe is pointing downwards towards the ground, we're making contact closer to the heel, the inside of the foot obviously is angled away to the left as well so with the toe position down, hitting the ball close to the heel and the side of the ball we're really lacking some elements of control and power through the strike and again we can see on contact with the ball we're reaching out in front of our body on the follow through upwards action so there's limited power and control that we generate through the strike. and we see here the player controlling elements of the power of the shot through keeping his foot in his locked position and following through the line of the ball and we can see again that follow through is a little bit limited ideally if we're in a good position we can get through to a 90 degree angle to follow through here you can see the initial follow through with that straight leg is in the direction the ball goes but then tail is away to the left so it's going to impact the quality of the strike and we can also again see the body position player is fighting to get his body moving forward by bending this left knee forward but his body is still leaning back and away so he's very much reliant on his right leg right foot to make contact and follow through the direction of the shot Just looking at contact again, player is very consistent where he has his toe pointing down towards the ground so we're not necessarily making genuine contact through the middle of the foot and you can see a lot of the lower half of the ball is showing so we're hitting closer to the heel and that's going to affect the quality and the part of the ball that we're making contact with. Because the foot is slightly behind the line of the ball we end up reaching forward for it and we also end up with our lower leg turning inside which in turn obviously controls the direction that the toe is pointing, it's harder to point that toe slightly up and come through the ball. We can also see the body position, player not really utilising his upper body for additional range, balance and momentum through the ball so now the body is leaning back and away from the intended direction that we want the ball to go. Again, limited preparation for the player here is more of a one-step approach. Again, coming very square behind the ball. I always recommend players come at the ball from a slight angle so we can step in, utilise our body to rotate through the ball. Non-kicking foot, we want to be alongside the ball where the toe is level or slightly in front of the front of the ball. That allows us to really step into the pass, stroke, shot, get our body momentum through the ball. So you can see here the foot is behind the line of the ball so it ends up we're going to be reaching slightly in front of the body as we make contact. Distance between the ball and the non-kicking foot, we recommend three quarters to a full ball's width. So here, distance is okay in terms of the horizontal but we want the foot to be moving much further forward to help with the player's balance and control. You can also see the player not really utilising his upper body and his body well behind the line of the ball which is going to impact the player's balance as he strikes through the line of the shot. Again, limited approach from the player. He does step towards the ball here, relatively square behind the ball based on where his non-kicking foot is planted and pointing. So we can see the toe pointing towards the right side of the goal as we look at it. So based on that, player is coming very square to the ball. Again, we want the non-kicking foot alongside the ball. So based on where the toe is pointing, we'd probably expect the foot to be further forward, toe level with the front of the ball. Distance between the foot and the ball is okay. That allows us more room to bring this right leg back and through. And by stepping towards the ball, you can see allows for a slightly greater back lift and more use of the body to strike through the line of the shot. Again, player not really preparing the ball or approaching the ball to help him with the technical actions. We can see it's a kind of a small, kind of few inches step to the left to prepare. We see again the position of the non-kicking foot in terms of the toe is really back from the ball. We can see the direction of the non-kicking foot is pointing well outside the line of the goal. So that's going to impact the player's action, his follow through, his contact with the ball. So we want to get this foot alongside the ball, create this number 10 shape between the non-kicking foot and the ball itself. That's going to help in the following actions. We can see there's a slight back lift for the player preparing to strike through, but the player is utilizing none of his upper body to open up his body, open up his hips to strike through the line of the shot. see here the players follow through generates more of the power and control so the straight leg keeps his foot locked in this position so that's better from the player but again very limited in terms of the approach to the ball so he's really focused on using that inside of the foot with the right foot and the the motion of the leg through the ball to get the control and power that the player is generating not really much generated from the body throughout the motion of the approach and the strike The player utilising his left foot, so here the ball is rolling a little bit, doesn't actually move his left foot in preparation to striking the ball. So it's always important in preparation for a strike that we're stepping into the shot from a side angle to really provide us with the opportunity to get our back lift and our follow through action coming through the ball. So, player here not really approaching the ball or stepping to the ball. You see his body is very upright. So there's no preparation in terms of the strike. On contact with the ball again, you can see the angle of the foot is going to make contact. So regardless of the non-kicking foot, because it's not really been placed to prepare for the shot, the direction of this ball is really going to be controlled by the angle of the foot, the part of the ball we're making contact with, and then a little bit of the follow through action. Player utilising the inside of the foot, we can see on contact the player again because of the non-kicking foot is planted behind the line of the ball, just naturally the player if he's using the inside of his foot is going to be now already extending his leg on the upwards follow through action with the ball. So it's going to limit the power that we can generate. We can also see the foot is making contact again with the lower half of the ball which is going to affect the trajectory of the ball coming off the ground and up. So again depending on the player's intention that could be purposeful or not. And then you see the body again very upright, not really utilising, you see from his arms there's no body momentum moving through the ball so all the power and control is really coming from the contact point with the foot and the ball and the general momentum of the striking leg. Again, player very limited in his approach, non-kicking foot, planting well behind the line of the ball. We want that non-kicking foot alongside the ball to create that number 10 shape, toe level with the front of the ball, slightly in front. Distance is not too bad, but again, really behind the line of the ball, which is gonna lead to the right foot now having to extend in front of the body, reaching for the ball, which is gonna affect the outcome of the quality of the strike. You can also see the toe pointing towards the outer part of the goal. So in terms of the position of the ball, the position of the non-kicking foot is gonna impact the complete action and the follow-through motion with the hips and the body. Again, player kind of slow approach to the ball, no real preparation. Just take a slight step with the left foot, but we can see again the non-kicking foot well behind the line of the ball. So we want that toe to be level with the front of the ball, create this number 10 shape between the non-kicking foot and the ball, and really step alongside the ball to be able to generate maximum amount of control, power, get our body moving in unison with the strike. So here, obviously with the non-kicking foot being so far behind the ball and away, it's going to affect the quality of the strike and contact with the ball. You know the players contact with the ball, again toe looks like it's pointing down so it's going to impact the contact with the ball if our toes pointing down. It's always naturally going to hit more of the underside of the ball which is going to mean the ball is going to naturally raise up. We can see the player is now making contact with the ball more with a straight leg down from the knee and we're not bending our lower leg inside. Because of where the position of the non-kicking foot is really helps us in terms of the contact point with the ball and the technique so we can get our body more in line with the ball although the player is still slightly leaning back. We want to try and get our chest leaning slightly forward, head over the ball so we can really maximise our body momentum moving through the strike. One thing I say for the player is he consistently is looking at the ball through the technical actions that's going to help him in terms of his contact point with the ball and really giving himself the best possible chance for success. ac yn gyflawni'r gweithgaredd ar gyfer y gweithgaredd, fel y gwelwch chi, mae'r chwaraewr yn gweithio yn seiliedig yn y lle gyda'i phwyto, y lle ar y strwyth, drwy'r rhan o'r sioe.

Players not really approaching the ball and just kind of half stepping into a position to try and strike the ball. So you can see a non-kicking foot pointing really wide to the right of the goal, well behind the line of the ball. So we want our non-kicking foot to be positioned alongside the ball with our toe level with the front of the ball and stepping into the shot to allow for the back through and the follow-through action and to strike through the line of the shot. So you can see the player is going to be well behind the line of ball as he's attempting to shoot the ball. Again, the follow-through action, we can see the player is maintaining a relatively locked position with his foot, but there's a limited follow-through coming across his body slightly, so we're not really in full sync between the motion of the technique and the direction and accuracy of the pass. So the player's body is facing the direction he wants the ball to go, the non-kicking foot is pointing that way, the follow-through is coming across his body, so the player in terms of using his body momentum and balancing him through the shot is limited and more related to the contact point between the ball and the right foot striking the ball. Again, there's no real preparation for the ball. Player kind of hops over to his left to get his foot in a position prior to striking the ball with the right. We can see the non-kicking foot again well behind the line of the ball. Toe is not really helping control the direction of the body or the ball. The distance between the ball and the foot is really close. So that's going to limit the player's ability to choose the correct surface or get any form of momentum striking through the ball. We can see there's a slight back lift with the player as he prepares for the ball. But depending on the surface selection of the foot he's looking to use, it's going to be limited based on the position of the ball with a non-kicking foot. Once again, we can see the upper body is not really being utilised for any element of control or power. So we're not opening up our hips, opening up our body to get this back lift higher and to strike through the ball with a follow through. Point of contact, again, we can see a result of the feet being very close together and the ball being in front of the non-kicking foot. It's going to impact the striking leg. You can see the toe position pointing down. Lower leg is turning inside, so that's going to impact what part of the ball we can genuinely make contact with. So it's going to be the lower half of the ball, maybe towards the right of the ball or hitting the ball closer to the heel. We're also seeing that the player, because the ball is in front of the standing foot, the contact with the ball is going to be as the striking leg is on its way up and through. So we lose elements of the follow through in terms of control and power. We also have our body now leaning back, which is going to lead to the ball either going further up because we're reaching for the ball, and we lose that element of body momentum moving through the strike. player striking the ball with the right foot so there is a slight preparation step here so taking a half step towards the ball still quite square behind the ball want to try and come at the ball at an angle want the non-kicking foot to be alongside the ball with the toe level with the front of the ball 3 quarters to a full balls width between the non-kicking foot and the ball so the non-kicking foot here is in a better position than some of the prior actions but again the player is not really stepping into the pass stroke shot to generate any real momentum with his body control, you can see his body is very upright there is no motion to step into the strike to follow through the shot Yn y ddifrif yma, mae'r chwaraewr yn gadael mewn leoedd gwych gyda'i ffyrdd. Mae'n dilyn ymlaen gyda chweithredaeth cyflawniol yn y dyfodol y bydd y ball eisiau mynd. Ond eto, oherwydd y bydd y ball yn ymwneud \u00e2'r ddifrif ychydig, nid yw'r chwaraewr yn defnyddio'r ymdrechion arall neu'r pwerau, yn sefydliad cyflym ac yn ymddangos yn fawr ar ei leoedd gwael a chysylltu ag y ball i gynhwys y pwerau a'r cyd-destun. see a very little follow through the positive is as the player steps into the strike with the left foot or the pass with the left foot he does land on his left foot which gets the body moving forward in the line of the shot although we obviously want that follow through to help generate additional power as well as control so now the control of the ball is really just focused on the contact point between the ball the angle of the foot and the part of the ball we're making contact with rather than utilizing the body so we can obviously see here the hips the chest pointing to the left non-kicking foot is moving forward pointing forwards the striking leg is still angled out to the left as he lands so the the unison of the action is not consistent And looking at contact again, so again, toe pointing down towards the ground. We want the toe more to be pointing up so we can strike more through the middle of the ball. The toe pointing down is naturally gonna make contact with the lower half of the ball or generate more contact with the heel, which is gonna be a different surface of the foot. So it's gonna really impact our quality of strike. Again, we can see on contact, the player obviously is reaching in front because of where the non-kicking foot was planted. So we're already on a kind of upwards follow-through motion as we strike the ball, which now leads to the player's body naturally leaning further back where we want our chest and our head to be in a more forwards leaning position so we can get our full body momentum moving through the ball. Now looking at the contact point with the ball, again the non-kicking foot has a huge impact on the other actions. So we can see the heel up, toe down, that's going to mean we're hitting the ball in a different place to where we'd like the ball, maybe through the middle of the ball to generate the maximum control and power. You can see the angle of the foot is hitting the right side of the ball, which is going to affect the direction of the shot and we can see because again we step behind the line of the ball, player is now reaching so he's actually making contact with the ball on part of the follow through action and his body is leaning back and away from where he wants to go, which is forwards, so we're going to have elements of control and power missing because our body is not going to be moving through the line of the shot. Player switching to his left foot which looks like his weaker foot. So again, very no real genuine approach to the ball, just kind of a half step with the right foot. And again, we can see where the non-kicking foot is in relation to the ball. We want this non-kicking foot to be alongside the ball, toe level with the front of the ball, create this number 10 shape between the non-kicking foot and where the position of the ball is. This allows us now to step into the shot, into the pass, get our body and our strike moving in relation to the ball. Here we're going to end up reaching forwards in front of our body which is going to affect the quality and control of the shot. So again, player, there's no real approach to the ball. So it's a static ball and kind of a, an inch or two to shuffle towards the ball. So we want the foot, the non-kicking foot to be alongside the ball, toe level with the front of the ball, you can see the foot is well far back behind the line of the ball, which is going to affect the player's backswing, follow through, contact point with the ball, and the general control and accuracy of the shot. Once again, there's no real approach for the player, just kind of from a standing position. So you can see on contact, the position of the non-kicking foot well behind the line of the ball. The distance between the non-kicking foot and the ball is extended, so that's gonna affect the follow-through action. So we want the non-kicking foot to step into the pass stroke shot, get our toe level with the front of the ball, create this number 10 shape between the non-kicking foot and the ball. So then that helps us with the other parts of the action for the pass stroke shot. A very short approach again for the player, just kind of a half step, coming very square. I always encourage players when striking the ball to try and come at the ball on an angle which will open up the hips, open up the options for the player. You see the non-kicking foot again, we want it to be placed alongside the ball, toe level with the front of the ball as much as we can. The distance here from the ball is okay, but again, far behind the ball, so we're going to end up reaching for it. We want that toe to be pointing in the general direction we want the ball to go. It just helps with our body momentum coming through the ball, the hip placement, body placement and the follow-through action resulting in the end. We can also see the player, because he's not approaching the ball or stepping into the ball, can't really utilise his upper body for additional balance, momentum and ability to open up his chest, his hips and bring the right leg back with a genuine back lift to come and strike through the line of the shot. On the point of contact you can see heel is up, toe is down so that's going to affect the contact point with the ball and we can also see the player obviously reaching in front of the line of the body so the non-kicking foot well behind the line of ball so now we're making contact with the ball as we are on an upwards angle with the right leg and it's also affecting between the distance the ability for the player to really open up his hips and get his knee out and then this toe in an upwards position to strike through the line of ball we can also see because of the non-kicking foot behind the line of the ball and the player reaching this now leads to the body leaning back and away from the intended direction of the shot You see here the player keeps his foot in a relatively locked position, comes immediately through the line of the ball which is where the control and the power of this particular pass comes from. But again we can see the body leaning back and away in the opposite direction to the direction the ball is going to go. We want to make sure that we're utilising our body as much as we can, stepping forward and being at least in line with the standing foot, if not moving forward so we can land on that right foot and keep moving in the direction the ball is going.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The climber is trying to do this hand foot match. It's definitely a hard method because of the nature of this hold. It kind of comes up like this and then flattens out at the top and there isn't a ton of room actually to hand heel. Ideally the climber would be able to bump their right hand down but this is gonna put a lot more force in this left hand so the hand heel is a bit of a dead end. So the climber decides to go up right hand to this pinch. You can see them on it here in this right frame. They're trying to kind of gun for it, which you really do need to do this move delicately. I think switching the feet here would help control this twist out that the climber is going to experience when grabbing this hold. I also think a little bit more thumb action underneath the hold, pinch it like a brick, similar to this left hand would be ideal as well.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And the climber is in this position. This is sort of a one, two footwork, or a foot jump. It's a jump, but the feet are very integral. So first they're gonna drive through this left foot and get the hips to say about here. And in a perfect world, they would then transfer that weight from the right foot and push really hard through there and get the hips to about here. It's pretty common in climbing where you wanna utilize one foot to generate power and then mid move, transfer that weight to the other. You can get really, really high on the wall this way. And so here you can see the climber has left the right hand and the left hand is still in I think the best way to go about this boulder would just to be to leave both hands at the same time Also staying over the right foot for a little bit longer in order to get more power out of it would be good as well and Climbers really wanting to go one hand into this jug here", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

It's going to come up and over it. And as it does, it causes his foot to reposition and just completely cut down and away, causing him to cut free. So in the future, probably just, you know, you want to see just how you would grab the handhold and think about how you're going to move off of them, how you place the feet and the sequence and how long you can use the foot is going to be dependent on the angle. And if it's going to mess you up later by slipping off and not, you know, it's going to affect how, what, what movement you can do, what position you can be in. So he kind of pulls on and steps his left foot on. It looks like his right foot is placed nicely. But then when he kind of goes to put his left foot back up high on this hold, it doesn't really appear that he looks at where he's placing it. So when he places it, it looks like he may have placed it a little bit wrong or not in line with how he's going to move up the wall. And you can see it just slips completely away. He is, I would say, I'll give him props because he is loading it up quite nicely. And so there is a lot of tension there. It's just in the wrong spot. As we see, he's staring straight up as he places his left foot back on the wall. It looks like he kind of places it not where it needs to be.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So, here he has stirred the milk a couple of different times. There's a few reasons why that is a good practice. One, you're making sure that the milk solids do not burn on the bottom and that the heat is evenly distributing through the milk so you don't have burnt milk. So what I see first off in this video that this cook has probably made this dish before. I do love his organization because he's just reaching back knowing where everything is and that definitely speeds up the process of making a dish. We call it mise en place, knowing where all your ingredients or putting all your ingredients in their proper position. As you can see here, he is pouring the milk in a slow steady stream as to not make a mess and he has that strainer to remove any tea solids out of the milk tea so you're not swallowing that and drinking that and ruining your tea. He also watched the flame. This is also why I can tell that this cook has some experience doing this, is because he was also watching the flame and turning the flame down so that the milk does not boil over. That is a very good thing that the cook just did right there. Instead of setting the spoon on the counter, which could be full of contaminants, he used the same milk container that he poured the milk into the pot with to keep the spoon from off the counter.

They're not using a lot of bow, and they're also playing at the tip. So if they could try to use more bow, just to make sure that they can hear the notes evenly, and then they can adjust the intonation from there. The clarity in this chord could be much improved. If they were to take away their elbow away from their side, they were able to get more of their curved fingers into the string. Additionally, they should be using more bow to make sure that they can get a clearer sound. Again, the bow speaker is very slow and not helping them able to hear the pitch. They should try to keep the bow faster and more steady so that they're creating a better sound and overall they can hear their pitch better. The pulosas are being really tentative with their bow usage, I think because of the intonation is tricky with the chords. No matter what they're doing, they should try to make sure that they're always using a healthy amount of bow so that they're getting the best sound possible. If you will, just make some mistake. It'd be good for them just to practice their skills more consistently so that they don't make any mistakes. The violist has a tendency to keep their fingers high off the fingerboard. They should try to keep them as close as possible, and if playing a higher finger, any of the lower fingers should stay on the string. Again, this is an example where they're using a small amount of bow. Their sound isn't projecting as much as it could. If they were to use just a little bit more extra speed, they'd get a better sound and could hear their pitch even better. This double stop could be more balanced. You could play the lower string a little bit more and also use more bow. Since they're playing two strings, there's more friction, so they need a little bit more to make sure that they're speaking clearly. The BUS plays a chord, where they're playing two strings at once. When playing out at the tip of the bow, their sound is really thin. They can try to pronate more in their right hand to make sure that their weight is able to get through the bow to the tip of the bow. The vios is playing a scale. This is another example where the sound sounds very thin, so when trying to hear and analyze the chord, it's not as clear. If they used more bow and a little bit more weight distributed evenly between the chord of the two strings, that would help a lot. Intonation can be improved on this chord if they're able to bring their hand a little bit further around. You can see in this finger here that it's collapsed because they're trying to make the hand shape. If they can bring their elbow a little bit more away from their body, they can get further around the fingerboard to have a more curved hand shape. Then here's an example of their fingers coming really high off the fingerboard. The more that they're playing, I believe this is why they're making any mistakes, they can be more efficient by keeping them closer to the fingerboard. Again, this is another example that as they're getting higher up the string, they should move their bow closer to the bridge so that they still get a very clear sound and then they can hear the pitch better.

Pianist is playing this slightly faster, this descending arpeggio, than they are able to execute it perfectly. So they just need to play it a little bit slower, practice it a little bit slower. We use just a little bit more clarity on these notes, even though the pedal is down So just a little bit snappier of a of a finger movement when playing these especially because the pedals down We need to do anything we can to get the clarity In these thirds on this chord, we need to hear a little bit more of the lower voices to match the volume of the higher voice, which is just as simple as putting a little bit more weight, pressing down on the key slightly harder on fingers 1 and 2.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Again, it would be helpful for them to consider an approach where they play more with the tip of their finger and then they can get a little bit more coordination with their hands. In this piece, the pianist could get a little bit more brightness and brilliance in their sound if they used more of their fingertips and more speed into the key and then quickly out of it. The pianist is starting to rush here just really slightly. Some of the notes start to feel a bit compressed with their rhythms. It'd be best for them just to make sure that they can practice this with a metronome and also practice slower so they really feel like their hands are even when they're playing. Pianist uses their forearm to help guide them to find this note down the keyboard. The pianist is playing with flat fingers, and if they could play with more curved fingers, they would have more ease of playing the notes and ease of getting around the keyboard. The pianist is doing a good job of transferring their weight from this note to this note using their arm to go back and forth. The pianist still has a tendency to rush forward a bit. I have a feeling it's because of the left hand, the notes that they're playing is really short. They could just have a little bit more length on each of them, which will help ground them into the tempo. This is another section where it starts to feel like it's rushing a bit. The pianist has more time than they think when transferring their arm from one place to another and that will help dictate the tempo. They should make sure that they're practicing slowly and have a sense that they have more time than they think they do. As the pianist is playing with their left hand, they can try to experiment with longer notes in the bass line to help shape the phrase. Currently all of the notes are the same articulation, resulting in it sounding a little bit monotonous.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This is an interesting choice. I would think that she would be putting oil into the pan as it's preheating instead of into the egg mixture. Here she is drizzling about a tablespoon of oil across the surface of the omelette pan. This is to ensure that the egg does not stick when it's added to the pan. She could also use butter or pan spray. Additionally, her flame has gone out on this particular eye and she struggles to get it re-lit, ultimately choosing to light the eye on the left-hand side. However, I would like to see her discard this eggshell immediately. Obviously, we mentioned her small workspace, but eggshells carry a lot of bacteria and dirt on them and you do want to immediately throw those away. After adding the red onions to her mixing bowl by hand, she slices her green pepper into very thin slices. or sorry this is ground turmeric the first was probably paprika or some other kind of ground red pepper. The tools that she will need are a small mixing bowl and the flat spatula, which you can see that she has gathered here. I do like that she is putting away her cutting board and her knife as she no longer needs them. Obviously I mentioned before, but she has a very limited workspace and this opens her up for better organization and better use of a small space. She removes the peel and cuts it in half and then slices each half crosswise and then turns those slices a quarter turn and cuts those into those slices into slices to create a fine dice. At this point, her omelet is most likely cooked. An omelet needs to cook about a minute and a half to two minutes on the first side and about 30 seconds on the second side. She does successfully turn the omelet after about a minute and a half of cooking, but she is obviously timid and fearful that it is going to tear. Using her flat metal spatula, she can go around the outsides of the omelet to ensure that they're not sticking. First, she cuts off both ends of the red onion with the onion in her left hand and using her right hand with the paring knife. I would never recommend cutting into your own hand, especially when you have a cutting board sitting right beneath you. I would always recommend cutting the onion in half lengthwise on the cutting surface to easily peel it. As she adds the omelet to the pan, it doesn't actually pour out into a perfect, you know, layer of circle. So she is attempting to use the back of the spoon to spread out the omelet so that it is in an even layer, so it cooks evenly. The first step in cooking an omelet is gathering all of the ingredients and the tools that you will need to complete the task. Here you can see that she has this omelet pan that she has put over medium heat. Here you can see that she is attempting to combine her eggs, vegetables, and seasoning all together in this small bowl with a spoon. I would recommend her using either a fork or a wire whisk in this scenario to incorporate more air into the mixture prior to adding it to the pan. Using the side of a spoon, she cracks her egg shell in half and then using both of her thumbs, she opens it directly into the mixing bowl. This is an appropriate way to open the egg without any eggs spilling onto your countertop. She could also tap it lightly on the edge of the bowl to crack it or, like I mentioned, on the edge of the countertop. Now she has a plastic cutting board in front of her and a paring knife. She is setting up her workspace. As you can see, this is a very limited or a small kitchen, so there's very limited workspace. And she's doing the best that she can, but she could keep a more organized kitchen to allow for more space to work. She drizzles a little bit more oil around the edge of the omelet. I'm not exactly sure why at this point this is the third time she's adding oil but I believe that she is fearful that the omelet is sticking. She's doing these steps a little in reverse. So she is seasoning the bowl, the mixing bowl, before anything is in it. This is about a half of a teaspoon of ground turmeric I believe. And the last step before serving is transferring your omelet from the pan to the serving tray here. And from the fridge, she gathers one egg, a small red onion, and a green pepper.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So we can see on our left hand screen here, right foot is about to pull the ball towards the left foot. And it's an inside to inside shuffle with one step in between. This will usually be used if we're being challenged by a player aggressively. So if they're coming towards the ball to win it here, or even if it's a 50-50 where we get to the ball slightly before the other player, it can again take the ball out of the path of the danger, which is coming again in this direction, and just move it across and forward to go around the danger. So a good 1v1 skill to use, a good ball retaining or a ball winning skill to use also if it's a loose ball. Here we're seeing a good scale if we look to the left hand side screen. The ball is going to move from left to right, back from right to left. This scale here is called a cow tail or a flick flack. It is basically a whip in motion. Right here we're seeing good technique because we have a knee here is outside the ball and what this allows us to do is when the ball is moved out here, the leg is extended from initial touch on the inside of the ball, we now must move our foot to the outside of the ball to push it back in this direction here. So it's a it's kind of a sign for this player that they have a good level of skill and they have a good level of experience because this is not an easy move but when you break the mechanics down it can be pulled off pretty effectively so we can see that this player is pretty experienced and skillful on the ball. So far, it's pretty much freestyling in terms of dribbling. There's not many repetitive sequences going on here that are super challenging and that are being pulled off super fast. It's pretty much kind of freestyling, going with the flow, pulling it back, moving it forward, turning with it. Again, no real sequence or challenge, just trying to move the ball, still seeing a good tempo of movement here with the ball and a nice high amount of touches per second, which again is high skill in itself, but I'm hoping to see some repetitive sequences here that we can kind of judge a little bit more on. So again, still seeing some good ball mastery. Some good manoeuvres with the ball. However, still quite casual in the stance and in the distance being covered. The person, the player is not covering a lot of distance in a short period of time. It's still quite high up in the stance on the turns, not getting down low with sharp cuts, just a lot of sole rolls, insides. So again, while this is good quality ball mastery, it is not quite up there at the very highest of the high end on the proficiency scale. So with there being no repetitive sequences in here yet I'm looking for some efficiency and where I can find some efficiency efficiency shown is In some of the combinations such as the sole roll to the inside of the foot There's a connected step and pattern within those ones and we're seeing them quite often So again, this is a showing me that the player is higher up on the proficiency scale However still want to see a little bit more if we're to push it a bit higher So we're still seeing a decent amount of touches per second here in more of a freestyling manner. I would still like to see some repetitive sequences being pushed here, so we could really see some speed and really get more of an understanding of proficiency here. But you know some of the criteria we are judging here upon being touches per second, tempo and so on, it's coming up at the higher end. But again I'd still like to see more speed in terms of the player moving and covering distance and also some repetitive sequences where we can look at efficiency, steps between touches and touch weight etc. Okay, so here we have a dribbling video. In this video I will be rating my proficiency based on some of the following factors. Fluidity of the movement, the surfaces of the foot that are being used while dribbling, is there a variety, is there not? The technique within the dribble, the stance and the centre of the gravity of the player when they're dribbling and turning, the ball speed and the tempo of the touches on the ball while the ball is in motion, repetitive and challenging sequences, are there any being put in there? The long length of repetitive sequences with speed increasing or at least being consistently high throughout and then also the amount of steps between the touches, are we trying to move the ball fast or are we taking light touches with a bunch of steps in between? So I will base my proficiency on some of these and I will also highlight some of these within the video. Another good combination I want to highlight here is an inside of the foot touch that moved into a sole roll to set up a scissors and then followed up by an outside hook. So four different moves combined very fluidly and efficiently which are pushing the proficiency of this one up. So last few combinations have been a lot of sole rolls to the inside of the opposite foot with a bit of a turn As we can see here quite a high stance Straight up. Look at the right hand side screen shoulders are high and Looking down You know, I think there's definitely room for more speed in this one And the stance also could be lowered to allow for faster movements sharper turning and and just a better protective stance of the ball and What we're seeing is kind of a casual speed with a casual stance not quite pushing The tempo as high as possible in this one Okay, so early on in this video we're seeing some good fluidity with high amount of touches per second. Some variety in there with the surfaces of the feet that are being used, lots of different surfaces being used here and being combined from bottom of the foot to inside and so on. It's very strong, more so on the ball mastery side so far where the ball is being moved but not quite top speed dribbling just yet. So a couple of things to note on the proficiency there.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Again, it's behind the line of the ball, so that continues to be an error for him. Number two here is that that toe is lower than the heel, because you can see the foot angle is like this in the picture. So what he's presenting then is more heel, actually, or a surface that's closer to his heel, which as he strikes, it could then force the ball to go wide or more this direction. And not really have a lot of power as well. So the correction there would be, get that plant foot next to the ball, get that toe up, heel down, get that body leaning over the ball, head down over the ball as much as possible, and then just overemphasize following through towards the target. Yeah, one thing I want to point out here is just that support foot, that plant foot is more pointed in this direction and then the target of where he's actually kicking is this way. So it's a little bit inefficient there. It can still be done, obviously, with the way in which he's kicking it. That's no problem. But he has to overcorrect with how he's following through the angle of this hip here. So that is something that he could actually just fix that by making this support foot point towards this way and using that as a target. The second thing here is because he's having to reach out and sort of extend for the ball in front of his support foot, in front of his body as he kicks it, you can see that that front toe is slightly pointed down and that heel is slightly higher than that one. It would be probably wiser or better for him if that heel was a little bit lower than the toe and it was maybe more like this. And then combine that with that foot facing this direction and getting that support foot closer to the ball or next to the ball and not leaning back as he hits the ball. It would be better if he was over the ball, head down over the ball, fully focused on the ball, and that would be helpful for this kick. Yeah, one thing just because he doesn't have like a big step into the ball and then a strike He's and he's trying to hit the ball very softly back towards this way more than likely because he doesn't want to hurt this player That's standing in the goal So there's very little power being generated because there's no back lift with the leg and then coming and kicking through So it's very minimal and not with a lot of speed in the knee action of what he bends it and then comes forward so that's number one there too is the The follow-through is a very short and shallow follow-through and again, this is because he's kicking from five yards away potentially So he doesn't need to generate a lot of power on this kick He's also not really really consistent with where he's choosing to hit the ball So what would be good for him actually is if he just had the same Repetition of shooting too low in this corner over and over again Let's say for an X number of reps or five number of reps I think it would help him train a technique more repetitively And this is one thing I do like that he's done pretty consistently here is that as the ball is rolling this direction He's stepping forward to come meet the ball and I like that a lot actually He's not just waiting for the ball to arrive and then initiate a kicking action And you can see that he's tracking the ball with his eyes his heads down tracking that there as he takes that step So I like that I think for this skill. I think that's good So one thing just to say here that this video is labeled as a penalty kick. I'm assuming this player is acting as a goalkeeper, but the player that's kicking or working, this subject is actually hitting a rolling ball that's being kind of bowled back towards him and then he's kicking the ball either away from this goalkeeper or the player on the goal or he's kicking directly back at him and he'll repeat this process by bowling the ball back out. So number one is that it's not replicating an actual penalty kick. This is more like a partner passing and receiving exercise. A penalty kick would be that the ball is placed in a stationary position every single repetition and the kicking player runs up and kicks the ball against a direct opponent with the aim or intention of trying to put the ball into the goal. Yeah, again, just looking at the contact point of the ball, he's having to lean back every single time because of where he's contacting this ball. Very far in front of his body. Very clearly that you can see that there. And the intention of this foot going this direction, and then his contact is trying to force the ball to go that direction. So all that combined, actually, it just doesn't allow him to generate a lot of force if he was trying to hit this with any power. Again, just going to be that he gets the plant foot next to the ball, align his hips more appropriately with his target, and then inside of the foot here, really trying to hit the center of the foot at a lower contact point or a mid-ball contact point. I think all those things combined would start to help these be better looking ball strikes. Yeah, I mean, really consistent theme for him is there's this constant like slight lean back in his upper body, which is away from the ball. And that support foot is consistently kind of going like this direction here. So if he could fix that, I would say get that support foot next to the ball more pointed towards his intended target. That could be one criteria or one thing that he could improve. The second thing is that would naturally then allow that upper body to be a little bit more over the ball. We want to keep correcting that so that he has better balance and less of a chance of contacting the ball out in front of his body, which is what he's tending to do here. And that increases the risk of that ball rising up into the air unless he just under hits it. So something to consider how we can control the trajectory of the ball a little bit better. Yeah, so just looking at the technique then of hitting like a rolling ball that's moving back towards him. You can see here that the contact point of the ball is slightly in front of his body and the plant foot is a little bit behind the ball as he's making contact. You can see that ball just leaving his foot at this point in the picture. As much as he can, like if he wants to keep the ball on the ground, the recommendation would be to try to get that plant foot a little bit more next to the ball as he initiates his kicking sequence. If he's contacting the ball out in front of his body, you can see that's why he has like this upper body lean sort of in that direction. So the only way to keep it low then would be one to control his power, like how hard he kicks the ball back and return. And then the other point would be like he's kicking the ball more at the midline or midpoint of the ball, which will help kind of go like smooth to keep the ball lower to the ground versus if he hit the ball very low, low towards the ground below that center line, then that would force the ball to pop up into the air.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As we look on the right frame on our offensive player's finish, in his left-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice that the player does really well at controlling his body and not allowing his momentum to take him away from the basket, but instead allowing his momentum to carry him towards the basket, giving the ball a better opportunity of having the accuracy and power it needs to hit our targeted area on the backboard and creating a proper angle of dropping through the net, resulting in a completed layup attempt. As we look at the player go into his left-handed reverse layup attempt on his release, on the right frame we can notice that the player does really well at jumping at his maximum effort, having his momentum go towards the rim, allowing the ball to create the right amount of force it needs to be able to hit our targeted area and to have the proper angle and touch it needs to drop through the net, resulting in the completed layup. As we focus our attention on the left frame, we can notice that the player does really well in his follow-through release hand, having it turned left, directed towards our targeted area, which is the rim, also allowing the ball to create the proper rotation and spin it needs to be able to hit our targeted area, which is the top left corner on the backboard, creating a proper angle to be able to drop through the net, resulting in a completed layup attempt. A slight adjustment we can make to help the offensive player create more security and protection on the ball is to bring his ball placement position closer towards his chest and body and also a little bit higher towards his shoulder area. This will allow more security and protection, preventing defenses to be able to have easy access of stripping, taking, or stealing the ball. As we look at the left frame, we can notice again that the player does really well at his follow-through, having his hand rotated towards the left, which creates the right amount of spin and rotation the ball needs to be able to be directed towards our targeted area, which is the left top corner of the box on the backboard, allowing the ball to create the proper angle it needs to drop through the net. As we look at the player go into his gather attempt for his left-handed reverse layup, again, as we look on the right frame, the player does really well at locating and locking his eyes on his target. Also, we will want the player to create more security and protection on the ball and to not have it exposed out to allow defenders to be able to have easy access of stripping the ball causing an offensive turnover for the player. So we will want the ball placement to be closer towards his chest area and a little bit higher towards his shoulders. As we shift our attention to the left frame, we can notice that the player again does really well in his follow through rotating hand, pointing his five fingers towards our targeted area, which allows the ball to create the proper spin and rotation it needs to be able to, as you see, hit our targeted area, the top left corner of the box on the backboard. And this will allow the ball to create a proper angle to be able to drop through the net, resulting in a successful layup attempt. As we look at the player go into his left-handed reverse layup attempt on the right frame, we can notice that the player does really well at locating his target with his eyes to create a much easier finish. As we look at the right frame, again to create more security and protection on the ball and from defenders, we will want the offensive player to bring his ball placement position closer towards his body and higher towards his shoulder area to prevent defenders from having easy access of stripping, taking, or stealing the ball in a game-like scenario. As we look at the offensive player release on the right frame into his left-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice that the player does really well at jumping towards the basket, allowing the ball and creating the ball enough power and accuracy it needs to be able to hit our targeted area, creating a proper angle to drop through the net. Bringing the ball closer to the offensive player's body will also put pressure on referees to overlook defenders coming across the body to try to steal, take, or strip the ball, resulting in a foul call and two free throws at the line. Another detail that the player does really well into his left-handed reverse layup attempt. On the right frame, we can notice that the player has the correct footwork by stepping with his left foot first and jumping off his right jumping leg.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

But it seems like it kind of costs him some energy on these two pinches when he could have just kind of maybe backflip or kind of just use his right foot to kind of almost pogo and kind of swing out to carry his momentum up as he jumps. Then here he kind of commits the wrong sequence. So he's got this big hold here and he actually goes up, tries to match his hand up above and then drops his hand below as he attempts to kind of use this one to kind of pull to the left. So this distance is gonna be a lot bigger. Whereas if he kind of stayed both hands matched here, went right hand here, bring his left hand up to here would be a lot simpler. So he kind of just commits to the wrong sequence that makes the move a lot bigger and a lot harder than it needs to be.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I would encourage this dancer to really think about attack of the steps and really have energy while they're dancing and really think about, again, attacking the steps or putting a lot of effort into doing each movement so their body can kind of make decisions and not second guess themselves. When you attack or you have precision when you're dancing, it forces the mind and the body to connect and therefore make some decisions about where you would like to go next. Which again, performing this basic choreography, it at least shows us what the basic choreography is supposed to be, right? I would encourage the dancer to really study the rhythm because they're off the music and off the beat. So really taking the time to listen to the music and digest the music and learn the rhythms and then applying that to the body is very important. I would encourage the dancer to use their arms as an anchor and to kind of help them with direction. So if they're going forward, move their arm forward. If they're going back, swing their arms back and kind of use it to help them stay on the rhythm and power through the movement, using their arms as an anchor and having strength and power behind those arms. Here, I would encourage the dancer to really snap that foot back. So tap on the ball of the foot and quickly snap that foot back. Same thing, tap, snap, tap, snap, right? When I say snap, I mean like bring that foot back to the center of their body and then back out, right? So they're quickly tapping and bringing it back in. It's quickly tapping and bringing it back in. And of course, I would encourage them to be more grounded so they can do this quickly and more efficiently because they have a greater range of motion. This would improve the overall performance quality of this basic choreography. To improve this step, I would encourage the dancer to first plie or bend their legs and to open their legs a little bit So they kind of have this wide squatting position And grounded position to have more agility to be able to move in all directions Quickly with the music", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And this is also a great example of a plie or bending the leg. I would just again encourage them to have more power and strength through the arm. The dancer does a really great job of having musicality. However, there are instances where they seem like there may be a half a second off. So over anticipating the music is a good skill for this dancer in order to really stay on the rhythm throughout the entire dance. I would encourage the dancer at this moment to have a little bit more hustle or to again over anticipate the movement so it looks energetic and it's exciting to watch which is always important in dance. Just want to highlight, this is the first time I've actually seen this, the circular, the use of the arms while they're doing this body roll. And I really appreciate that in this moment. And I also appreciate the foot articulation, the bend of the legs, the torso and the hip engagement as well. I would encourage this dancer for the step, step, slide, step, step, slide to take bigger steps and bigger slides in order to accentuate the movement and the dynamic quality within this basic salsa. I think if the dancer was to take bigger steps and even elongate this plie when they're doing this circular motion or pattern on the floor, they would be able to carve through space and take up more space, which would create an even better, more dramatic, dynamic quality in this movement. This dancer does a really good job at this skill of spotting, which I talk about a lot, where you look at one point and then you whip your head around and then the rest of your body follows in this to be able to turn faster without getting dizzy. This dancer does a really great job of spotting. So just wanted to show a positive example of that. I would encourage this dancer to use their back and let their arm flow from their back to elongate all the way out through their fingertips as they reach side to side and continue to plie or bend through their legs in order to have more strength and power behind the movement.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So again, it does a good job of getting good height as the ball hits the top of the square, but since it's inside of the square, we don't want to use any side spin at all. Little to no side spin. Most likely inside the square we don't want any side spin at all, especially from this position. But since a little bit of side spin was used and the ball made contact on the backboard inside of the square, it spinned off the backboard and then it just hit the inside of the right portion of the rim and the side spin on it rolled around and around and ended up coming out and we turned a layup into an in and out miss layup. So when you see balls roll around the rim and then it misses out, the phrase you hear most commonly for that is in and out. The shot looked like it was going in, but for some reason or another it ended up scooping out and we missed the shot. The reason in this particular case is because of the side spin on the ball when the ball made contact on the backboard inside of the square. The player places the ball on the backboard slightly outside of the square, but it has good height as it's near the top level of the square. So from this position here, in order for us to make the shot, we need to make sure we have good side spin, which the player does, and the ball spins off of the backboard and into the basket. So this was a good use of side spin. After we make the layup on the mic and drill, and we catch the ball out of the net, we do not want the ball to drop down below our waist. When we catch the ball out of the net, we want to keep the ball high around our upper chest shoulder area. Two hands on the ball, keep it high, be strong, and then we take, we use the proper footwork to relocate to the opposite side of the basket and we shoot the layup on the opposite side of the floor. In this case, the player allowed the ball to drop down too low. The ball makes contact with the backboard slightly outside of the square but it also has really good height as it's above the level of the top of the square. Since it's outside of the square we need a good amount of side spin on the ball in order for it to spin off of the backboard and go into the basket. This is another example of good use of side spin this time on the left side of the basket with our left hand to get the ball to spin off of the backboard and into the basket when the ball makes contact with the backboard outside of the square. As the player is catching the ball out of the net, he already has his foot planted, his right foot planted, and it doesn't move until he shoots the ball again. And as he steps, he's bringing his left foot and putting it down here next to his right foot and then jumping up to shoot. As the ball is coming out of the net, his right foot shouldn't be in this spot. You want to, as the ball is coming down, we're stepping with this left foot to the position where this right foot is. And as we catch the ball, if we're jumping off of one foot, if we're doing a one-foot mic and drill, we'll just jump off the left foot when we put it down here in this position and jump up and shoot the ball with our right hand. If we're doing a two-foot mic and drill, which this player is doing right now, when we step with that left foot here, that right foot, which will be back over here in this area if we're doing the drill with the correct footwork, as we catch the ball and that left foot goes down, the right foot will swing around to square ourselves up and then we go up for the shot. So this is an example of the need for us to use the proper footwork.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They put in a really good effort, but I think they can overall have more attack, more groundedness, and really think about being precise in their movement to help their overall proficiency in this intermediate salsa. Sometimes it seems like they get a little bit caught up and that their torso is moving faster than their hips. And the way to have more range of motion and move quickly, of course, is to engage that core and make sure that they're grounded, bending those knees. I would encourage the dancer to really dig in and find the rhythm. Sometimes they're a little bit off of the music and catching up to the musicality. Even when they haven't officially started the movement yet, this really understanding of the rhythm will set you up for failure or success. So really taking the time to study this movement is super important. Overall, I think the dancer needs more attack, right? And making sure that they're moving really quickly and efficiently, and really drilling moving fast. And thinking about, in order to drill moving fast, one way to do that is to think about the transitions and how you get from one step to the next step.

However, they're still having trouble with their heel toe surface where their toe is pointed down and their heel up, which makes the foot slightly less accurate and gives the ball less of a surface to hit off of. One thing they are doing well though is maintaining a locked ankle position, which allows the ball to be redirected somewhat sharply or with accuracy rather than if you have a limp ankle, the ball will tend to skid off in all different directions. The last few sequences show a better heel-toe relationship with his right foot, but a relatively poor one with his left foot. And the last three, you've been able to see that he tends to leave his non-dominant foot with the toe down and the heel up, which makes those passes inaccurate. Whereas his right foot tends to have a better heel-toe relationship and more of a lock, which makes them more accurate. It's an excellent visual in order to see how you can create a better heel-toe relationship, which will lead to more accuracy. Here is a good example of one of the continued mistakes, which is the heel toe relationship from, again, wanting the heel down and the toe up to him having his heel up and toe down. It makes it for an inaccurate surface. We're here after it hits his foot in this position, it shanks off slightly to the left because the clean surface was not there and it must have redirected slightly off his toe or bottom of his cleat. Again, to improve this, have the heel down and the toe locked. In this frame, he does a much better job of having that relationship where the heel is pointed slightly down and the toe is pointed up, which allows it to create a much flatter or horizontal surface, which reacts into having a more accurate pass. Again, the key element here is that you want to be able to step into the pass with your heel down and toe up in a locked position, with the ball going directly back from where you receive it. The next part of this setup, besides the athletic position, which includes the lower center of gravity and being on the balls of the feet, which in this frame, the player is doing a better job of, is taking a small half step in towards where the ball is coming from. This allows you to meet the ball with your technique in a proper circumstances with your timing. If you allow the ball to continue to roll into you, usually you will have less power and less accuracy and you tend to let the ball bounce or move too closely to you before you step. The big thing here is, as the ball arrives, take a small step towards the ball, which allows you to adjust your technique and redirect the ball in the direction you want. The first part of receiving and returning a pass with one touch is how you set up your body position. Here, the player is much too upright. He needs to bend his knees and be more on the balls of both feet so he can react if the ball is to the right or to the left of him. Depending on the direction of the service, he will need to quickly make adjustments in order to return the pass properly. Here, he is too flat-footed. You can see he is on the heels of this foot. You can also see that he is much too upright with no bend in his knee. The third element would be his follow-through. After his pre-touch balancing and body positioning and then the actual strike surface, for the follow-through of a short one-touch pass, you actually don't want it to be too elongated. Rather, you want it to be firm and sharp the way he has it. This makes it so the pass return is weighted properly, rather than if you follow through too hard, the ball will be shot at your partner with too much speed. Again, the short sharp follow-through, again keeping it close to his body, makes it so rather than the ball goes back with a ton of pace, it's simply returned with about the same amount of power you received it in. The next technical element would be the actual strike surface you create for the ball. For an inside of the foot return pass, you want your heel down and your toe up. In this sequence, you can see that he has his heel up and his toe down. This is an extremely inaccurate surface. You want this relationship to be inverse with the heel down and the toe up in a locked position. In the last few sequences, the player has done a better job of maintaining a slightly more athletic stance with bending his knees, staying more balanced, ready to move by not allowing his feet to plant too heavily, and he's doing a better job of stepping into his pass. This allows him to control the pace of the ball and have more accuracy. His setup in the last few sequences has been closer to adequate or proficient, which is allowing his passes to be more accurate. With his pre-touch movement, you can also see where, again, having your feet flat-footed and your center of gravity high makes you very reactive to the ball. Rather than taking small micro-adjustments to get an accurate pass, he again finds himself heavily planted in reaching across with improper technique, which leads to inaccurate passes. Most of this can be prevented by lowering your center of gravity and being on the balls of your feet, which will allow you to react and position yourself better to the ball rather than be reactive and try to fix already improper technique. Although initially the player was using a two-touch sequence where they received, took a touch, and then passed back with the next touch, for the majority of the video, at about 26 seconds in, they revert to just one-touch passing. Something that he's been inconsistent with, but when he tends to do it, his passes are better, is taking that final step towards the ball when he's getting ready to pass, rather than waiting on his heels for the ball to come to him. Whenever he does this, he tends to have more accuracy. Here, he does an excellent job of stepping into his pass, which allows him to set it quickly back to his teammate. In the last few sequences, his heel-toe relationship has improved slightly, but again, his pre-touch movements have gone back to the default, which where he tends to be very flat-footed and very upright with his heels planted heavily in the ground, which one for his pre-touch makes it so this foot should be pointed towards where he wants to pass rather than this direction. But because of he's flat-footed, he tends to not step into the ball and get this body reaction and then also again, lower center of gravity, so rather than being reactive, he can anticipate and move for a better setup before he passes. However, he has improved in his heel-toe relationship, which means his passes have been relatively accurate in the last few sequences. Here, although he's not necessarily in an athletic position because he's still too upright and the knees are bent, both of his feet are on the balls rather than the heels. And you can see he's taking a step in towards the ball where you want to pass or where he wants the pass to go. This will allow him to control his technique and meet the ball on his terms, rather than waiting too long and letting the ball to meet him. So although he's missing some technical elements, here's he's doing a good job of taking a step towards the ball and meeting it, which will allow for a more accurate and firm pass. As previously stated, if you're not in an athletic position, which includes lowering your center of gravity with knee bent and being on the balls of your feet, which allow you to react and move either side, you end up in situations like this, where rather than moving and shifting his body in order to use proper technique, he's reaching across himself off balance to get the ball. Because he was too heavily planted on this foot, his brain automatically lifts his dominant foot and makes him reach off balance to return a pass that will most likely involve poor technique. The player here now is working on a one-touch passing sequence. This involves a partner passing into their feet directly and then returning the pass with either the right or the left foot. One-touch return passing or setting is a common action in soccer that all players need to work on and execute properly in order to play at higher levels.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Since the climber will have to make the move at distance, he sends the left leg onto a flag, meaning flagging out helps the climber to have a civility when making the move as well as transferring over the weight to the right foot being in position. Later on, once the climber has engaged on the flag and uses the toe to push, it will help him with gaining direction when going out right for the reach, as well as supporting the climber to keep his center of gravity close to the area of support, which later on when he goes into the reach, he keeps his right side, which will benefit for his extension going out right against the wall. Because the climber was able to secure the grip with the left hand, the climber was able to relocate his knee drop to be an extended and push down on the toe maintaining the foot placement. And this one he extends it this time to allow transferring the weight over to the highest foot being in place. And as we can see his right hand has come out of the pinch to make the placement to the next hold. The climber being in two solid grips, meaning that the climber is able to wrap the hands on the holes, the left hand being a jug and the right hand being a positive pinch, meaning that has holes on each side where the climber can curl the fingers. He's able to lean back and apply pressure that way only by engaging the fingers and not the arms. This is called the rest position and he is only placement on the wall for his feet as a left foot so he needs to continually make sure that when he leans back he tries to bring his hips close to the wall so he can transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place. At this moment he spends some time looking down for making a placement of the right toe so the grips right now are solid but the climber also needs to make sure he doesn't take so much time because it will tire the climber out eventually since he will need to continue to have endurance to finish the climb. Here the climber has send the right hand up for the next move, this one being a jug. The climber is able to wrap the hand on the edge of the hold, this one being a lip. So the climber curls the fingers behind it and applies pressure by leaning on it, pulling on the hold. The climber now having the arm extended, this tells me that he is not engaging the arm and only the grip and is able to glance down at the foot once securing that grip to release pressure at the feet, especially on the left foot which was the one placed the lowest, now to come into a higher stance. Here the climber is made the right hand up for another pinch hold. In this one the climber before engaging onto that reach he had extended the arms this to be in the rest position which is good of the climber to first examine the wall and not engage the arms and whenever he's ready he then will engage onto a slight pull up to make the move. As we can see the left leg has been extended during this period and this is to make the climber feel stable when on the wall. Also to not have him swing to the left side he places the left foot on it. This leg extended is called back, it's called flagging out which helps the climber to also transfer the weight over the high foot that is the one that is being in position. As the climber engaged on the pull-up to make the move out left, coming into another pinch for the left hand, the climber had kept the right leg extended and had pressed the toe against the wall. This was helping the climber to when he was gain, not only to gain height, but only also to gain direction as he was moving out to the left. The climber is bringing the left hand up for a match, meaning that both hands are in the same hold and being a jug makes it easier for the climber to sustain the hold. Now the climber at this moment is doing a foot switch so he needs to constantly apply pressure down at the feet by bringing the right foot in, placing the toe on the hold and once the climber has contact and pressure then the climber is able to release the left toe out of the hold. The climber has swapped his placement of the left hand on the pinch and instead tries to secure the grip by sending the outer side of the hand to be facing towards the wall. That way the climber is able to have a more of a closed grip which gives it more power to the grip by sending the fingers onto one side and then he's pressing with the bottom ball of the palm on the other side to engage on that pinch. It's important on the placement of where the hand on the pinch will do it so he brings the outer side of the hand towards the wall as far in. Now the climber had made a right foot placement which is necessary as the climber is going to go out for the next hold at a reach. So it's important the climber has secured a foot placement before going up for the next move. The climber has made the reach to a pinch hold. The climber is sending the hand obviously with the fingers being on the outside and the thumb to be above the hold in this instance. So in order for the climber to create pressure he's gonna have to really engage on that thumb to lean weight onto it as he curls the thumb to make a press at the top while the fingers try to go out into a squeeze to the hold. In this case the climber needs to remain with the wrist pointing out right in order to pull the hold and before the climber got to the reach he had to make sure he had a good foot positioning. First he had sent the right foot into a high placement to let her release it when he was trying to gain momentum to make the reach. In this case the right leg potentially is extended to help him transfer the weight over to the left foot which is the one that he needed to rely on to later on also engage on the pull up to the reach. The climber originally had brought his right hand to an open hand pinch that was sloped, so it wasn't a very secure grip and quickly trying to make a foot placement on the left foot, the climber then chooses to bump up to the final hold. This one the climber is able to apply the fingers above and as we can see is flat at the top, so the climber must place the fingers meeting the hold and create friction as well as bending the hand by the knuckles to create force on the pull. The climber must stay underneath the hold in order to sustain the grip. The climber here is starting at a sit start. Sit starts are known to be adding to the grade of difficulty to the climb. This is because the climber will need to bring his weight to the limbs that are positioned onto the wall. Once the climber has raised the hips and is on the wall, then the climb will start. The climber was able to make the placement of the left hand on the next hold Potentially being a pinch as we can see there is a thumb underneath placed and then the fingers are placed above Now in order for the climber to make this reach it was important how he made his body positioning he had sent his right foot to come into a high placement and He has brought then he has used a knee drop on The left leg a knee drop can also function as a flagging if the climber Is not able to take out The foot out of the wall in order to keep his center of gravity close to the wall. So The climber engaged the knee drop by pivoting his foot to Twist in words is slightly to allow the knee drop this can Actually add some strain into the knee so this is only going to be used when on a quick move and The knee drop considered to be used on the same way as flag is only done on overhang walls like this one As we can see the climber is pushing against the hold. This one is a hold that is not on his sequence and it should have been pushed against the wall. This is something that the climber needs to be aware when making foot placements. In this instance, the climber is glancing down at the feet. This is because he needs to make a more accurate foot switch. First, he will need to bring the left toe to come into placement to the foot hold before he releases the right toe out of place. This not only the climber is engaging more force in the grips to release some of the pressure down at the feet, but the climber needs to constantly keep pressure down at the foot so his foot doesn't come out of place and then he'll avoid from going out on a swing. When the climber was making the left hand placement to the final hold, he's coming to a match, and in that moment the right foot had come out of place. In order for the climber to complete the climb, he only needs to hold on to that final hold with both hands for 3 seconds in order to complete the climb. It's important that the climber looks down at the feet. In this instance the climber is doing a foot swap. So the climber must bring himself as close as he can to the wall engaging on a pull up to apply more pressure at the grips. This way the climber is able to bring his right foot in top of the hold and able to release the left foot from placement. In this case the climber is doing a foot hop which means that he is actually engaging more of the grip in this case because the climber is jumping over the hold in order to make the placement. He's able to do this confidently because the hold is big enough for the climber to make the foot placement. As we can see, the climber is starting at a one-hold start, meaning that both of the hands will be placed in the same hold. This is called matching. And the way that the climber is holding onto the grip is called pinch. So the pinch grip works as the climber wraps the hand around the hold with the fingers on top and the thumb at the bottom. The thumb will create pressure on the squeeze. And once the climber is ready to be positioned with the feet on the wall, in this case, the left foot is the one that is at highest placement, the climber then will have to engage into a pull-up to make his next move, assuming that he's going to the left due to the hold being marked, as well as the high foot placement, and he is glancing over to that side.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This one now the climber maintains an extension of the leg, not only because he only just lose the contact but continues to keep it on even if applied force onto the grip above. This is called flagging and the climber is keeping it there extended because it helps the climber transfer over the weight of his center of gravity over to the highest foot, helping also with the climber twist of his body to keep his hips and shoulder close to the wall. Being on the left side of his body helps the climber when making their reach. Here when the climber was trying to make a placement of the right foot on a hold, his body swung to the right and immediately the climber took advantage of the momentum to send the left hand to match at the same hold. This one is positive in both sides so the climber is able to wrap the hand side to side of the hold and sustain it on the grip by pinching it with the thumbs and pulling also on a close pull up to sustain pressure onto the hold. That way the climber is able to tense the body engaging the core and pressing down on the foot to stabilize the swing and the climber now sends the left foot to what seems to be the edge of the hold. This the climber then will gain more stability once making that placement. Here the climber has brought the left toe to come to a match onto the same hold. This the climber can push away from the hold so that he's able to lean back and creating a lean back that goes in the direction to the left. This helps the climber to sustain the grip with sufficient pressure at the top which makes it easy for the climber to release the right hand from the hold that he had it in place. This is called the rest position when both of the arms are extended especially he's able to send one arm down to shake it off and release any tension that has been built up. This will help the climber to re-energize the right arm when having to come back to the wall. Once the climber is done resting the right arm he will come and bring it to place potentially onto the same hold that he's holding on to the left hand. This one because it's a jug the climber can easily place the right hand next to it. As we can see, since the climber has been able to apply sufficient pressure at the grip, the climber then can release pressure down at the feet. The climber brings the left foot to come into placement where the left hand hold is. This is called matching when both of the limbs are in the same hold. He does this by bringing the front ball of the foot to be applied on top of the edge. When the climber needs to engage on the toe pressure against the hold, he will have to roll the toe into the hold in order to sustain pressure and transfer the weight over to the highest foot, this one being the one that he has brought to a match. The climbers is starting at a sit start, meaning that the climber is seated on the mat and once the climber makes the placement of the hands and the feet on the wall, he will need to raise his hips. That way the climber is transferring the weight over to the areas in contact with the wall. Sit starts are known to be difficult to come off from, so they will add a grade of difficulty into the climb. The climber is aiming right now at a hold that is a distance. This one, the climb, would ideally send the left hand up to the hold. This because it's important that the climber does not force the pull in a way that would compromise sending his center of gravity away from the wall. So he does this by placing the right foot to be above the jug, which makes it easier for the climber to sustain once making the stance. It works by the climber first keeping his left foot on the jug down below. He will then engage on a jump by extending the lower leg to push the climber away from the wall. At the same time, the climber will then engage the arms onto a pull up so that he can gain height. Now that the climber once gains the height, the climber then will be able to engage the right toe to be curled in to be placed on top of the edge of the hold. This is where the climber then will transfer the weight of his center of gravity over to the highest foot, allowing him to gain more reach for him to easily replace bringing the left hand up to be placed on the top hold. That all this motion, while this is happening, the climber then needs to continually keep his left side against the wall so that his center of gravity stays close to the wall and makes it easy for the climber when making the reach. The climber here had made a slight swing in order to build momentum to the climber make a dynamic placement of the hand up to the hold. As he extended the lower leg for the climber to gain height. The climber had released the right foot and while he released it he brought his right hand to come into a match at the jug above. Quickly, once the climber's right hand came to match, the climber sends the right toe to the edge of the jug. This one, same way, the climber applies the toe above the edge and when the climber is going to utilize the high foot when making a stance to the next hold, he will be curling the toe into the hold in order to sustain pressure. The climber here is making some hand gestures. This will help the climber to have an idea of how to follow the sequence and what hand placement he will need to perform when climbing the wall. The climber trying to gain a stability over the swing. The climber then immediately sends the right hand to stabilize the swing, placing the right hand onto the last hold. Unable to stabilize the swing, the climber then presses down on the left foot immediately by extending the leg. Now the climber is creating pressure that pushes the hold away and the right foot is continuing to sustain his weight and by pushing the hand to the opposite direction, the climber is able to stabilize his swinging and immediately sends the left hand after stopping the swing to come into a match at the last hold. After the climber sustains the hold for three seconds, then the climb has been completed. Here, once the climber had achieved the left hand grip, he quickly engages into a forceful pull up and pushes down on the right foot that should still be in place and keeping the left leg extended for flagging out. This so that the climber continues to apply pressure onto the right foot and send the right hand quickly after the pull up to be engaged into another positive hold as the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold. Here the climber had extended the right foot to come into place. This helped the climber to have two areas of support down at the feet when making the reach to the top hold, this one being a jug. Again the climber is able to comfortably sustain the grip as he's able to wrap the fingers behind the lip of the hold which is also another convenient hold like a jug which is also a beginner's hold for climbers when they start climbing. In this case the climber also extended the leg and once the climber applies pressure to the hold above he can keep it extended and this time he will use it as flagging out as he would probably don't need pressure on the foot that is farthest away. Then this foot eventually being on a flag will help for the climber to transfer over the center of gravity, the lates on the core and the hips to be transferred to the left foot that's placed up higher than the right foot. The climber starts when the climber gets to raise the hips off the mat and in this case he quickly made a movement of the right hand to come off to the next move. This one being a jug, so the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the edge of the hold which seems to be positive. This is one of the beginner holds, so the climber is able to rely on the grip and once placing pressure and closing the grip the climber can release the engagement of the arm. Here the climbers is starting at a two hand hold start, which each hand will be holding on to what seems to be an indent edge, meaning that it's positive, so the climber is able to place the fingertips far in by the wall and he will be able to lay the fingers flat at the top edge and then able to hook on the hold when sustaining the grip.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And you know, and ideally you want to jump straight up, straight down. Cause if there's a defender, you don't have a lot of room to come down. And it might be even hard for you to shoot like that and land like that if there's defense there. But again, his weight's forward, he's off balance. Not, he's trying to hold that follow through out there. I'd love it to be a little more in line with the basketball. Again, not bad here. He's got pretty good decent form. Maybe the guide hand, just the way it's on the basketball, but definitely he's shooting with one hand. See these two fingers? That's what, they're the last two fingers that you want leaving the ball. So well done there. Here he gets ready again just pauses. Too much time. This this sense of hesitation here or pausing will allow the defense to recover and therefore you will be guarded. We got to catch and shoot quicker and a lot has to do with your body language prior to the pass. Again, he lands with all his weight in front of that right knee, because he's really kind of, instead of shooting, he's kind of trying to push the ball with that right hand. And by using, but not preparing ahead of time, he's really having to step out and push it out with one foot. This foot. Hold that follow-through. See how the elbow goes out? We want to keep it out straight, extended. Again, see the landing with that staggered landing. A little bit too much weight on that lead knee. We want it to be more, you know, dropping the hips with our feet under those hips. Not bad extension. Follow through. Here's the basketball. Here, you know, he catches the ball. He didn't really even move his feet to catch it. So therefore, you're not getting a lot of legs here. I mean, if this was a free throw, that'd be fine. But let's step into this pass, catch and shoot. And here's how he's catching it. Ideally, if he's right-handed, I'd love for this right hand to come around and like backstop it like a mitt, like a softball baseball glove. Backstop it, and then use this guide hand, the left hand, which is his non-shooting hand, to help guide it into this hand. And then you're ready to catch and shoot. Your hands are ready, place on the ball the way you want it. And then here's the shot. Ball somewhere up here. Here's his follow-through. Again, you know, off balance. Hands are down. Great job keeping the eyes and head up. I think maybe that's the ball. See how he lands with one foot way out in front of the other. He turns that hip in, not really square to the basket. Good follow-through, stays with it. That's very nice. Again, you know, he's going from a stand-up, straight, vertical, locked-out position to just trying to jump straight-legged. It's hard to jump when your knees are locked out. I would just encourage him to be kind of bend those knees, just have a softer body positioning. We need more legs and power to get the ball to the rim. Great 90% upper body here. Good extension of the elbow. Ball comes off these finger pads. Let's drop this elbow in. Bend that elbow, forearm parallel to the floor. See how he's leaning in? Like he's having to jump forward. Ideally drop those hips, lower their legs, jump straight up, jump straight down. Good extension here. Nice snapping of the wrists. Keep this palm of the left hand facing in. It doesn't really have to move or do anything. It just stays as it is. Here comes the shot. He really he does get off the ground a little bit just from that stationary position Just imagine how much he could get use of legs if he prepared a little bit again, though He's we love for him to he falls forward. We'd love for him to jump straight up and come straight down Not bad extension here guide hand much better here that elbows bent stays stationary Snapping of the wrist that gives that ball that rotation that you want to see as it makes its way to the rim Again, here comes the pass. I think he would really benefit if he would just get ready more. Here's the line. Maybe step left, right, or at least bend the knees, drop the hips. Have the hands and arms up. Catch the ball with your eyes. See the ball into your hands and transfer your vision to the rim. Again, his landing way out here in front of that right knee. He's definitely off balance. Here's the basketball. Nice job holding that follow-through. Here he begins to shoot. He is going up on his balls of his feet. He is extending his hips. Here's a good look. Not bad at all. He's got his shooting hand behind the ball, elbow in, guide hand comes off. Let's maybe move that elbow in a little bit, but overall not bad there. It's just he's having to really push it and fall forward which causes him to be off balance. But as he shoots, he brings that right leg forward. Any of this extra movement of the body can throw off the accuracy of the ball as it's in route to the basket. I like this. Breaking of the wrist. We've got to get that shooting elbow in more in line with the wrist. Here the shooter is shooting a 15 footer. I love that he's, you know, getting off the ground here a little bit, but see how he's really, he's having to really push the ball and really take, he kind of falls forward, like has to, it's almost like he's pushing off the left foot only and really falling forward here. See how he's leaning. Ideally we want to be, to jump straight up, be more vertical and land more vertically. He's right-handed, so good follow through with the right hand and wrists. Maybe get that right elbow in a little bit and just hold that guide hand out there. I think he jerks the guide hand in a little bit, but I love that guide hand just to stay in, stay still where it is, not be involved in the shot. Here comes the pass. Is he ready? Is he what we call a ready shooter? And I would love to see this shooter bend those knees, put one foot in front of the other, drop his hips, have his hands, arms up, ready to receive this pass. Go get it. Go meet it. Get those legs under you so that you can jump up. Again, shooting hand behind the ball, not too bad here. Guide hand is there and it comes off, so great job there. Maybe get that guide elbow in just a tad. Again, goes up on the balls of his feet, extends his hips. I'd love to see him get off the ground here a little bit more. Again, not bad shooting form and technique. Let's get that guiding palm facing in. I love how the ball comes off these pads of the fingers. That's what you want to see. We'd love to see more leg, use of the legs to get him jumping and off the ground. Here again is the shot. He's kind of just pushing it out there. See this big step forward like all his weight's forward on that lead foot. Not real balance. Again his follow-through is kind of off to the right. We want it to be a little bit higher in line with the basketball as it makes its way to the rim. Again, looks like he pulls the left elbow back, see the left arm. See that guide hand just needs to stay stationary. We don't want it to be moving at all. Elbow in of the right arm. Let's get everything in line with this wrist. Again, here comes the pass. I always say to my players, are you ready to catch and shoot? Well, he's got it. He's standing straight up, so he's not ready. Again, let's put one foot behind the other, bend our knees, drop our hips, have our hands and arms out from our body with that right hand ready to backstop that pass. Again, here's the shot. Good extension of the shooting arm and elbow. Begins to snap the wrist down. Guide hand here on the side, not bad. Again, though, he just falls forward here trying to push the ball to the basket. We need more legs initially so we don't have to fall forward. You know, he might recommend him moving in here closer and shooting where he doesn't really just work on form shooting and then maybe establish the left foot pivot and pull the right leg into the shot. and see his landing. He let the ball go, shot it, follow-through is a little too high, maybe get that elbow in, but the follow-through is really nice. But look how he lands with one leg right way out and foot, leg, all of the part of the lower body out in front of him. He lands kind of one-two, so begin all his weights forward, he's off-balance, kind of turned inward a little bit. We want to keep our hips square to the basket and ideally jump straight up and come straight down.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She's able to actively engage her shoulders in a shimmying motion that stays connected to the rhythm and helps her to embody the rhythm in a couple of different ways. While she's shimmying her shoulders, she's also able to stay on the rhythm with her footwork and stay fairly clear with her footwork, which shows that she's able to engage in polyrhythm. Again, a deeper bend in the knees, a dropping back of the pelvis to ground her movement would really be beneficial here, as well as some increased attention to dynamics, particularly in the motion of her arms. As the dancer begins with a basic salsa step, moving her one foot out from underneath her, moving it back into the middle, and then alternating sides, she demonstrates that she has a fairly clear understanding of the movement vocabulary here. She's engaging her arms in a way that could use a little bit of refinement, but it was overall appropriate for the movement style, and is able to stay connected to the rhythm and tempo of the music through her footwork. However, she would benefit from bending her knees more deeply and dropping that pelvis back so she could increase her range of motion, particularly in her pelvis, and more deeply embody the rhythm as well as enhance her movement dynamics. As the dancer performs this turn around herself, she's able to spot her head, though she could use a little bit more refinement in the spotting so that she's able to move more quickly through the space, which would help her to connect to the rhythm more deeply. She also has a nice positioning, particularly of her right arm, however her left arm is a little bit crunched over her head. If she were to elongate that arm through the elbow, she would have a cleaner line in her body shape, as well as be able to move a bit more quickly through the space. As the dancer performs a basic salsa step moving forwards and backwards within the space, she continues to stay fairly connected to the rhythm and tempo of the music through her footwork and has added a little bit of refinement to her arms and her choreographic approach to her upper body, which has helped her to simplify her movement and stay a bit more connected to the rhythm. However, again, she really would benefit from grounding into her movement, bending those knees, dropping that pelvis back, and engaging her upper body in a looser, more natural way that would be fitting for the movement vocabulary.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You'll notice that the climber is using the inside foot, so the right foot to hand foot match here while driving on this left foot down here. Interesting start position, just a little weird from a technical perspective, but I think that this is a cool method for starting this boulder. And as the climber initiates the move, they just waver a bit. Try and make them come off of the right hand jug, start initiating the movement, and then kind of back off a little bit. They most likely didn't feel very comfortable on the heel. Also, this is a pretty stressful hold here. It looks not so good. And so, just a little bit of indecision from the climber, and they fall.

So this is her dropping her follow-through on the release of the ball to correct the issues that she's having as a shooter. We want for her to hold her arms hold her follow-through as she releases the ball. So her right arm will be up in the air this way and then she'll hold her left arm up parallel. So on this view you see this right arm is held up here holding the follow-through and then she'll have her left guide hand holding it up here holding it until the ball goes through the basket or hits the rim. This way she can check and make sure that her left guide hand is remaining open with her palm facing to the direction of the right which is the release of her shooting hand and also making sure that her guide hand, the wrist on her guide hand isn't snapping down towards the basket on the release of the ball but holding that guide hand and that palm is nice and open facing towards her right shooting hand. And also by her holding her release she'll be able to see the release of the ball of her right shooting hand that her elbow is really low. On the next shot attempt she'll make sure that when she shoots the ball she holds the follow-through and make sure that the elbow is above her eye level. Correcting these two issues in her shot that left hand, her guide hand and on the release having her elbow be slightly above her eye level will increase her overall shooting percentage and she will make more shots. on the release of the ball you can see her right hand she is in the process of snapping her wrist her right hand allowing the ball to roll off her fingertips of her right hand however she also snaps the wrist of her left hand so it's rolling the ball rolled off the fingertips of both her left hand and her right hand on the release of the ball which means that this is a two hand shot and we do not want to shoot the ball with two hands we want to make sure that every shot is a one-handed shot a one-handed shot allows us to be more consistent in the placement of the ball and more consistent in making the ball go into the basket as we release the ball for our shot we take a look at her the placement of her feet you can see that her right foot is slightly this is like the heel of her right foot and this is the heel of her left foot so her right foot is slightly in front of her left foot which is good positioning as having her right foot in front allows for her elbow to be aligned with the front of the rim however you also notice her feet are really close together so as she bends down to load and gather strength from her legs to shoot the ball her knees are out over the front of her toes so in order this is putting a lot of stress on her knees and this is not the proper mechanics for her to maximize the strength that she gathers from her legs and also we don't wanna put any undue pressure on her knee joints and cause any type of wear and tear so in order to avoid her knees going out over her toes and placing all of that stress on her knees she should space her feet out wider having some space having her feet shoulder width apart is a a good place to start and then she can work from that position on what's most comfortable for her but having her feet this close together is really bad for her knees generating the proper force necessary up into the shooter's shooting motion we can't have her knees out over her toes like this You take a look at the placement of her elbow on the release of the ball. You can see the elbow is slightly below the eye level of the shooter's eyes. On this release, the elbow should be up just slightly above the eye level of the shooter. So when the ball is released and the elbow is up high, it will create that good arc on the ball and drop directly into the basket. However because of how low the shooter's elbow is, the trajectory of the ball is more of a straight line to the basket which makes it more difficult for the ball to go into the basket because the path of the ball to the basket is so flat. A lot of times when the shot is this flat, it's going to end up hitting the backboard first on the shot. If it doesn't hit the backboard first, it's going to either hit the front of the rim or hit the back of the rim. When it hits the back of the rim at such a flat angle, it lessens the percentage of the ball actually going into the basket. Let's take a look at the hand placement of her hands. Her right hand is underneath the ball, which lets you know that she's a right-handed shooter. However, her left hand, her guide hand, is to the left of the ball, but also behind, is slightly behind the ball. With the hands in this position, when she goes up to release the ball, it's going to be a natural motion for her to push the ball with both hands as she releases the ball. We need the hand, her left hand, her guide hand, placed more on the side of the ball. And she shoots this ball only with one hand. And her left hand, her guide hand, is only there to hold the ball in place so it's nice and set in her right hand. And when she releases the ball, it's supposed to be with one hand.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I would encourage the dancer to be more grounded and to really think about practicing the transitions between steps because it can feel a little awkward and stiff because they're not grounded and sometimes they're like a half a second off of the rhythm. And it's not because they don't know the steps, it's because of the fact of moving from one step to the next, there's not this consistent flow that allows you to continuously be on the music. So sometimes they're on the music and sometimes they're off. So practicing not just one step at a time, but the steps in continuation or the transitions between steps would help with the overall dynamic quality and flow of the movement. I would encourage the dancers to really think about embodying from head to toe, because they have really great kind of energy and swag happening in their head, but that doesn't reverberate to the rest of the body, so it can feel awkward at moments. I think it would be really great for this dancer to practice this dance without moving their arms. So really just take a couple of times to practice by just using your hips so it can be more grounded. You can feel the flow of the hips and then add the arms back to see how it should move in one cohesive piece. Because there's a lot of focus on the upper half of the body as opposed to the lower. So to stop that kind of Cartesian split or that difference from the top half to the bottom half, we have to focus on the bottom half and then reconnect it to the top. Here I repeat my previous comments about grounding but also using power throughout the arms. I would encourage the dancer again to think about their hip articulation so we have full embodiment.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As you see the ball is inside this portion, inside the outer portion of the square and the ball hit the top line of the square. So by her hitting the corner there was no need for any side spin on the ball. So as it hit that spot and it dropped nicely into the basket. After she makes the layup on the right side, she uses the proper footwork. As you see, she's in the process of stepping with her right foot for step one and then swing her left foot around for step two to square herself up to have a good position on the left side of the basket for this left-hand layup. However, she allowed the ball to fall through the basket and hit the ground. When we're doing Mike and Drew, the ball goes through the basket. We have to step with this right foot. Ideally, we would like it to be a bigger step and not such a small step. We'll take a big step to make sure that we get to the the best position on the floor on the left side to make the layup as easy as possible. But since she allowed, we don't want to allow the ball to drop down out of the basket and hit the floor because the Mike and Drew is also about having a good rhythm during the drill, having good placement of the ball on the backboard, and also of having the proper footwork to put yourself in the best possible position on the floor. So by her allowing the ball to hit the floor, that disrupts the rhythm of the Mike and Drew, which is an important factor in completing the drill at a high level. You see the ball, she does a good job of placing the ball nice and high on the backboard as it's slightly above the top portion of the square. You also see that the ball hits outside of the square. So since it hit outside of the square, we need to make sure that the ball has good side spin so it can spin off of the backboard and into the basket. On this shot attempt, she didn't put enough side spin on the ball. So it hit the backboard and then it hit the front of the rim and we missed the shot. After she makes the layup on the left side, she does a great job of catching the ball out of the basket and not allowing the ball to hit the ground. Now, although we would like for the ball to stay in her upper chest, neck area and not allow the ball to drop down to her waist area, but the fact that she actually caught the ball out of the net without letting the ball hit the floor, this allows her to catch the ball and step in rhythm to the opposite side of the basket and shoot the next layup. However, this time she uses the incorrect footwork. So although she catches the ball like she's supposed to, I don't know if you can hear she steps with her right foot. We want to take this first step with our left foot. So that left foot, where she's placing her right foot, that left foot will be here step one, and then swing the right foot around over in here to square herself up to the basket for step two. And then she'll have the proper angle to where she can go right off of the backboard aiming for this top right portion of the square. on the left side she again she hits at the level of the top left portion of the square so this shot has good height as you see it hits the backboard outside of the square so we'll need side spin with the ball spinning in this direction for the ball to hit the backboard and spin off of the backboard and into the basket this shot didn't have any side spin on it so it hit the the backboard and it came off and hit the front of the rim and we missed the shot short", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

However, the placement is really low as it's just barely above the top portion. It's barely above the bottom portion of the square. Since it was placed so low on the backboard, even though he did a good job of putting side spin on the ball, it spinned off of the backboard and hit the front rim. And we missed the shot because the placement of the ball was too low. So when we're placing the ball outside of the square, we need to have the ball up higher near the top portion of the square. So when it spins off of the backboard, it can fall down, spin to the left and over the right side of the rim. And it can drop down into the basket before it hits this portion of the rim. looking at the placement of the ball on the backboard you see it hits the backboard slightly outside of the square and it's also near the top portion of the square on the backboard you can also see from this angle here is near the top portion the square on the backboard so since it's outside of the square we need to make sure that the ball has a side spin on it so once it spins off of the backboard it can go directly into the basket on this shot attempt the player did a good job of putting the proper amount of side spin on the ball so that it spin off the backboard and went into the basket The player here shows the correct footwork for doing a right hand reverse layup. When we're jumping off of one foot, when we're doing a right hand reverse layup, we're coming from the left side of the floor to the right side of the floor. We're jumping off one foot, we want to make sure that we jump off of our left foot. And the player here does a good job of making sure that he jumps off of his left foot. We also want to release the ball at the highest point of our jump. In order to reach the highest point of our jump, we have to make sure that when we jump that we lift the right knee up to our waist level as we're exploding up into the air from the ground. So by not getting his knee up to his waist level as he's exploding off of the ground, off his left foot with the jump from the ground up into the air, this means that he is not reaching the highest point of his jump. And so he's not, since we're not releasing the ball at the highest point of our jump, that means we're not getting the full benefits of this right hand reverse layup drill. looking at the placement of this ball on the backboard here it hit the the right side of the square on the backboard. You see it's above the top portion of the square the bottom portion of the square but it's slightly below the top portion of the square so it hits near the midpoint of the square the line here so from this position here we just need a slight amount of side spin for it to hit off of the backboard here and go into the basket and the player did a good job of making sure that the ball had the correct amount of side spin so it went off of the backboard and directly into the basket The player does a good job of extending his right hand and releasing the ball when his hand is fully extended. When his hand is fully extended and the ball is high and away from his body. So this is a good release point for the ball. He also, as you see, has his left arm up. Ideally we would like for his arm to be up a little bit higher. By having his arm up higher, it protects the ball as he's releasing the ball. It protects it from the defense who is coming to contest the shot on the side of his left shoulder. So by having that arm up, the defense will have to make contact with his left arm as he's releasing the ball. While the defense is making contact with his left arm, that will either be a foul that the referees will call, or if the referee doesn't call the foul, it still slows the defense down long enough to where he can release the ball from his right hand before the defense has an opportunity to block or contest his shot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Very little use of the lower body and that non-shooting hand just kind of hangs down by the side. He lets the ball come out, lets it drop down. Ideally, we want to keep it up high. Every time you bring the ball down low, unless you're dribbling around, you know, you have the potential to have it stripped out of your hand. His feet are together. We prefer here stepping on that left foot and really driving that right hip up. He does a nice job of kind of looking up. Again, see how far under he is? I mean, and again, if this is a miss, it's tough to rebound when you're standing under the basket. He needs to be out in here a little bit. He's looking straight up to the bottom of the net. Again, doesn't even move. I mean, he just basically just stands under the basket to shoot this shot. And ideally the execution of this drill involves the footwork, it involves rebounding and the movement from side to side with a layup using the correct hand. Again, you know, doesn't even attempt to hold it with two hands and take it up there. He's just hooking it up or lifting, if you will, underneath the basket. And he's having to like really take it out wide. And again, it just throws off the accuracy of the ball going in. Again, this needs to break down the footwork. Without the basketball, without even shooting, you just work on the footwork, stepping through right, lifting the left, stepping through left, pulling up the right knee, then add the ball, then add the shot. That's the progression of this drill. Same thing on the left, just standing straight up under underneath the net and just trying to lift and hook it up. See the hook shot? He just kind of winds up, sorry, winds up and really shoots it out way from his body. Ideally you want to square your body and shoot in front of that right chest. No guide hand. Again, very little ball control here. Here the shooter is shooting a right-handed layup. He really chooses just to stand under the net and shoot without the use of his non-shooting hand, just to kind of hook it up with his right arm and hand. Not bad lift or elevation here. Good extension here of the shooting arm. But see how he's standing under the basket. Not a really good angle to get your body square and faced up to the basket. Again, standing underneath the basket, straight up, feet are together. When he shoots his left shot, I really want him to step through with that right foot and really lift that left leg. Keep two hands on the ball as you prepare to shoot it. Again, not using any sort of footwork, and ideally for the execution of this drill, we want to see a right-left takeoff, left-right takeoff, etc. from side to side. Here he just leans, puts that ball in the shooting hand here, he brings it down really low, and so he's got a long ways to take this ball up. And standing under the basket is no easy task. Again, see all shooting hand only. There's no two hands to help lift it up. Again, this is his view. You don't wanna get caught under the basket. You wanna be out from the basket. And the reason so is the game is played out, you know, out from the rim. Shots hit and pop out. They don't go under unless it goes in the basket. He gets the rebound and just continues to stand under the basket. Tough angle to use that glass in performing and executing this Mike-in drill. You know, he would benefit from just, you know, working on the footwork, moving from right to left side, along with the shooting, which could come later. He's just choosing to stand under the basket and go off two feet. And just, he kind of sits that ball, whatever hand he's shooting with, is just sitting on the palm of his hand, and he lifts it up or hooks it up. Not a lot of control or balance here.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I love that he brings two hands on the ball as he transitions from side, right side to the left side. I would love to see more of a step through here, but this is okay because he's not traveling and he's choosing to power it up off two feet. Again, we'd love to see more lift, bounce, elevation here, but again, he's got great size and strength, good follow through. You can see the snapping of the wrist here. Again, bending of the knees, would love to see a little bit more lift and explosion, but chooses to go off two feet. Vertical, eyes and head up. Great use of the arm bar here. Comes down cushioned, snapping of the wrist, you can see the fingers going down, the balls aiming for the top of that square on the backboard. Again, he's gathering, knees are bending, going to go off two feet, great use of the off-hand or arm bar, eyes and head are up, getting to a place where he can use that square on the backboard. Beautiful takeoff of two feet. You know, this is okay, especially for a guy with his strength and size. You know, a lot of people would teach the footwork of going off the right and lifting the left knee, but you know, on this drill, he's choosing to power it up off two feet, which is a very strong and aggressive type movement. I would love to see maybe a little more lift and push here, but great use of the shooting hand and arm, arm bars up 90 degree. Beautiful look here of the follow-through, all five fingers, four fingers and thumb are spread across the ball. The ball's in a great space here of moving toward the backboard for the bake. Again, step through, power it up. We'd love to see a little more, maybe a little more bounce, a little more explosion here, but overall, very, very good. Great use of the arm bar. Again, the reason we want this arm up here, if there's a defender wanting to get to the ball, he's going to have to come across the shooter's body to try to block it and maybe potentially foul the shooter. Again, he's got a lot of height and size and strength, choosing to go off two feet, which is okay. Love this use of the arm bar, the right non-shooting hand and arm. Great extension here of the left arm as he lifts it toward the basket. Better job of keeping the ball up high as he transitions from right to left side, steps through with that right foot, pulling the left leg behind, the arm bars up to help guide it to this place of release. Did a great job moving from right to left with keeping the ball up high. I mean, it's hard for someone to get that. I mean, he's not bringing it down to waist level. And look at this stepping with the right foot, pulling that left leg up behind. Great use of the arm bar to guide and protect the basketball. Here the participant is shooting a right hand layup. It's fine that he's going off two feet. I call this a power layup. Love the verticality here. He's straight up. Great use of the non-shooting arm or the guide hand or the, I call it the arm bar. And great eyes on target, great extension of the right arm into the shot. Again, look how he squares his body to the basket. He lays that ball high on the backboard. He keeps his eye on his target by keeping his head and eyes up. Again, love how he squares his body to the basket. That means both shoulders, hips are facing the basket. And you can see how he uses that right foot, the left foot comes in to help square the body, face the basket, and then extend that shooting arm up. Again, check out the follow-through. Very well done. Again, great bends the knees when he lands, arm bar stays up, follow through, eyes and head on target. The ball's in a great position to drop in off the backboard into the net. Would love for the participant in the ideally in the Mike and drill, we teach it to keep the ball up really high here. He lets it drop down to his knees. So being 6'8\", he makes himself 5'7\". Little defenders here could strip that little guard. So let's, as a post player, let's keep that ball up shoulder level. Actually keep those arms up as he moves from side to side. But great footwork, stepping onto that left foot, pulling the right leg behind. Again, beautiful extension. Check out the follow through, breaking of the wrist, spreading of the fingers.

So definitely a nice move from the climber. Here we have the climber in the start position of this boulder, double underclings in this nose hold. I've climbed in this hold before and it's a double in-cut jug. So you can have a jug like this and then you can have a double in-cut jug, which is like this. So it has that double in-cut. So it means that there's more, a lot back there, and that's what's enabling the climber to exert as much power as they are off the hold. And after getting a high foot on this pinch, the climber is able to match this nice jug, tag this intermediate, and then go right hand into the finish hold. And they're matched on the finish hold now for the top. And then the climber, um, after pouncing up to this, um, hold that acts like a handlebar, but it's really big. So it's kind of like a sloper too. Um, the climber back steps on a foothold that's given to the left of the star hold, just touches this sloper rail for a second and then fires up and.

Here as the player is taking these steps, preparing himself to jump, he holds the ball in one hand. We do not wanna place the ball into one hand too soon, as if we're playing in a live game situation, if we're gonna play against defense and the defense hits us even a little bit, we can lose the balance. We can lose our balance or the ball can, we can lose control of the ball. And that's how we're turning, that's how we may turn the ball over or as we're getting ready to jump. Since we don't have full control of the ball, because the defender bumped us a little bit. We can lose control of the ball as we shoot the ball off of the backboard and we end up missing that shot, all because we put the ball into one hand too soon. Now there's situations where it is okay for us to put the ball in, there's one hand early like this. And that's in a situation where we're driving to the basket and there's nobody around. So we're not worried about the defense bumping us or of us losing control of the ball. But it's good for us to practice making sure that we keep two hands on the ball as we're taking our steps across the lane to finish the layup. The player here is demonstrating a right hand reverse leg where he's coming from the left side of the floor to the right side of the basket. He demonstrates the proper footwork by making sure that he jumps off of his left foot. When we do a right hand reverse leg, we always want to make sure that we jump off of our left foot. Looking at the placement of the ball on the backboard, we see that he places the ball inside the right portion of the square on the backboard. You can see here the ball is inside the right portion of the square on the backboard. And here you can see that it is just below the top portion of the square. As he was able to nicely place the ball in the upper right corner of the square, it bounced off the backboard in its location and went nicely into the basket. Here on this attempt, he does a good job of keeping two hands on the ball as he takes his steps and prepares himself to jump. Now when he jumps off of his left foot and he lifts up his right knee, that's when he begins to raise the ball up past his shoulder level. And once the ball crosses his shoulder level, that's when he begins to transfer the ball from two hands to one hand. And then that's when he releases the ball off of the backboard and into the basket. Here, as he jumps, he does a good job of lifting up his right knee to the level of his waist. When we jump off our left foot, we want to lift up that right knee as we're jumping because this allows us to jump by lifting that right knee up to the level of our waist. That allows us to jump to the maximum of our capabilities. When we jump to the maximum of our capabilities, that will allow us to release the ball at the highest possible point of our jump.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He's not traveling, but it just takes him longer to get there. Let's get the ball up quicker, shoulder level. Great job with the eyes and head up. Here he really would benefit and execute this drill a lot more effectively if he would square this right shoulder up. He kind of winds it up and kind of shoots over his right shoulder if you will. The follow-through is good, the angle's good, but I would love to see him square this right shoulder and kind of shoot the ball a little bit more out in front of him where he can protect it. He's a little, has a long distance for this ball to travel when you bring it up around your right shoulder. Here's the takeoff. Again, let's really push up and get our body up more in terms of the lift. So we need a nice big step and a push off to draw this right knee up to get our body up. I feel like he could probably do that a little bit better. And he's definitely going to be more effective and it's definitely going to be more game-like.

Nice job there getting ready to pull that right knee up. Again he's being strong with it keeping two hands on it but let's get it up here a little bit quicker. Eyes and head are up. Nice job there. We'd love to see a real strong power dribble and bigger steps to the basket here. He takes really little steps. His feet are together. Let's spread them apart and really go somewhere with this dribble. His eyes and head are up. He's doing a good job of keeping two hands the ball as he picks the ball up off the dribble. We'd love to see the shooter really, really push off a lot harder with that left foot.

They could just practice very slowly and be very attentive to their fingers to make sure that they're very close and that every single note speaks.

All the notes that they just tried to play is a bit unclear. The tempo that they're taking for this piece might be a bit fast for them. It'd be good for them just to overall practice it very slowly and then build it up over time so that they feel very coordinated. Again, another shift. It's also very clean and the timing between the right hand is very good. To get this short articulation, the guitarist is strumming the strings with their right hand and then quickly blocking the string so it sounds very short. The guitarist is getting around really well during this section and they have a lot more clarity. They're helping use the rotation aspect of their wrist to have more efficient movement and make it easier on their left hand. Here the notes don't sound very clearly because of an uncoordination between the right hand and the left hand. The guitarist should make sure that they have their fingers down where they need to and then strum the right strings. The guitarist is using the tuning peg to tune their guitar. The guitarist is using the tuning peg to tune the guitar. The guitarist is playing these chords with the right hand, kind of using a pinching motion. The balance between the strings is really nice and very even. The guitarist can have more anticipation of the notes that they're about to play. This second finger they're about to play but it's up in the air. They can have it down when this finger is down and that would help their coordination. The left hand starts to become a little bit unclear here. They can make sure that their left hand is being as efficient as possible, but just make sure that they practice very slowly so that they can grab every single one of those notes. The guitarist is using their right hand to play some harmonics. They're lightly touching with their first finger and then strumming with these other fingers. Some of the notes sound very clear, some others not so much. They make sure that they have good coordination, that when they pluck with their right finger that they also quickly come out of the string so it can ring. The guitarist is making good use of having their fingers into the string, they're using their fingertips. This is giving them a lot of clarity for their sound. The time taken at the very end of this piece is very nice and very musical. The guitarist has a really beautiful hand shape here that they're using curved fingers, but you can see also between all of their fingers there's this nice equal spacing. They also have it really well set up with the angle of their arm. Here it sounds like the guitarist is starting to rush a little bit. I can make sure that they feel very grounded in the bigger beats and thinking about spending a little bit more time on each of the chords and the singular notes. The guitarist is doing a really excellent job of highlighting the top melodic line while all this other intricate bass work is going on. The guitar shifts up the fretboard. The guitarist has a really playful tempo here and they're doing a really nice job of covering all the ground on the fretboard. I think they're using their arm very efficiently to help their hand get to where it needs to be. The guitarist has a really nice touch in their right hand, the balance between their thumb strumming and also their fingers is really nice. It's very pleasant to listen to. The guitarist has really great coordination in the right hand, making sure that they're strumming all the right notes. This section comes across as very musical and very pleasant to listen to. The clarity and the coordination needs to be improved in the left hand. Because of their third finger being so straight, they're taking up a lot of space, which is resulting in their pinky having a hard time finding those notes. If they can play more with the fingertip, the third finger, and have a more curved hand, it'll be easier for the pinky to get in and play those notes. The guitarist plays a very soft chord. They played a little bit further up with their contact point, so it came across as very smooth and light.

The dancer should also bend his knees further here in order to make the dance step larger and more energetic. This is the same comment I made before in regards to him dancing flat-footed. He's still dancing flat-footed, but it's especially important when he's turning that he doesn't dance flat-footed and lifts his heels off the ground because dancing with your heels on the ground while you're turning creates friction and slows down the turn and risks you not completing the turn completely in the amount of time that is designated because the heels being on the floor slows it down. Once again, the dancer's arm that's in the air is a little too low. It only is slightly above a parallel line to the floor. It is on a diagonal, but the angle is subtle. It's a small acute angle. He should raise his arm higher so that it is a larger diagonal. The dancer is bending far over in order to reach his hand to his ankle here as we see his shoulders are on a diagonal leaning downward. The dancer should also lift his right arm here higher so that it's on a clear diagonal. It's only slightly above a straight line that would be parallel to the floor, so he needs to raise that arm even higher. The dancer is doing these basic salsa steps forward and backwards on flat feet, meaning his entire foot is on the ground, both on his right foot and his left foot. The dancer's right arm here is a bit too far back. It's behind his head and he needs to bring his arm a little bit more forward in front of him so that his shoulder blade doesn't open towards the back. The dancer's legs aren't as wide and the second time he does the side dance step this time to the right side it's smaller than compared to when he did it a couple of seconds ago to his left side so his legs should be as wide apart each time so here he can afford to move his legs wider. Instead, to make his weight shift easier as he's going forwards and backwards, changing direction, he should put his weight on his toes and lift his heels off the ground so that he would be more mobile.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The climber did get to achieve tapping the hold above but the small adjustment of knowing how the knee is going to be extended or how the climber would put pressure on the toe is important so the climber has an easier time on driving the weight on this once the climber gets to sprint up. Here we can see the climber rocking while the arms are being extended and creating momentum while pendling over left to right and also while standing on the feet, creating pressure. This will help the climber to balance the weight from one foot to the other as the arms are extended. The climber needs to create force in order to go up for the dynamic move. He makes himself really low and squatting down so as soon as the climber is able to have the explosive move for the dyno, then the climber first will start by trying to bring his body close to the right foot that's positioned the highest and push down hard with the left foot. Once the climber stands on the right foot, the left foot would potentially leave the wall and the climber will have to forcefully push on the right foot after the climber achieves leverage. Here we can see the climber chucking up the hands. This will help the climber to gain a better grip when on the wall. Also will help the climbers absorb any sweat that may be coming from the hands. Here the climber gets to walk out the right foot last and letting all of the limbs go out on the direction where the climber needs it to be in order to go with the momentum of the swing out as the climber reaches out with the right hand. Here we can see the climber starting at the position where a two hand hold start. Now each of the hands are holding on to a donut where the climber is gripping with fully on a pinch. This one on each hand being in a pinch and the climber staying down below. The climber is also keeping the arms extended which will help the climber to keep the arms at rest and also only generating pressure with the hands. Now the climb will start until the climber gets to place the feet up above.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He also continues to engage his arms and his upper body in the choreography, which makes the choreography more interesting and complex, and is able to stay on rhythm and embody the rhythm. As the dancer performs this body roll, it demonstrates that he is a little bit stiff in his movements, or a little bit awkward, particularly down the spine and to the pelvis. He really doesn't have much mobility in his pelvis at all, and only some slight mobility in his upper body in general. He would just benefit from really bending those knees a little bit more significantly, and really loosening up the movement in the pelvis to allow for a greater range of motion. The dancer starts with a basic salsa step. He has his arms engaged in a meaningful way. He's able to maintain the tempo and the rhythm in his feet and overall shows he understands the movement vocabulary here. What would heighten his performance is more flexibility in the pelvis, more engagement of the pelvis in general, which would demand a slight bend in the knees, which would take his performance dynamics to the next level. The dancer moves through a series of different movements quite quickly, which demonstrates that he has an understanding of the technique and has really embodied the choreography and memorized it both in his mind and in his body. However, overall his performance really lacks any sort of specific movement dynamics. It's all very one note and it feels very quick and sharp. He would benefit from paying more attention to his movement dynamics, softening in some moments and really finding ways to play with the polyrhythm of the music. And embodying that rhythm a little bit more deeply. As the dancer switches to some more advanced choreography, performing this jump over to the side, he starts to lose the rhythmic embodiment he started with in the beginning. He would benefit from some more clarity in the choreography here, perhaps just some extra rehearsal, as well as having a deeper connection to the rhythm.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So here she steps forward and back. She is stepping out with those knees bent and the heels off the floor as well as a really nice rotation in her arms and shoulders. So overall, this was really great, really great example. She just looked, you know, performance ready, nice transition through the steps and great energy throughout. So here's a bit of a freestyle, so really nice play on the music and the style of dance. So here the dancer starts taking just some two steps side to side and she kind of throws her arms to the side and what makes it special is she adds a little like oomph to the to the swing so it's not just swinging them and step but she adds a little extra shoulder shrug to it so again just adding that extra detail makes it look a lot better. She's also kind of pushing out her hips as she steps out to the side so again adding another detail to the movement. So here, I think is my only comment just for correction. I would definitely bend this right knee so that way you can extend this left leg out a little bit more. But otherwise, really nice job with the arm out and then kind of holding for a second into that pose. So here on both turns, nice job getting all the way around, getting the arms extended up over the head, and just keeping everything nice and smooth and light.

That was the correct time to flip it and she was successful in turning the omelet. The omelette only needs to cook about 30 seconds on the second side and that is exactly when she decides to remove it. She uses the flat spatula and picks up the omelette to move it to the plate. She also drizzles a little bit more oil around the outside of the omelet. This is so that she can ensure that the edges don't stick. As you can see here, her pan is very hot and smoking, so she does want to adjust the temperature down so that her egg doesn't overcook immediately. Then using the side of a spoon, she cracks the eggshell lightly. This could have been done on the edge of the mixing bowl here or on the countertop as well. And using a flat metal spatula, which is the appropriate tool selection for this task, she edges along the outside of the entire omelet to ensure that it is not sticking. She uses the metal spoon to spread out the ingredients into a thin even layer. And you can see that it immediately begins to bubble up, which is the sign that the pan is possibly overheated prior to adding the omelet. In this scenario, I probably just would have started preheating it earlier, I'm sorry, later than when she did at the first step of the recipe. She also seasons with about a half of a teaspoon, I'm sorry, a fourth of a teaspoon of salt. She taps the omelet down lightly to make sure that it's all even. And the last step is transferring the cooked omelet from the pan to the serving plate. She adds a little bit more oil to the pan prior to adding her omelet mixture. This is to ensure that when the omelet is added to the pan, it doesn't stick. Then using a spoon she begins to mix all of her omelet ingredients together. I actually believe that this is the wrong tool selection, that she should have used either a fork or a wire whisk.

Looking at the player going into his right-handed reverse layup attempt on the right frame, some improvements the player can make to avoid having a potential turnover in a game-like scenario is to bring his ball placement position above his shoulder to not allow defenders to have easy access of stripping, taking, or stealing the ball while going into his layup attempt.

This is another moment where the dancer definitely needs more power behind their movement throughout this whole phrase so it can be really dynamic and striking and direct so we stay engaged in this advance also. I would encourage the dancer to really think about the musicality from their finger tips all the way to the soles of their feet and making sure that everything is moving together in tandem.

She played each note with a really nice weight and emphasis that really brought out the melodic contour that sounded really beautiful. The sustained warm tone that she's getting as she moves her hands up and down the keyboard is really smooth and connected and sounds really beautiful. She's able to get this by, you know, holding on to the keys just long enough so that it sounds until she gets to the next key. And that consistent, even warm sound is really beautiful and really impressive. This last chord that she played kind of had like a rolled quality like that C sharp there and then her hand moved over there. I think that might be something that was written in Rachmaninoff, who is the composer of this piece. He liked to write pieces with a really big span of hands, so like you have to reach really far to reach some of the notes in this and I think maybe she had to roll that one just so her hand could reach that note. This is what a lot of pianists have to do because Rachmaninoff is very difficult and again has that really wide range that your hand has to stretch. She's demonstrating a lot of good musical phrasing because in music you don't want to play every single note the same. You want there to be some variety and you want to draw attention to certain notes. And she's not playing every note exactly the same but rather she's growing and she's kind of decreasing speed or decreasing volume as she finishes phrases. And that give-and-take is very musical and she's doing that really well. I think that she went back a little bit during this part. I think she went back to go fix something. This last section, the last few seconds that she played, you could tell that her tempo wasn't especially steady and she kind of lost a little bit of that drive of the direction of the melody. I think because she was just negotiating and trying to find her hand position and it wasn't quite as expressive sounding as it could have been because I think she wasn't as comfortable with the hand positions and just the fingerings of that particular section. You can hear her start to apply more weight onto the keyboard in this last part as the phrase is growing, and it's nice to hear that crescendo. I still would like to hear her use even more weight and more confidence in these very climactic moments of the music. She just played an incorrect note, I believe it was either like a C or a C sharp here with her right pinky. So there was an, I think her finger just didn't get to the right placement in the right time as she was shifting her hand up to the next position on the keyboard. However, this small mistake did not stop her. She continued to play and the musical line kept going. The last arpeggio that she played I believe had a wrong note like right there and there's a bit of hesitation as she went into that next arpeggio but she's continuing to go despite you know making a small error there. As she was moving her right hand to a new hand position, she accidentally played this G sharp here, so she had one missed note, but it didn't fluster her or anything, she just kept going with both of her hands, and it was a very small mistake that is kind of hard to notice. She's playing the melody in both hands with just one finger, but she's matching both hands very well. Both hands blend together really well. She's applying the same amount of weight with both of her fingers, so both hands are just blending together really nicely, really drawing attention to that beautiful melody. She sort of hesitated to find her next note. I think that what happened was she was looking at the music and then lost track of where her hand was so she kind of took her a second to recover from that mistake and she but she continued to play even though she kind of lost where she was for a second. She really brought out this bass note right here and she gave a nice heavy accent to it with a lot of weight from her pinky. She really did an impressive job of playing a scale with both hands that went all the way up the keyboard. So she used both hands to play a scale pattern of the keyboard and both of her hands had an even amount of weight applied and each note was super connected and she also did a crescendo toward toward the end. So she started softer and got louder as she went up the keyboard. So this is very exciting to watch and very virtuosic. Nicely done. The last time that she played that melody, she gave it a lot of direction. So as each note went by, each note got a little bit louder, so it had a lot of good musical phrasing that she used. Each one of these notes with her right hand has a lot of clarity. It almost sounds like a bell and she's getting a really beautiful resonance from the sound by applying a nice amount of weight with each finger but not too much. You can also see that her hand sort of lifts off just a little bit from each note which makes each note have just a really beautiful ringing sound which sounds really nice. You can hear that she slowed down just a little bit toward the end of what she just played. In piano that's, or in music in general, that's what's called rubato, which is means just robbed time, and so she slowed down a little bit to emphasize the end of that musical phrase, and she did this really tastefully and really reflective of the Romantic style, which this is a piece of Romantic music, and she did that really beautifully. She just played a fast flurry of notes with both hands and octaves, and she did it with a really smooth and connected sound by making sure that her hands are placed in the right spot and her fingers are not pushing down the keys too hard. This sounded really smooth. So as you can see, she is using kind of a trill or lots of repeated notes that are very close together and they sound, and to rearticulate them, a lot of times pianists will use different fingers or different hands from different fingers to play the same note over and over but to be able to do it quicker than just one finger can do. So since she's using multiple fingers, she's able to make these repeated notes sound super clear because if you just use one finger and you repeat a note, you can't do it very quickly, but since she's using both of those fingers, it gets that repeated sound really, really crystal clear and she's doing that very well. Actually, I think that what she did was that she skipped ahead. I think there was a certain section of this music maybe she wasn't comfortable with, so she skipped ahead to another section. Because there is a bit of a change of mood between what she was just playing a second ago and now what she's playing. Now that she has this melody again, it sounds really beautiful and she's doing a good job of musical phrasing in that she is growing over time and that every every note doesn't sound the same, but there's a bit of crescendoing and a little bit of decrescendoing. The musical phrasing right here is very effectively used. Some of these left hand, her left hand arpeggios as she goes back and forth, some of these aren't sounding very clear. There's a, I think she might be leaving out a note or two or maybe there might be a certain note that she's playing incorrectly up and down, but she's not letting it stop her because the right hand is still playing this melody with her thumb and her pinky here and it's sounding very expressive. So she's kind of flubbing a little bit of her left hand notes, but she's not letting it too much in the way of the musical phrase and the musical direction. This particular section has a lot of chromatic notes or notes that are right next to each other, so like white key, then black key, then white key, and so on. As her hands are moving back and forth on the keyboard, there's a lot going on in both hands. She's doing her best to get every single note accurately, but she's not doing it especially musically or with a lot of phrasing. She's just really trying to make sure she gets all those notes and rhythms at the right timing and with the right pitches. She's doing a mostly accurate job, but it's starting to lose a little bit of speed and a little bit of that musicality, so this part could just use a little bit more practice. Now you can tell that she's reaching the end of something dramatic because she's in the lower part of the keyboard with both of these hands and she's using a lot of weight to get a really strong loud sound that is drawing a lot of attention to this part of the music. Her right hand is doing an exceptional job of being smooth and connected as she's playing these four notes. They're all very connected and very smooth sounding and she's doing that by applying an even amount of weight across all of her fingers. It sounds very smooth. Now she's starting to bring out this melody in octaves with her right hand as the left hand is going up and down the keyboard. This sounds really smooth and she's bringing out that right hand really well so you can hear that melody very well over all the different notes and that is very expressive of her. You can see that she's keeping her fingers held down in the left hand here to let these two bass notes really sustain and she's keeping her fingers pressed down on the keyboard to keep the sound going as long as you possibly can. With piano you can only press a note once and then it just sustains but she's keeping her fingers down to kind of keep that sound moving is written in the music. In order to execute these quick notes, her left hand is playing notes that are in the middle of what her right hand is doing. So like her right hand fingers are playing some notes and her left hand is playing some faster notes kind of in the middle of there. So she's able to play a lot of notes that are close together in rapid succession by using both of her hands. this transition to this next stormy part of the music wasn't especially clear. I think she maybe could have emphasized the transitional notes a little bit more or maybe even just taken a split second longer to get into this next section. The piano player is getting a really nice warm sound from the piano and you can see that her fingers are very curved and relaxed and they get just the right amount of weight for the kind of style of music that she's playing. There's not a ton of weight right now, it's pretty gentle soft and connected sound. Her right pinky played an incorrect note either like right here or right here. It was a very small mistake. There's a lot of notes, but I think there was one that just sounded a little bit off, but she kept going. One thing that she just did is that her left hand moved over here and her right hand is, she basically replaced her right hand with her left hand and she did it very seamlessly by moving this hand while some of the right hand was still playing some of the notes and then her left hand kind of replaced the right hand playing those same notes but she did it very seamlessly, you couldn't really hear a gap in the sound so that was very well executed, the changing of hands and now her right hand is now free to play something else afterward. Her left hand is now playing shorter notes as her right hand continues to play a lot of different fast notes that are right next to each other, but the shorter notes she's able to do by pushing down on the keys very shortly and then bringing it back up and that's creating a different sound and kind of giving the music a little bit more forward motion and contrast. She sort of slowed down a little bit toward the end of that phrase, I think just trying to find her next note with the hand position. I think that in this section she could use more weight and more velocity into the keys to get a more dramatic effect for the for this sort of more climactic sounding part of the music. I think that she is not quite playing with her full power and weight of her hands and I think that would help make this part be more effective. This part of the music has a very sad and somber mood and she's executing this really well by just having a really gentle touch with their right hand as she plays these arpeggio notes. And again she's bringing out the melody in those notes, highlighting certain notes, drawing certain attention to certain notes that have a certain kind of emotional impact. She played some octaves here with this D sharp here and that D sharp there, same with her other hand as well. And she played these octaves very cleanly with a very clear sound with a nice even amount of weight with the fingers. Her right hand crossed over her left hand as this fast flurry of notes continues, and she did this without much of a break in sound. The notes are still very sounding connected and smooth, and being able to cross over hands like this demonstrates a lot of skill and finesse on the keyboard. She made a hand position change with her left hand right here, and she did that with a lot of ease and accuracy. She got from one part of the keyboard to the other very easily. So some of the notes like this C here or this C sharp that she's playing with her right pinky have a really clear ringing sound to them, kind of ringing like a bell, and she's doing that by giving her pinky a little bit more weight and a little bit more release after she presses down the note, giving a lot more emphasis to that that high melodic note which sounds really beautiful.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This is a difficult task to do with a hot liquid through a small surface into a small serving and he does it very well. Here you can see that he has added a little bit of whole milk to his tea mixture. This is part of the recipe. It could be added in the beginning or here as the tea leaves are steeping. I would have liked to see him use a measuring spoon so he knew exactly how much milk he was adding to his recipe in order to make sure it was going to fit in his serving mug. However, he seems to have a good working knowledge of this recipe and probably knows exactly how much to eyeball put in. Again, the amount of sweetener, type of sweetener, or if you use sweetener at all in your milk tea is a personal preference. Alternately, you could use a liquid measuring cup and put about 8 ounces of liquid into your saucepan. Additionally, I like that he keeps a clean workspace. So right after he uses the milk, he goes to put it back in the fridge. There's no reason to leave your countertop dirty or unorganized when producing a recipe. Once simmering, you can see that he cuts his heat down to low. He doesn't want to completely boil the tea mixture over the side of the pot. He wants to allow it to continually heat for a longer period of time, typically three to five minutes for this particular recipe. Stirring the tea leaves or swirling the pan, either of those steps is appropriate for steeping the tea. That allows the tea leaves to move about the hot water and extract as much flavor as possible. To begin this recipe, he gathers his equipment first, and he is going to put a saucepan over his gas eye on a medium heat level. Once the tea leaves are strained out, they will be discarded and you can just enjoy the milk and the tea mixture in this recipe. As you can audibly hear the water coming to a boil, he adds his black tea leaves, a tablespoon of black tea leaves. This is an appropriate measurement for this amount of water. I would have liked to see him add the tea earlier before the water came to a boil because then it gives it more opportunity to steep. Step two is adding his sweetener. This could be done prior to or after adding your tea leaves to this mixture. Those are interchangeable. He is adding either a half of a teaspoon or a teaspoon of white granulated sugar. Another substitute could be brown sugar, honey, maple syrup, simple syrup, or a sugar substitute like stevia. Next, he measures the water that he's going to use for his milk tea directly into the serving mug that he plans to use. This is a great way to know exactly how much liquid you will need for a particular recipe.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She could really benefit from clearer transitions, more specific movements, and staying connected to the rhythm and heightening that attention to movement dynamic. As we near the end of this performance, the dancer is clearly lacking stamina. She's running out of energy, her movement isn't nearly as dynamic as it was at the beginning of this performance, and she's struggling with a lot of different transitional steps, not really falling into anything that's too repetitive, which is not helping her in this instance. She appears a little bit confused, not making any clear shapes with the body, and overall is just lacking that energy that she had prior. As the dancer makes much more of a larger kick out to the side of her here, she could benefit from a better posture happening through the arms and the legs and particularly the torso. You can see that this leg straightens but doesn't fully straighten at the knee. She could really benefit from straightening at that knee more and also creating a more definitive shape with the foot. It's kind of in between flexed and pointed. If you were to really strongly flex or really strongly point that foot it would benefit her. Her other supporting leg is also in a bit of an awkward position. It's turned in slightly with the foot turned out which is creating this awkward line of energy between the two feet where she's not able to support the kick as well as she might have if she were to turn this other leg out and bend that knee more deeply. However, her arm choreography here is good. It's very clear, it's very strong, but her torso is twisting in a bit of an awkward way which doesn't really support this kick. If she were to align her torso a bit more clearly where her shoulders are on top of her hips, she would open up range of movement in this kicking leg allowing her to kick much higher than she is right now. As the dancer is performing a pivot around herself with her arms kind of reaching out to the side, she could benefit from some clarity in this arm shape. Her arms are quite unclear, they have a slight bend to them, but not too much of a purposeful bend, and they're a little bit disconnected from the rhythm here as well. Overall some clarity in the shape of her upper body would really be beneficial. As the dancer is performing a number of different steps, not really creating any sort of repetitive pattern, she has moments where she appears a bit unsure in these transitions, moving very small and disconnected from the rhythm. However, she finds the rhythm pretty quickly in these moments and is able to bounce back pretty quickly, particularly through her use of arms and arm choreography. She has some really strong arm patterns here where they're reaching up above her and carving out to the side of her in this way that takes up a lot of space within her kinesphere and helps her connect to the rhythm and appear more confident throughout. Here the dancer is creating a really strong shape and alignment with the rhythm. She hits this shape perfectly on time with the rhythm and the music and she has these really strong clear hands with these nice strong arms in general. Her shoulder is twisting on top of her lower body in a way that's very flattering to this shape. Her leg is pointed out to the side with a nice clearly beveled foot bending nicely in the supporting leg and overall creating just a dynamic shape that's really in alignment with the music. She appears very strong and energetic here. This transitional step where the dancer is wiping her hands out in front of her as if she's like cleaning something in front of her with the palms of her hands and moving backwards into this space is quite awkward. She's not fully committing to this step. She appears to be starting a twist in her feet, her ankles, and her knees. However, she doesn't fully execute this twist. She could bend her knees much more significantly and move her arms with more energy and more distinct movement quality in front of her. Overall, it looks like she's marking this step slightly, not executing it fully. Heightened energy, more specific movement, and more direct movement of the limbs would really benefit her here. The dancer performs the arms much more strongly as she repeats this gliding step except moving forward diagonally in the space. You can see her arms have a much more specific shape and she's performing it with a lot more energy which is really benefiting her. However, that energy is really taking over her head and her neck which is kind of moving in its own world disconnected from the rest of the body. If she were to be able to have a command over all of her movement where her whole body can be strong and direct and energetic she would really perfect this step. As the dancer starts by performing a series of smaller step touches and some swaying shoulders and arms to the side, her gaze is fairly low and inconsistent throughout, which demonstrates perhaps a lack of confidence but also maybe a sense of finding the rhythm. She is strongly connected to the rhythm in some moments and in other moments she does tend to lose it, specifically through the use of her arms and her upper body. Her lower body stays fairly consistent, particularly in the step touches. As the dancer's performing this big stomp down into a lunge with a slicing of her arms through the air, her shape of her body is clear, though she can use some definition, particularly in her spine and her head, which is creating a little bit of an awkward line, as well as this back leg. However, her front leg and her arms are quite clear. She's really off the rhythm and is appearing quite awkward here. She's not stomping down on any particular moment in the music, which is really disconnecting her here and creating kind of an awkward feeling to the movement overall. As the dancers performing a series of jumping kick wall changes here, they feel very disconnected from the music and inappropriate to what's happening the music, which is slowing down and giving more of a flowy quality to it where her movement is more energetic, including the jump which is just quite awkward in juxtaposition of the music. I think she or the choreographer could have made a better choice here. As the dancer is performing this repetitive series of slides diagonally backwards into the space, again she could benefit from some clarity in her upper body. She's performing specific choreography here with the arms on a diagonal, but her movement dynamic or her movement quality here is quite unclear. She could benefit from some clarity and some more direct movement, getting those arms straight out with more energy and more power. But right now they're kind of flicking with less of an indirect or more of an indirect quality, which is throwing her off the rhythm quite a bit and overall kind of limiting her abilities in this step. As the dancer performs these series of kicks, kickball changes while she's jumping backwards into the space. It feels disconnected from the music and feels overall inappropriate for the chosen music of this performance. Overall, it's just kind of an awkward choice. I'm not sure if this was choreographed by someone else or by the dancer herself, but it doesn't really make sense with the music or with the rest of the movement that she's performing. In these series of more rhythmic steps where she's kicking her leg out or scuffing her foot out from underneath her while changing and adding a slight kind of jump or scoot with her supporting leg, she has moments of clarity where she finds the rhythm and other moments when she's performing this step she's quite disconnected from the rhythm. So she's lacking consistency in this movement. The times that she performs it with a clear rhythmic embodiment are great and the other times where she's connected from the rhythm, disconnected from the rhythm up here, a little bit more awkward. However, she does have some clear arm choreography happening which is pretty consistent throughout and her feet remain consistent throughout as well.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And there as he's tried to pick it up, you can see some of that uncooked egg from the center is popped off the center of the mixture and now is beginning to cook as it's kind of pouring off of the omelet. He's cut the ends off the onion on both sides. A good way to start, it helps get the papery skin to start to pull away and it also removes parts that you don't wanna use in your food. And he turns it again. He's moved into a level of excessive sort of attending to this particular item. It's well cooked at this point and needs to be moved to a plate, but he continues to turn it and press it. He's adding the onion pieces to the bowl with the green pepper. Not all the pieces, but some of them. He's added a red spice, which I'm assuming is paprika. If it were red pepper that was crushed, it'd be quite hot. And here he's flipped his omelet, which moves it from the French style omelet where you would only fold it or roll it. And this is more of a masala omelet, which also makes sense with the raw vegetables that he put in. They were not cooked before. They were incorporated into his mixture. And here you can see where, as he flipped it, he had more of that raw egg mixture sort of splatter in the pan. He might've needed to wait longer for the egg to cook through more because obviously it was not cooked enough not to make this mess. And he's cutting the half with the flat side down, which is smart. It keeps it anchored to the cutting board, makes it less likely to run away. But he does not have the papery skin removed, so he is now pressing that into every onion slice as he cuts. You always want to remove that. It is inedible. Here he's gone underneath his blade to retrieve his pepper, which is a terrible idea. No one wants to lay a knife on their hand with a blade down. So you want to avoid doing things like this. It's not very safe. He's gotten a pepper. Now he's placed his pan over the heat. His pan is rather large, depending on the size omelet he's trying to make. Typically, you want to have the omelet size fitting to the pan's base diameter. So a little bit more sloped sides would be helpful here. It also just creates a nice round final product, and it's easier to control inside the pan. and tipping the pan to let the oil spread more evenly over the full surface. He placed the pepper in a bowl and now he's working on the onion. He's quickly cutting the pepper crosswise to make small circles which will mirror a dice if he uses a dice on his onion. And now he's stirring it vigorously in the form of a whisk. You can use a fork, a spoon, an actual whisk for this. A whisk small enough for this bowl would actually probably capture too much of those particulates and become a pain. So he's stirring with his spoon. He wants to evenly blend all these items together so that his omelet has even flavor. And here you can see the light color of egg means it's already starting to cook through, which means he had chosen a really good heat for his egg mixture to begin with. There's a little bit of darkness in the center. That's because the egg mixture is probably concentrated there, and that is a little thicker. He's retrieved a plate. He's added some salt to the mixture. I don't recommend this pressing on an egg mixture like this, especially with an omelet. You want it to be nice and fluffy, a lighter texture, and this will create a more dense mixture because you're pressing out any of the air. It also is typical of a novice cook to press things like this because they're concerned that it's not going to cook through enough. So to level up his culinary skills, having a little bit more patience and knowing that the mixture will cook through, it doesn't have to be highly attended, would be a method that he could use to get better at cooking. He's moving the items that he chopped, the pepper and red onion, into the bowl with the egg. He probably could have just put the egg in the bowl with the onions and pepper. He's retrieved a metal spatula from his supplies. He's using a cutting board that actually has a cutting tool affixed to it. It's very unique, not something I've ever seen before, but it can be a good idea. He's gotten a spoon and a small bowl. He's using a spatula to test the edges of his omelet, make sure they're not sticking. And now he's pouring his egg mixture into the pan. As you can see, the full amount of egg mixture is much smaller than the outside area of the pan. What's gonna happen here is he's just gonna have a very oddly shaped, it won't be a great looking circle. It's totally fine. And one more turn. He's got a large skillet with very low sides, it's almost flat across the bottom and over the sides. It looks to be cast iron which is very good at conducting heat and a good option for omelets. He's taken a few of the pieces and turned them so that he gets more of a dice on it. It's a little large dice, but he is getting more of like a square piece. Now he's continuing to cut with the papery skin on the outside. I wouldn't recommend continuing that. He's adjusting the heat under his pan. and a small red onion. And he's used his spoon to break the, crack the egg. It's a great way to crack an egg. Quickly makes a dent in the shell, then you can put your fingers in and get the egg out quickly without making a big mess on your countertop. And you can see his omelet moves pretty freely in the pan. The pan being so large, again, he has to chase the omelet around the pan because it's got a good amount of lubrication underneath it. So it's not going to stick, but it is kind of moving. He's adding a fair amount of oil to his pan. It's a great idea as it's heating. You always want to add the oil after the pan is beginning to warm. It thins then, and you can spread it out more over evenly in the surface. This could be ghee also, but I'm not quite sure. It definitely is an oil of some sort. You also want to stir it enough to have the yolk and the white of the egg incorporate with all the rest of the pieces, but also with one another. He's lit his stove, it looks to be a propane stove. If his pan had steeper sides, he would actually have a little leverage to go against the sides.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

And since it hit this position of the backboard outside of the square, he needed to have good side spin in this direction for the ball to hit off the backboard and spin into the basket this way. As he makes the layup, the ball comes through the basket and he catches it, keeping the rhythm of the Mike and drill. When we do the Mike and drill, we do not want to let the ball hit the ground. Like we make the layup, catch it out of the net, and continue our correct footwork to the opposite side of the basket to make the layup. So he does a good job of not letting the ball hit the ground. However, as he catches the ball, he allows the ball to drop down to his waist level. Ideally, as we catch the ball, we want to keep the ball high around our upper chest to neck area without allowing the ball to drop down. So we catch the ball out of the net, keep it high, continue our footwork to the opposite side of the basket, and then from the high point where we're keeping the ball in our upper chest slash neck area, we raise it from that position to over our head and extend it out and make the layup on the opposite side of the basket. As he goes up for the right hand layup on the Mikan drill, he's doing the one-legged Mikan drill where he's jumping off of one foot. He shows the correct footwork by making sure he jumps off his left foot for the right hand layup. So this is the good footwork. We take a look at the ball. You see he has the ball in one hand. Ideally we would like to keep two hands on the ball and then as we go into our jump and explode to the front of the rim, that's when we begin to raise the ball up from down low to above our head. And as the ball passes our shoulder area, that's when we begin to transfer the ball from two hands to the right hand and then we extend the ball with our right hand and finish the layup off of the backboard. On this attempt, he places the ball inside the square here and it is just slightly below the top portion of the square. If not, it's hitting the line on the top portion of the square. So when we place the ball in this position, we don't want any side spin on the ball. Otherwise, the side spin that we generate will make it spin off the backboard here and we'll miss it off the left side of the rim. And on this attempt, he wanted to place the ball outside of the square in this area here. If he would have placed the ball here, the side spin would have carried the ball into the basket. But since he placed it more over to the left inside the square here, the side spin that he put on the ball would have spinned it off the backboard and we missed the layup to the left side of the basket. Take a look at the placement of the ball on the backboard. It is outside of the square on the backboard. It has pretty good height as it's almost near the top portion of the square on the backboard. And since it hit the backboard outside this portion of the square, we need good side spin on the ball for it to spin off of the backboard and into the basket. And he does a good job of putting side spin on this layup attempt and the ball spins off of the backboard and went into the basket. Here he does a good job of extending the ball high in his left hand and releasing the ball at his highest point out of his left hand, off his fingertips and onto the backboard. We take a look at his right hand. You see how it's kind of down low. Ideally we would like for that hand to be up a little bit higher to protect the ball away from the defense who's on his inside right shoulder. By him having that arm up, it will allow him to keep the defense away from the ball, which is in his left hand, and he can release the ball out of his fingertips. And that right arm will slow the defense down as they come across and attempt to block or contest the shot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She's using her spoon to blend the mixture together, the raw vegetables, the spices, and the egg. And here you can see the lighter color indicates that the egg is already beginning to cook and then you can also see that you got this kind of wavy little edge right here which it's a preference thing. A classic French omelet would never be done in a pan that gave it a free-form edge because the beauty of it is a lot in the perfect circle. She added salt to the mixture of raw vegetables. She's cutting a second pepper, same way. She's cut another piece of her onion off. She's cut both ends off and now she's cutting it in half. She's using a small what looks to be almost a utility knife, which oftentimes can be quite sharp. So they are good for these things. She's retrieving a plate from her cupboard. The peppers are going to add a little bit of heat to the dish, but not anything tremendous. These could be any kind of pepper. They're very thin. They could be Thai bird chilies. I think it's a matter of taste whether you like the heat of those or not. And they're very thin and not terribly long, so she's just cutting them crosswise and they are instantly the same size as the onion in the dice. Now she's got a metal spatula with a nice wide top on it and she's got it underneath her omelet. She waited a while to let it cook further on that base. She's adding a red spice that I believe is Kashmiri chili powder. It is common in Indian cooking and also adds a smoky layer of flavor to the dish. you She's adding her mixture to the pan and you can see instantly that her mixture is much smaller than the diameter of the pan, more like a pancake and less like an omelet in this situation because it's not confined to on those edges to make a perfect circle so it's probably going to get a little less than perfect as a circle. Now she's flipped her omelet again. She's gotten several chili peppers from her basket. She has a very small bowl so she doesn't have a lot of area to move that stuff around. Something a little larger would be helpful and something that had sloped sides. Her bowl actually has straight sides so it's a little bit harder to get things moving around as easily. She might want to whisk this a little bit or just go more vigorously in a stirring motion. At this point she's pushing it back and forth. and she's placing it on the plate. This omelet is more of a masala omelet is what it's called. It's got raw vegetables in it that aren't pre-cooked before they're added to the mixture. It's served flat and not rolled or folded as a French omelet would be. Hers is definitely very free form. It's not a great looking masala omelet, but it is accurate in the way that she's prepared it. She's got a large diameter pan that looks to be similar to a cast iron skillet. It is very slightly sloped on the sides. Now she's taking a spoon to crack that shell and she's going to crack the egg into the bowl. She's lit her cooktop. She looks to have something like a propane cooktop, which is similar to a gas stove. And her pan is directly over the heat. Now she's turned her omelet and it's kind of made more of like an oblong shape at this point. It's moved away from being circular. Not ideal. You definitely would like it to be more of a circular shape. She's continued to cut the rest of the half of this onion by cutting portions off and then making cuts into that. She would be more efficient to go ahead and just make her cuts in the exact same style she's doing it, into the whole half of the onion, flat side down, making long cuts, turning the entire group and then cutting those crosswise. Then that will be a full dice, so she doesn't have to do so many little pieces at a time. She added oil or ghee to her pan. Ghee is clarified butter with the fats removed. This is gonna be a barrier between her omelet and the pan. It also helps to really solidify any nonstick surface so that your egg doesn't stick because egg notoriously is very sticky. She's cut just a small sliver off her onion and now she's cutting it long ways and turning it 45 degrees to make a dice making cuts again crosswise she's loosening the omelet from the pan. It doesn't seem to be sticking but she is pushing her spatula well underneath it to make sure that it's not doesn't have any sticking parts. She has a small red onion she's cutting the end off of.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He also is incorporating the arms, though he could benefit from some additional clarity in the shaping of the arms. He's got a nice slight bend in his knees, which is helping him to move quickly and efficiently, and is overall demonstrating this turn with a fair amount of clarity. As the dancer is transitioning between a series of basic salsa steps as well as some additional movement that's a little more expansive in the movement vocabulary, he's struggling to transition in between steps and is often compensating for this by moving his feet in a way that's a little bit more unclear and also lacking clarity in the movement of his arms, though they are incorporated. You can see here he's got his pelvis dropped back, which is helping him to be more grounded. However, he would benefit from really bending his knees more and overall some additional rehearsals so that he can find that clarity needed to connect more deeply to the rhythm. As the dancer is performing this ball change backwards, he's losing a lot of clarity, particularly in his footwork. You can see that his right foot is sickled and kind of bending over the toe here, where he really should be planting the feet down, performing a really solid ball change as he's locomoting backwards. He's also losing some clarity in his arms. While they're incorporated, they're not necessarily performing the slicing or kind of the swiping motion that they should be, and overall would benefit again from dropping the pelvis, bending the knees, and grounding in his movement. As the dancer performs this ball change step where he's stepping out to his left hand side here, he's got a lot of nice clarity in his feet. However, he is losing that grounding that he had before. He needs to focus on bending his knees and dropping his pelvis back to be more grounded. He's also activating his range of motion in the wrong direction. He's really moving his head and torso and arms and upper body in general from side to side where he really should be undulating on this kind of diagonal movement and incorporating the pelvis more as a hinge here. If you were to be more grounded, he would be able to activate that range of motion in the pelvis as well as finding some clarity in the head which again is really moving in this kind of side to side or horizontal axis rather than moving in this kind of more grounded movement that's emerging from the pelvis here. As the dancer begins to move through some quicker varied movements, he's demonstrating that he might have a more beginner understanding of the movement vocabulary here. He's struggling to connect deeply to the rhythm as well as to find clarity. However, some high points here is he's really including his arms choreographically in a way that makes sense and is appropriate, but overall would benefit from finding some clarity in his footwork as well as the incorporation of his pelvis and his torso. As the dancer performs this lunging step outwards, as he's lunging his right foot outwards and shaking his shoulders or shimmying his shoulders and incorporating his arms into that shaking, shimmy in motion, he demonstrates that he has an understanding of the movement vocabulary here and is feeling confident. He's able to embody polyrhythm, moving his lower body in a different rhythm, a rhythmic pattern than his upper body, which is moving at this faster, more staccato pace. He's also really nicely grounded here. He has a nice deep bend in his knees, his pelvis is dropped back, and overall he appears confident and clear in his movements. As the dancer transitions out of the turns, he's not able to do so with much clarity and precision, particularly because he doesn't necessarily incorporate his head. He needs to spot his head more during this turn to find some more stability as he's moving in and out of this turn, as well as some clarity in his arms. However, he really needs to find clarity, particularly in his footwork. You can see this right foot kind of starts to slide out from under him slightly as he's transitioning from this turn into the next movement phrase, and overall would really benefit again from grounding and from some additional rehearsal to find clarity here. As the dancer performs a basic salsa box step around himself, he again demonstrates what knowledge he does have of the movement vocabulary. He's got a lot of clarity in his footwork here, and his pelvis is dropped back slightly. However, he would really benefit from dropping it back more, bending those knees more, and overall grounding through his movement so that he could activate a greater range of motion in his pelvis. He's incorporating his arms choreographically, though he could really use some clarity and refinement here. While he's incorporating the arms, he's moving in kind of bigger, bouncier motions, which is what's really throwing him off from connecting to the rhythm.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Potentially, the arm, if it was going to go straight up to the hold, then the climber will need to create a body wave, meaning that if he is going to be standing on the lowest foot first, he would do the same motion where he will go out left to keep his chest close to the wall. And once the climber has his chest close to the wall, then he would pose the stance forcefully to then transfer his center of gravity over to the right side. Then the climber will be able, in that moment, to send his arm up to the next hold. Here we can see the climber is going up for the reach and has released a left hand but the arm has come in between the climber and the wall. This could potentially throw off the climbers center of gravity when he's supposed to engage on keeping the chest as close to the wall and the arm being in the middle could be an obstacle for direction as the climber will need to stay under the hold that he's going for the reach. The arm being in the middle could potentially drive him away from the wall when making this stance. As we can see, the climber is engaging at the grips above. As we can see, the upper body is being engaged. This so that the climber is able to release position, release the feet pressure down below, but continually has to apply pressure to not let go or not drop the feet from the hold. The climber does this by first bringing the right foot to be placed at the foot, at the foothold. And then so that way the climber can then release the left toe out of the foothold. Here the climber is starting at a one hold start where he places both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching and places the grips as a pinch hold meaning that the climber is able to wrap the fingers around the hold by sending the fingers above at the top which you will have to create pressure by leaning on the hold and to sustain the grip he sends the thumbs underneath to secure the grip. The climber was able to make the reach up to the hold but did not point accurately to the area where the climber needed to sustain the grip. Also potentially the right foot being in place at a higher stance it seems as his center of gravity was still over the left foot that was lower in the placement. This when the climber gets to push down on the right foot it would actually drive the climber away from the wall which would not be a successful reach in this instance and the left foot has come out of place due to the leap and the dynamic stance. The climber here is going for the reach. And body positioning is key. In this instance, the left foot is the area where he is shifting or bringing his center of gravity over, seeing the chest getting close to the left side, and also potentially making closure to the wall. As we can see, the climber was able to successfully reach the top grip. And to do this, the climber again needs to engage on the grips in order to release pressure for the climber to make a foot switch. As we can see, the climber had brought his left toe to be placed on the hold before releasing the right toe. As we can see, the climber is making gestures with his hands. And this is because the climber will need to visualize the sequence before getting onto the wall. It's important when the climber is going up for the reach, being the right hand up to the next hold, he needs to keep his right side as close to the wall to make an efficient reach. This, he does that by extending the left leg, which this is called flagging out, and also bringing then the foot that's being in place with the knee pointing inwards. As we can see, the left toe is pushing against the wall, and this will help the climber to keep balance when making the reach so that the weight that is shifted to be sustained by the right foot. Also, the leg being extended helps the climber to keep his center of gravity being on the core to be close to the wall as he makes the pull of himself when making the stance. So, that's the basic idea of the flagging out. So, if you're a beginner, you can do this with a little bit of practice. If you're a pro, you can do this with a little bit of practice. If you're a beginner, you can do this with a little bit of practice. If you're a pro, you can do this with a little bit of practice. If you're a beginner, you can do this with a little bit of practice. If you're a pro, you can do this with a little bit of practice. If you're a beginner, you can do this with a little bit of practice. If you're a pro, you can do this with a little bit of practice. As we can see with the climber's body position, he's sustaining the one hold start as a pinch and leans back to create pressure, still keeping himself ready for the next move as he's engaging on a pull up. Down below, the climber is raising his hips. This is to transfer his center of gravity to be pushing his weight over with the left toe that's being in place. As we can see, the right leg is extended and the toe is tapping against the wall. This is to continue to keep the climber balanced when sending the weight of the climber over to the left foot being the highest. And also helps the climber to sustain on that stance of keeping his hips raised. Since the climber's feet are no longer on the mat, then the climb has started. Here we can see the climber shaking his hands. This is to release any tension that has been built up, potentially from having to attempt a climb before, and it can also help warm up the hands before going into the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Ball on top of the foot, rolling it to the right again. Standing foot very far away from the heavier part of this touch. So we'd want to see ideally the standing foot brought forward and get as close to the ball as possible. And then get the right foot in between to open that stance through. Now our balance is already getting over the ball before we take the touch and we can move our whole body through this touch in this direction. And then readjust our feet so once the ball arrives here, we can take some quick steps here, here and here to readjust and maybe get our left foot in here, the right foot behind. Short distance before the touch and then we open the distance through the touch, bringing our next foot around and keeping the feet close and not being off balance and stuck in the mud too much. Just again inefficiencies that are slowing down the overall speed of the ball but taking away fluidity as well and just overall efficiency. So on this sequence from top to bottom, we have seen a couple of inside to inside shuffles and they've been semi-successful. One of the main reasons being that the player is getting their standing foot close to the inside of that ball but not in a space that it's going to get in the way of the ball moving across. So they're allowing the ball to clear their toe but because the standing foot is close to the ball, they can now move the ball-touching foot, so in this case the left foot, through the touch and now the left foot will plant here, allowing them to bring this foot from close proximity to another close proximity spot to stop that ball and to move it forward. So again just touching on balance and the importance of stance and where we're planting our feet, always closer to the ball is better. The further away from the ball we're consistently planting our standing foot, the more off-balance we're going to be and the more inefficient overall we will be dribbling. Again, just another similar stancing issue here. Player facing outside opposite direction of the direction the next touch is aiming to be taken. This again is due to heavy planting, not getting close enough to the ball upon most touches and not being on the toes in between the steps. Just a lot of flat foot steps and bearing a lot of weight on many of the steps before touching the ball. So we see here kind of an efficient route from the ball through here. But again, just some issues with the stance and the touch. We can see a player using the inside of the right foot here to navigate the ball in this direction. And again, with that inside of the foot touch, there's only so far that this foot can go forward when it's opened up at this angle. So it's much harder to take a bigger step along into this space while the foot is opened up that much. It's just going to be uncomfortable on the knee and it's going to put weight on quite a twisted knee, which is not going to be able to sustain the bodyweight load as better as an outside exposed foot could do. So what I mean by that is if our foot is maybe pointing in this direction, the outside is exposed to the direction we're going, we can take a bigger step with that foot and we can land it more out here. And we can still bear weight pretty heavily on that because it's facing straight forward, more or less. And our knee can get on top of the foot. So again, we're seeing this kind of inefficient touch type pretty often where the player is actually slowing themselves down because they're trying to step in this direction with their foot opening up. Again, it's just not very safe for the knee and can't actually extend the distance between the feet as much when this foot wants to open out in this direction. And again, twisting the limbs. So just another kind of inefficient habit that this player is shown and which is kind of slowing down the dribble. We're seeing here again another one of these rolls with the bottom of the right foot in this direction. You can see right now the player is putting weight on the ball, the standing foot is back here and then right foot is the second standing foot. We kind of draw a line through both feet where our balance is. It's going to be leaning over this way and it kind of causes a big heavy touch. Ball comes way wide, the player has to readjust the stance, bring in their left foot to kind of stand in this area here. Whereas we don't really need the ball to be any further away than, optimally, somewhere around this direction to take our touch up here and to help us move on. So, inefficiencies caused by just an inefficient touch type that is recurring in this series of touches. Just a touch on the speed and take note of the speed and tempo of the stepping between touches Very casual walking speed here in this direction where a player is just kind of going with the flow staying with the ball, but it's again at walking speed, it's not a great example of Tempo and just pushing the speed of both touches on the ball and steps between touches We're seeing here again early on another inefficient touch type. So we're seeing the foot on the ball here, rolling it in this direction, away from the body. Standing foot here, so the stride is going to be opened up. But what has to happen is this foot has to stay in the air until the ball gets beyond the space that the foot wants to stand in without the ball touching that foot and being disrupted. So it's one where the player has to roll it and almost hesitate before they can take the step. And the balance is not quite off because once this foot plants, the standing foot is so far away that it needs to come in closer to this kind of area to transfer weight onto this foot and now we can move this foot. So it's just a bit of an inefficient touch here in terms of balance and in terms of speed. Not one I'd recommend for speeding this exercise up. and just a recurrent inefficiency here. Weight put on the ball, weight here, weight on the ball, standing foot back here, ball needs to go in this direction and the body is facing this direction. So just not shuffling the feet, not getting close enough to the ball, fast enough, allowing it to get too far away and then planting heavily on the standing foot, not being light on the feet to get the standing foot, maybe here to allow this foot to then extend through the touch. we see here again heavy plant and a heavy pause right foot on top of the ball again pulling it to the right this left foot heavily planted not on the toes and not quite ready to lean in through the touch just the body overall not quite ready to lean through the touch but kind of pausing rolling it this direction and then following up with a step from this foot again what we'd like to see more efficiency more fluidity through this not pausing not stopping and changing directions hard with the ball in terms of going forward and then it's a pause and then it's a move in this direction what we would what we have seen from this players they can use the outside of the foot so can they make more of an effort to readjust their feet faster with shorter quicker steps and just to just use the outside of the foot to bring that ball through in a more diagonal angle and follow it up with close proximity quick stepping patterns So here we're seeing a nice directional change with two touches that are kind of linked into one series. So we saw the inside of the foot has nudged the ball forward and then we can see after that touch the foot comes across the ball and is now facing this way with an outside touch. The ball has kind of come from right to left, back, from left to right in one series of a touch, two touches. And we can see that the standing foot has shuffled between touch one and between touch two. So with the standing foot taking a quick shuffle to here it allows us on this point as this foot lands on the ground to get the foot in around the other side of the ball and to stride through the ball in this direction. Generally this would be used if there was a defender oncoming from the front. We want to just give them a quick visual cue of the ball moving over here. So they would come in this direction and then we quickly change direction and move it into this space with the defender getting attracted to here. It's not an easy move to pull off but what it does do is it puts a lot of speed in the ball in the second phase of the move which in this case kind of messes up the rest of the sequence because now we've got big momentum in the ball which we have to rush to take the touch through here which then causes the player to rush and take this touch. And we'll see Paul kind of moves forward, the player does a nice save with a pull back and a kind of a V pull push and basically makes it get from here to here to here but this part here was not really a part of the plan and it's happened because of the additional momentum that was put in this zigzag touch. So here we're seeing a sole roll but in the opposite direction of which most of them were going in, which was the outside. Generally the player was rolling them from left to right with the right foot away from the body. Here we see right to left across the standing foot. So we see both feet, weight on both feet. And the player is actually, we can see left arm up here, leaning into the touch. So they're staying with the ball, which is much better overall balance and stancing because it allows the player to plant. So when this ball is rolled to the left, the right foot will be nearby and then the left foot can come around and take a touch on the ball somewhere around this region, which then we can see after that touch, short distance between the feet. And the stance can be readjusted a lot more efficiently to allow the player to maybe set up a situation where now they have maybe right and left foot on the ball and they're balancing in the opposite direction to take that next touch. So more control of the balance, not leaning away from the direction that the touch is going in, but actually leaning in the direction that the touch is being taken in. Here again, just seeing this touch. Standing foot back here somewhere. Very big stance, bringing the ball through this direction. Again if we look at the other side, big stance inside of the foot. Big plant, big distance between the steps. It's just going to slow the player down and not going to help with keeping the ball efficiently close to the cones and having a nice short route around these cones. So again, just stancing issues here. Just seeing here, last cone that the players, really all they need to do is just bring the ball around in this kind of a route where it's more efficient and it's a short distance from here to here. But what we are seeing is this outside roll with the bottom of the foot again rolling the ball way further away than it needs to be rolled. What we could see here which would help speed would be just a little outside of the foot nudge forward into this kind of area. When the ball then lands here we could bring our right foot into this area, swing our left foot in here and just go with a couple of left foot nudges in this direction to stay close to the cone. So again just inefficiency, stance issues, balance issues and just touch selection a little bit off. Still just seeing just kind of walking pace, overall just a lot of weight going on each step on each standing foot and the pace not being pushed with smaller steps, faster steps on the toes and trying to stay kind of over the ball. The player is happy enough to let the ball get far away, doesn't mind planting, reaching, opening up the stride to try pull the ball back and therefore is leading to just a overall inefficient dribbling patterns consistently on this one. Then we're back from that good efficient outside of the foot touch, we're back now to again that more hesitant, slow inside of the foot touch style where we can see here inside of the foot trying to shepherd the ball through this gap. Standing foot here, so right foot takes a touch, lands somewhere around here, now this foot has to try and get in here without touching the ball and it's just as we can see the lean, the balance of the player here at a slant and it stays at a slant coming through here not allowing the player to almost shift their balance to go through the next gap. So it's just a slower kind of touch bringing the ball across the standing foot is always going to be a little bit slower than using the outside foot to navigate. So if we use, we're going this direction, the outside foot is now this one closer to the outside of the direction we're going to. So we'd like to see this foot coming around here and bring that ball in this direction versus the inside of the foot coming across this foot and where it has to potentially go next. So keeping the ball on the outside allows us to move faster, cut out this patient waiting for stepping foot to have enough space to stand in and allows us to readjust our balance a lot better when stepping through using that outside. The last one from here to here to here again just kind of at casual walking pace and not really pushing the tempo where we know the tempo can be pushed higher in this one as we have seen but just consistency wise a little bit up but more so on the downside for the tempo. So in this video here we are looking at dribbling. It looks like the player is mostly going to be weaving in and out of these three cones. Primarily there is a cone up here. The player does visit a few times but stops going to eventually as this video progresses. So we look at the following stuff. Fluidity, different surfaces of the foot the player is using and how he is using those. The techniques, the stance and the centre of gravity of the player, the ball speed, tempo of touches. If there are any repetitive or challenging sequences in here. We look at the steps between the touches, the tempo of those, how fast he is covering distances and then the creativity and consistency within the dribble and if there are any recurring mistakes or recurrent inefficiencies within the dribble. And just to touch on previous comments on the bottom of the foot roll to the outside of the body and Why it can potentially cause issues? we see the ball here stuck under the right leg and Left foot having to jump ahead of the body because of balance issues This is actually resulting from two of those touches consecutively Which causes the players balance to just progressively get more inefficient as The touch sequence went on because again of the mechanics of this touch type and What it's doing to the balance of the player? So we see now it's progressively Slowing the player down and hindering the balance more and more as this exercise is continues Another one of these touches again, look at the feet. Super wide apart before the touch is even taken, so after the touch they're only going to get further apart. And the proximity of the ball being so close to this line, it's going to have to go in a more horizontal angle versus if we can actually get to this ball when it's somewhere around here, standard foot, similar area, right foot, could just come around and nudge the ball into this space in this kind of a direction to get around. We can see here the player just having a little bit of an issue with the Headset, I think it's every time they're kind of jumping after the ball and planting their foot It's causing it to kind of shuffle on their head. So We can see also not only is it having a negative effect on their driven when they're planting heavily, but Also, the headset is shown how Heavy they are jumping into some of these touches because of the readjustment so it's proof that Not quite efficient in stepping and in just the the energy output on the straddle So here we see an example of the outside of the foot touch with the right foot here nudging the ball in this direction. Left foot is standing here so we can see this distance is opening up through the touch. And it allows the player to move at more speed. Unfortunately we don't see this super often or repeating but just to touch on the type of touch and the stance we can take through our touches and how we can readjust our balance and readjust the standing feet. Here is an example of a touch which is more advantageous in this sort of exercise and dribbling in general that I would like to see this player try to reproduce more often and more consistently. Just to look at the stance here, ball moving from left to right, player facing very hard left. Standing foot very far away from the ball, having to lean and pull the ball and twist in one touch. We could see standing foot getting closer to the ball, getting on the opposite side to bring the right foot here. But ultimately the ball should be closer to this kind of range, not too far away from the line of the cones. Which is going to put a strain on balance, stepping and efficiency. Again, just seeing the use of the outside roll with the bottom of the foot here, so rolling the ball towards the outside of the body. As we can see, the ball will get stuck in this area with the standing foot here. This foot then will be brought in to stand beside, and there will be another push given to the ball to move it up here. What would be a little bit more of a natural, organic, efficient move would be to drop the toe in here, kind of slant our foot, and then we can actually open our stride through the touch to move the ball into this space, which is more forward, allows us to get to the next step quicker. From there, right foot steps down, we get left foot in, right foot can take another step potentially here, and then the left foot can come across and meet the ball to bring it in this direction with a few fast steps and a much more speedy route, much more efficient and one where the balance will be readjusted and will be more correct for the touch that is going in the next direction. And then we can see again another good example of leaning through the ball and towards the direction that we're going We can see left foot has been planted here Shoulders more leaned in this direction And the player is able to follow up with quick steps through this touch We can see the right foot has just taken a touch on the ball knocking it this direction The foot is not opened up in this direction to reveal the inside But it is this direction to reveal the outside on that touch And it allows the player to step in this direction a lot more efficiently Because they are again putting the weight in this direction Following up this foot does get across and gets closer So it's a more natural and faster way to step through touches to the right hand side So using the outside of the foot and balancing slightly to our right too So very early on we see an inefficient touch type here. We're seeing left standing foot just being used to knock the ball in this direction. We're seeing the inside of the right foot being exposed to push the ball through in this direction. So again standing foot here, just knock the ball in this direction. Inside of the foot being used now to nudge the ball through this gap. This here will slow a player down because they cannot take as big a step with this right foot through the ball. So if we actually turn the right foot to expose the outside of the foot and use our touch more in this manner, whereas if this foot is more coming through this way, the player can extend their stride through the touch. It doesn't have to be quite this big but in this direction. And they can move in this direction more naturally taking a bigger step. Whereas again we see the inside of the foot coming through the ball in this manner. It's hard if the inside of the foot is now facing this way. It's hard to navigate the ball this way and it does not allow us to take as big a step through and to transfer our balance from this foot to maybe the outside of the foot step, maybe landing somewhere here. We've taken a much bigger stride and we can now transfer the weight onto this foot here and we can bring the ball in this direction a little bit easier and much faster.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

But again, I think her balance is sometimes a bit off, especially when she swings her head around. She has to find a way to do that where her, I think if she opened her feet out a bit and made sure her feet were nice and secure on the floor, then she would have the control and balance to spin her head around. What I do like is she has a really good use for arms. She's able to kind of just freestyle, wave them around a bit. And I do think he should do better at matching that a bit more and really supporting, really just matching her energy and bringing his up a bit because he does kind of bring it down. So here he had taken a step back with his left leg and she decided to lean back but he wasn't prepared for her to lean back so again I think following that lead of the partner because he was not able to support her leaning back correctly because he wasn't initiating that movement so she has to follow his lead she should have taken a step back as well instead of leaning all the way back. So here a bit more freestyle. Again, she's more on the rhythm of the beat more than him. And I think for kind of a freestyle moment where they're not quite connected and doing the steps together, it's important to remain on the beat because then they look more in sync as they're working together. So here they've done a rock step triple step together and then he spun her out and back. So I think a job at him leading and kind of reining her in to dance close and then spin her out and back in. So nice job there. So here the music definitely changes a bit. They start to do a bit of scatting. So I know they were not prepared for that part, but they continue on again with this movement where they put their arms over their heads and then draw their arms out together, which is nice. So here a nice moment where they are back connected again. Hands are correct. His hand is on her waist and hers is on his shoulder and they are walking side to side in sync. Their bodies are straightforward together so that's nice. And she is making eye contact with him but he's not quite looking at her so again that eye contact is important to stay connected with the partner. So even when she runs, that was a bit off the beat. So again, taking your time, really trying to feel and hone in the rhythms of the music so she's on the correct beat. So in the beginning, they're just doing a bit of freestyling movements, kind of just swinging their arms side to side, stepping and traveling all throughout the room. So I would say good use of space, good use of staying connected with eye contact, and just kind of staying together as they move throughout the space. She's more on the beat than he is, so he can definitely follow her lead a bit better. But nice job opening up, just keeping the rhythm and tempo. So here, this is a really lovely turn. She has her foot up in what's called passe, where it's to the knee. I think the foot could be a bit more closer to the knee here. So just needs to lift that knee up to get there. But the leg is straight, her body is straight, and she spins around. And I definitely think it would have been nice if he was there to just kind of have his arm out to support her and be ready once she's done turning. And here he's moving on a much slower pace and tempo than she is. I think she's on the on like a quarter note beat so one two three four he's on the one two three four on a slower half note whole count beat. So it doesn't really look like they're in sync and I think the energy because of that kind of makes it look like her energy is a bit higher than his even though they're on the same rhythm just a different like tempo and I think if he kind of matched her energy it would be a much better. I think with her movement, she has to be kind of careful because it looks like she keeps kind of being off balance. So she has to find a bit more control in her body and her movements so it's not so messy and out of control altogether. So here they reach their arms over their head nicely and then let go of Thuy's hand so she let go her left and him his right, sorry his left also. They're now connected with the right arm as it slides out so that was nice. So now once they are connected, they grab hands here. He spins her around. Again, really nice use of this space and not being afraid to really just move their bodies all around and just kind of play off the music a bit.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

As we shift our focus towards the right side of the frame on our player's release, again, he does a great job at getting his follow-through extended above his shoulder to generate more arc and accuracy it needs to be able to get above the rim and have the proper angle it needs to drop through our targeted area, which is the middle of the rim. As we look on the right side on the player's attempted jump shot, he does really well at getting his follow-through extension above his shoulders and jumping as well on the jump shot to create and generate more arc and accuracy it needs to be able to come down through the proper angle hitting our targeted area, the middle of the rim. As we look on the right side of the frame, as the player is going into his shooting motion, again, he provides the correct footwork by stepping with his left foot first, and bringing his right foot second, going into his shooting motion. A few advice we would like to make to improve on the player's efficiency on his jump shot. On the right side of the frame we will bring the ball placement position a little bit higher towards his chest area. This will help improve on a faster release of his jump shot to be able to prevent defenders from being able to block or have a difficult contest on the jump shot. It will also improve on getting the ball higher above the shoulder to create more arc, accuracy, and rotation to get the ball at the proper angle to come down through the net above the rim for a completed jump shot. As we shift our attention to the right side of the frame on the player's shooting motion, he does a great job of getting the ball placement position to be above his head, to gear the ball and propel it to have the right amount of arc and accuracy it needs to get above the rim, and the drop through the net for a completed jump shot. As we look at the player on the right side of the frame go into shooting motion. He does a great job in having his ball placement position parallel towards his chest. This will help improve a quicker release and to generate getting the follow-through extension above the shoulder to help propel the ball to gain more arc, accuracy it needs to get above the rim and to be able to have the proper angle of dropping through the net. As we look at the player's release on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player's momentum is bringing him backwards, not allowing the ball to generate enough arc it needs to be able to drop in the proper angle. This allows the ball to shift its angle to be able to drop on the rim and bounce out, resulting in the missed shot attempt. As we shift our attention to the left side of the frame, the player does a great job in his follow-through, shooting hand, having it come down, direct it towards the rim, guiding the ball into the right alignment to be able to hit our targeted area, which is the middle of the rim, and also guiding the ball to have the right arc, power, and rotation it needs to get above the rim to hit our targeted area. As we can see the guide hand to the left, palm is facing outward, five fingers are facing towards the left, giving the ball little or no effect towards the release. As we look at our player's release on the left side of the frame, again, the player's follow through hand is coming downward on the left side of the rim, directing the ball to go in that same direction on the left side of the rim. As we shift our attention to the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player's momentum is bringing him backwards, not allowing the ball to get the right amount of lift it needs to be able to generate more arc and accuracy it needs to go through our proper angle of coming down through our targeted area, which is the middle of the rim. Thank you for your attention. As we look at the player go into his shooting motion on the right side of the frame, we can notice that he uniquely steps with his right foot first and brings his left foot second into his shooting motion. As we look on the player's release on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the follow-through hand is shifted towards the left side of the basket, which is where it is directing the ball to go. We will want to move the follow-through hand to come down through the middle of our targeted area, which will direct and guide the ball into the right alignment to be able to generate enough arc and rotation and knees to get above the rim and to drop through the proper angle in the net. As we look on the left side of the frame on the player's attempted jump shot, he does really well in his follow-through hand, having the five fingers come down in the direction of his target. This gives the ball and guides it to the right alignment it needs to be able to hit our targeted area, which is the middle of the rim. As we look at the player's release on the right side of the frame, he does a great job at getting his shooting hand followed through the extension arm above his shoulders to generate more power, more arc, and more accuracy to be able to get above the rim and to come down through the proper angle through the net. As we look on the player's attempt on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player does a great job of having his follow through fingers come downward towards the direction of our target, which is the middle of the basket. This helps guide the ball in the right alignment and needs to be able to go down the proper angle through the net for a completed jump shot. As we look at the player's attempt on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player provides the correct footwork by stepping with his left foot first and bringing his right foot over to step into his shooting motion. As we look at the player's shooting motion, on the left side of the frame, the player does a great job of getting his shooting hand underneath the ball to be able to create more control and arc after the release. The player also does a great job of having his guide hand on the left side of the ball to be a primary placeholder and have little or no effect on the jump shot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And so the power that we generate for our arc all comes from our legs and it transfers through our body, goes up and through our body and then up on the release. But the final part of generating that power is that on the release that the elbow is above our eye level. If we do everything correctly with our legs, but then on the release, this elbow is too low and our arm is at this angle instead of this angle here on the release, then that means that all the power that we generated from our legs is not being used to create a good arc. But now it is going towards the power to go straight towards the basket. Now it's traveling towards the basket with too much force and too flat. And that's how we get these hard shots where we hit the front of the rim or these hard shots where it hits the back of the rim and the goal comes off long. We have to make sure that the power that we use from our legs is generated to make that good soft arc so then when it goes down into the basket, it hits the basket and goes in nice and softly. we take a look at his follow through of his right hand. He has a nice follow through, snapped the wrist, allowed the ball to roll off of his fingertips to create good backspin on the ball. So this is a really good follow through. We also can't see the back of his hand from this view. So from this view, from this view right here, since we're unable to see the back of his hand, we know that he did a good job of follow through and snapping his wrist and his fingers are pointing towards the direction of the basket. Now if we take a look at his guide hand, his left hand guide hand, you see that his palm is facing kind of downward. His fingers are in the right direction. They're pointing towards the basket. But ideally we don't want to turn the wrist to where the palm is facing downward on the basket. Ideally we would like for that palm to be open and facing the direction of his right hand, shooting hand, as he releases it. So the palm should be facing directly to his right and open directly to his right and not open and facing downward towards the ground. We don't want the palm open and facing in the direction of the basket. The fingers of the guide hand can be facing towards the basket as we release it, but we don't want the palm to be facing the direction. That palm should always be pointed directly to the right on the release. When the palm is open directly to the right on the release, that guarantees that there's no interference on the ball from our left hand, from the guide hand, as we release the ball. we take a look at his feet plate the placement of his feet his right foot is slightly in front of his left foot this allows for his elbow to be lined up directly with the front of the rim and his elbow is in so this is good foot placement it's nicely spaced and he's on balance with each shot As he jumps to release the shot, his momentum is actually going backwards and away from the basket. You can tell as he releases the ball, the momentum of his body is going a little bit backwards. In this situation, we want our momentum to either be straight up and down, or even slightly forward. Not too much forward, but our momentum should be heading slightly towards the basket on our shot. By us having our momentum going away from the basket, that makes the shot more difficult. You take a look at his hand placement on the ball. You can see his left hand is on the side of the ball, on the left side of the ball. And his right hand is underneath the ball with his right index finger placed in the middle of the ball. This is excellent hand placement on the ball.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So she's just come out of a basic step. Really nice use of the pelvis there with the basic step and nice job doing this sort of windmill arm here as she's bringing this knee up. Might be a little bit better if this was a straight elbow and this was a straight elbow just to kind of add some clarity to the shape. But the pathways are really nice with the two arms kind of going in these opposite windmill directions. Again using the hips as the pivot point so that she ends up having to do a bunch of movements turning in and out the hips in order to turn around. She's not spotting her head either so it makes this turn look kind of clunky. Again incorrect turn technique. She's turned to this externally rotated this hip and is going to turn her body around the hip and that's not Good turn technique. We never want to plant it foot in turns for the most part I'd love to see her on the ball of her foot and keeping these hips parallel with each other Driving the turn from the pelvis turning around and the ball of the foot is the pivot point Pretty good preparation here for the turn, a little bit turned in, so nervous that she's going to do the thing where she rotates around her hips instead of her balls of her feet, but we'll keep watching. Here she's brought the hands up to the head, not quite touching the head, and she's rotating the head here in this circle, but not again not exaggerated enough to be really read as a very clear moment. And I think it's because she's still a bit distracted and confused about what she's supposed to be doing. Again, looks like she's kind of communicating with her eyes with the instructor, looks a little bit hesitant, a little bit confused about what she's supposed to be doing. It's almost like she just decided to just ignore the instructor because she just kind of goes for it here. And this looks so good, like really nice shape, really good strength through this plie and with some energy through the back leg. Beautiful shapes here, really strong, very clear, lots of energy and grace through the fingers. Also like this nice kind of glance over the shoulder to emphasize this line looks super sassy, great expression in the face. This is all of a sudden, bam, it's coming together. Great stage presence, great shape. Great job bringing the arms up here to a nice straight elbow, really clear shape with the shoulders, energy out the fingertips. It's got a bit of a bouncing quality at the top of the movement because she doesn't just bring it up and hold it, she kind of brings it up and back down again. So I'd like to see it just a bit more clear and held for just a second before dropping it. Again, looking over the instructor either for help or because she's just distracted. So this is not, this whole video is just not performance ready yet. This is a really nice unexpected touch. She's got this arm nice and strong out here and has brought this other one in front and around to this side of the arm. This is really gentle sort of caress of her arm, which is just a really like unexpected and very brief moment, but looks really, really lovely. So what I'm saying is she's sort of like adding these details onto what she's doing that make it look like not just a cake and not just a cake with frosting, but like a cake with frosting and sprinkles and, you know, flower patterns and happy birthday written on it. So she's adding these details that really make it look more complete. Again, really nice isolation through the ribcage. Very, very skilled dancer. What's really nice is that she's also on the balls of her feet here and a little bit of a plie through the knee, a little bit of soft knee. So that's helping her to isolate through these different parts of her body effectively. She does initiate the movement in the same way as the previous side, so this is the second time she's done this movement. Unfortunately, she doesn't quite hit the shape as well, so she doesn't follow through with it. She kind of lets it go a bit too early, so we don't get to enjoy this shape, and it cuts off the nice texture that she established on the other side. Really nice movements here. She's doing a sort of box step here with the basic salsa step really nice Very strong very clear wish she was on the balls of her feet, but I'll the rest of it looks so good I'll grant her that that the arms look really graceful really well coordinated with the legs This is really, really beautiful. She's doing this really nice like undulating movement kind of forward and back with the pelvis as well as kind of accentuating that with sort of the opposite movement with the hands and arms. Really, really nice and also there's a bit of a attack at the beginning of this movement that just adds a little bit more texture to what she's doing. It looks really strong. She's very hesitant here to begin. I hear someone shouting at her. I think it's the instructor or the choreographer. I don't think she really knows what she's supposed to be doing. So that's not a great way to start. I don't know if it's that she doesn't know what she's supposed to be doing or if she's being, if she's just distracted by the instructor. But either way, we can't let ourselves get distracted while we're dancing. So this is a really weak start to her dancing here. Yep, so definitely planting one foot, rotating around the hip. That's incorrect turn technique. It's going to make this turn a bit wobbly and less efficient and effective and clear than it could be. The arms are pretty strong though, nice held position here. Looks like she may be spotting towards where she wants to go, so we'll just keep tracking that. I like that after she hit the knee with the left hand, she kept the windmill pattern going with both arms, which looks really, really strong. It's even looking better now than it did at the beginning of the windmill because she's got a straight elbow here, so it's really, really nice pathways in the air. Another little hesitant mincing step moment, again maybe forgetting what she's supposed to do. She also sort of just briefly glanced over toward the instructor again, so I think, you know, she just needs to really work on the choreography before performing it and make sure she understands it and knows it very well. She's starting to recover from that distraction and is doing this nice kind of isolation through the pelvis and rib cage. I can tell that she's very skilled at this but she's not doing it in a very exaggerated way and I think that's because she's still distracted. Really nice here. She's brought this arm up to this really beautiful shape energy out the fingertips nice straight elbow I like that the hand is really clearly placed on the thigh here but what's really the most interesting part about this shape is the way that she sort of initiates it from the chest and Then allows a little bit of a pulse to happen with the head coming in this direction Slightly it just looks really beautiful and just adds again more texture more dynamics to what she's doing and shows really excellent Control over her whole body and coordination over her whole body and using the whole body for the whole dance Nice job here kind of bringing this hand up and around the head in a nice way kind of following through with that hand looks really strong. This is not really an effective moment for her either. This is meant to be a leap onto this foot as far as I can tell with this foot coming around and she doesn't leap, she steps onto it so she doesn't have enough momentum to really make this as big and exaggerated as it could be. Still recovering or not still recovering but still in process of kind of figuring out what she's supposed to be doing the instructor continues Giving her commands and so I think it's just a little bit confusing a little bit hesitant so she really needs to get really solid in the choreography and also Try not to get distracted while dancing", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here they are playing a G chord while strumming all six strings of the guitar with the thumb. When practicing the last few phrases of this etude further, it would help to slow down the tempo a bit and watch the right hand fingers to try to smooth out the finger style pattern's motion, make it more connected and smooth rather than three separated motions. They are playing at a fast challenging speed and are demonstrating great accuracy with the pitch and also aim of the right hand fingers to play the strings individually. When performing the major scale, they alternate it between the pointer and middle fingers on the right hand when picking and playing each pitch. They again performed the same five pitches of the major scale here. There is the slightest bit of a buzzy sound quality to some of the pitches in this phrase. It would just help to watch the left hand fingers, make sure they're a little bit more curved and pressing firmly in the center of each fret to get the clearest possible sound. Here the guitarist is performing a different etude. They are demonstrating excellent right and left hand technique. You can see the left hand fingers are curved. They're getting a very clear sound to their playing and the right hand is continuing to execute the finger style pattern that is used for this etude multiple times in a row with a steady tempo. Here the guitarist is performing this section of the etude at a faster tempo. You can see them holding their chord shape in the left hand while they play the alternating finger style pattern using the thumb, pointer, and middle fingers. Repeatedly, they are able to play this section of the piece while maintaining this faster speed and accuracy with the pitches and strings that are being played. They now demonstrated the G chord within the phrase, so they played a few chords before the G chord leading into it and a few chords after. They are reincorporating this chord back into this section of the music. Here the guitarist demonstrated the first five pitches in their major scale. You can see they are demonstrating proper left hand position. Fingers 1, 2, 3, and 4 are curved and the thumb is on the back of the neck of the guitar. Here the guitarist demonstrated playing an individual string and pitch followed by multiple strings or a chord. The guitarist is shifting on the fretboard to lower pitches. As they shift, they are maintaining great finger position. The fingers are curved and they are getting a clear sound. Here the guitarist is performing a portion of their etude. They are using a finger style pattern, are executing it successfully with the right hand fingers, and are getting a clear sound to their playing while maintaining a steady tempo. They demonstrated this phrase again with two C chords instead of a G chord. That's what the guitarist was expecting to hear, but this pattern is incorrect. Here they performed the major scale starting with the first pitch and working their way up to the highest pitch in the scale. They demonstrated proper shifting and again are getting a nice clear sound quality to their playing and added some vibrato on the top pitch. They played this portion of the scale with accurate pitches and a clear sound quality.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She would also benefit from finding more separation between her feet here, which would give her a greater range of motion and a larger kind of base for her movement. As the dancer continues through the choreography, she demonstrates a basic understanding of the movement vocabulary. She's able to incorporate both her arms and her legs with a fair amount of clarity. However, she would really benefit from being more grounded in her movement, bending her knees, dropping her pelvis back, and activating a greater range of motion in her pelvis and up through her upper body, which would help her to embody the rhythm of it more deeply. As the dancer begins with some basic positioning of the body, she appears confident and connected to the rhythm. She's incorporating her arms choreographically in a way that's clear and appropriate and has a lot of clarity in her footwork in general. In these moments where the dancer needs to move a bit more quickly with a bit more precision, she really struggles to stay consistently connected to the rhythm. As she's kind of launching her arms backwards into the space and straightening through her legs, she's struggling to connect to the rhythm here and finding clarity in her movement. Overall she would benefit from being more grounded in her movement, keeping a soft bend in her knees, and finding more clarity in her movement overall. As the dancer performs this basic salsa step which locomotes her slightly to the left side, she really demonstrates a moment of clarity here. She's got a lot of nice movement in her pelvis, a soft bend in her knees, clarity in her footwork, as well as clarity in the incorporation of her arms choreographically. Overall, this is a real moment of shine for the dancer. She appears confident and connected to the rhythm. As the dancer performs this layout backwards where she's elevating her left leg and kind of standing on her right leg as a supporting leg, she would really benefit from bending this right knee quite a bit more to gain more stability, as well as a greater range of motion in the pelvis and of the working leg. She would also benefit from pushing her pelvis upwards, extending this left leg further upwards towards the sky, and finding a bit more clarity in the connection between her arms, her head, and her neck here.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I think, again, yeah, the only thing I would say is when he does the knee outward, he has to kind of get higher and more to the right to spring off of it. Whereas if you drop that knee down to the left, he could kind of sit on top of that and then really explode for that knee. So it kind of brings his right hip into the wall. It almost be kind of going to the right, just kind of slightly leaning back into it.

His foot, his left foot does pop out. So this could be where this right knee is facing outwards. He could have maybe twisted that right knee inwards and drove the hip into the wall and done like a twist lock into that undercling. So it kind of brought his torso, his chest into that forearm and bicep and twisted it and then tried to dead point it that way. But he makes it and is still able to hold on even with the one foot cutting out. Again, just a really good positioning. You know, he makes this big move, then keeps his arm straight and shifts his weight underneath it. So that way he's not pulling through it or having to pull his body into a better position. He just kind of like sinks into the good position and then boosts his feet around. This little thing as he makes his first move, he kind of hits this up and his body weight is more to the right. So he's kind of gestoning this hand, but then he shifts his whole body to the left. So he can kind of be underneath it, not having to pull through it. Trying to be as straight below the hold as possible. And I was kind of cutting feet here, so this is me not the best thing but he's on a lot better hand holds See the whole Duke it quite jokey he doesn't make it the top of all Somebody he is turning a little tired And hey, that's where you know having that right right knee turned in to kind of save the fluff of him cutting could have a saved him some energy This next move is going to be kind of hard. So he's going up to this undercling. So that means he wants to be as far up and right as possible. So he's going to get his feet around. He does a really good job of walking his feet through and not just muscling through with his arms. You know, he's quite locked off right now. That's just to kind of hold the hold. He does a really good job walking his feet up and kind of twisting his knees and hips in and then doing a coordinated effort to move up. So he really does this move and this sequencing through his lower body first and then lets him transfer that good position to his upper body. Now I like this next move, he sets his heel, I kind of got the frame a little wrong, but he could put his toe on, but the toe is enough to force him to get further over to the right so he can stand up through it. But by setting the heel on here, he can kind of just pull straight down through the heel right away, and then pull through his arm to get up there. So the heel really lets him pull through, and almost gives him like a third arm to kind of be pulling with, instead of having to push with the feet. And it's a big enough hold that it really lets him like lock down on that heel.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Here he's able to twist his left leg in and out in isolation, quickly, efficiently, and on rhythm, as well as engage choreography in his arms and upper body. While the dancer is able to move quickly and efficiently with a lot of clarity in his choreography and engage his whole body, this is a moment where he struggles a little bit. He would benefit from a softening of the spine and the pelvis, which is lacking a significant range of motion, which is demonstrated in this sort of body roll. He would also benefit here from bending the knees and dropping the pelvis back more, which would help ground him to give him that full range of motion in his pelvis and up through his spine. As the dancer begins his performance, he demonstrates that he has an advanced understanding of the movement vocabulary as well as rhythmic embodiment. He is able to engage polyrhythm in his body, moving his upper body, in this case his hands, at a different rhythm and a different tempo than his lower body or his feet. He engages all parts of his body, his head, his torso, his legs, and his arms. However, he would benefit from a little bit more motion, particularly in the pelvis, and a softening of the spine to add an interesting additional dynamic to his movement. The dancer performs a turn around himself, which he's able to do quickly and efficiently, particularly thanks to the spotting of his head here. He also keeps his movements small and right underneath his shoulders and his pelvis, which helps him to move quickly. The dancer performs a series of increasingly quick salsa movements. He's able to really engage his arms and his lower body and really embody the rhythm throughout his entire body, which shows that he has an advanced understanding of the movement technique as well as the rhythmic embodiment here.

She's also swinging her arms and they're not just swinging side to side but they do draw back behind her and then coming up. So really good use of the arms in that part. I'll say overall the stands did a really good job. I think this is a good basic set of choreography. One thing that helped a lot was the counting. So if you have a basic beginner class, either having the counts available or having the teacher count, I think it really helped for the dancer to connect with the music and make sure they're doing all the steps correctly and with the correct timing. So here she's doing a toe heel step again. Really good job. This is something I would teach my youngest students in tap class as they're going across the floor. So she's really good job bending her knees, getting that heel up off the floor and then dropping it down and accenting on the heel, as well as swinging her arms forward and back to go along with the music. So here she, after she twirls forward, she's doing a kick ball change, going backwards, which is nice. And it's really good that she's counting because it's, I think it'll help whoever is learning to make sure they're going, bop, bada, one and two, three and four, five and six. So it's right on the beat of the music. that time I noticed she right after she jumped out she slowly started to shift her arms to the right side so that way her weights will start to kind of move over so that way she can then step tap to the left. So really you have to kind of think you know what is happening next and not just think about what's happening in the moment when you want to shift your weight without being very bold about shifting your weight or just jumping on just one leg. If you're jumping on both you want to be able to shift easily and quickly. So here she's stepping out with the second position with both knees bent out and she does it I think three or four times and the first time was a really nice open so I would suggest that she continued to stay the same way. She started to make it smaller and so then her energy kind of went down because it got smaller so I would have opened it out and maybe if you get tired just go a little slower so go on the four counts instead of doing every two counts and make it a little longer so the music so the movement is a little more exaggerated. So these swings that she's doing, a lot of them are really simpler and right now she's going back and forth. I would suggest maybe turning around facing the other direction or just coming up further to the front but definitely I would give that a little more variety so it's not just still staying on this line going back and forth. So here she does a really good job with her sway back and forth. She's going sway one, two, sway three, four, then same side, seven, eight, sway two, three, four, same side. She's doing a really good job engaging her full body again using her arms as well as like traveling across the floor so she's using the full space that she has. So here the dancer is starting. One great thing is that she counted in so that just helps so that way whoever is learning is starting at the correct time so counting five six seven eight and then she's also helping to count with the music with the movement that she's doing so she's calling a tap together so she's stepping her foot out and then kind of sliding it in and then stepping with the other leg and sliding it in and she's also bending her knees so she's using her lower half of the body and she's not necessarily using her arms to dance but just to point out that that is what her leg is doing So here she's doing a toe heel step where she steps on her toe, drops her heel, then other leg steps toe, drop heel, and she's doing a good job at using her space. She travels around and she says moving in a circle and then she reverses back after she comes around forward. She's also swinging her arms and keeping her full body engaged as well. So really good swivel again. She's decided to point her fingers down to the floor and bending her knees nicely and then just staying up on her toes as she twists her body keeping her chest area straight but then the bottom half is twisting. So here she just did a step tap side to side. She was also swaying her arms nicely side to side and then jumping out. When you're teaching this, it's important again to understand weight shift. So if she's going to step back out with her right foot, she wants to make sure when she jumps out, even though it may look like she's jumping out and her weight is even, she kind of wants to either slightly lean or just have in her mind that I'm going to put more of my weight onto my left side so that my right side is free to move.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

It's important that the climber always glances down to make sure that she makes an accurate foot placement before starting to climb. When the climber was making the right hand to come into place at a match, we can see the climber's center of gravity has dropped because of the sudden disconnection of the right foot on the hold. It's important that the climber continues to apply pressure at both of the feet when making the transition of the right hand. The climber transferring over the hand to bring it over to a match at the undercling the right foot has come out of place This the climber will have to sustain from falling by holding tightly onto the grips The climber right now is approaching the wall to assess the first hold. This is a start hold so the climber eventually will have to start with placing both of the hands onto the same hold. And bringing the right hand to come into place over the left side of the hold tells me that the climber must keep the right hand in place to the hold when performing the move and releasing the left hand first. The climber is sending the left hand over to the next hold. The foot positioning was slightly shifted. In this one the climber rolled the toe inwards onto the hold and is mostly applying pressure with the inner area of the toe. Now the knee has come inwards to create a knee drop to raise the hips to make it easy on not applying yet pressure onto the left hand grip as the climber continues to adjust it. We can see how the climber this time has brought the palm to be facing up and slide the fingers behind the lip of the hold. This one still sustaining onto a jug. This type of hand placement is called an undercling and this one can be applied with more force as the climber is able to apply the thumb on the outside lip of the hold. When the climber creates pressure then the climber will be able to close the grip and pinch onto the hold and after transfer over the weight by leaning back as the climber right now has the arm extended making it easy to sustain. Once the climber has placed the right foot, has lifted the left foot to come into place at this block. This is a larger foothold so the climber is placing the ball of the foot over the corner of the hold. So that the climber later, when transitioning out left, which is the next hold at reach, the climber will be able to roll the toe over the hold onto this small space. As we can see the climber chooses to keep the hands side by side and is placing both of the hands onto the same hold. The type of hold she is sustaining is called the jug as the climber is able to wrap the hands around the lip of the hold. Both of the hands position into the same hold, this is called matching. Now we can see the climber has brought the left foot to come into place first. And once the climber lifts the right foot off the mat, then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So because the hold is a pinch in a slanted position, typically it's very difficult to hang on to this hold just by itself. So the best way to hang on to it is actually by hanging back and over to the right of it. And this is what we call a layback position. And a layback position is really good, especially when you're able to reinforce it with the use of your legs. So here we can see that the Clamor is doing a good job of making sure that a lot of his body weight is placed on that leg. And he's doing his good job of pressing back on that foothold. And this helps to keep his body over to the right of that handhold. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring his right hand into the next handhold And in this position he is still hanging on with that left-hand pinch And then he is still or he was able to switch his feet so the right foot is on that starting foothold now So one of the things I like about this position here is the climber was able to keep his right foot on that Foothold right there which helps to reinforce Keeping tension on that foot and this allows him to get really good control of his hands and where they're being placed in this movement But one thing I am noticing that with this left flagging foot It's kind of being in a bent position being pulled away from the wall So this only helps to pull the rest of his body away from the wall as well Which works against him I'm so I would always encourage climbers to make sure that their flagging foot is in a very intentional manner kind of straight leg and Pressed up against the wall. So that way it helps to press their body closer to the wall", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So he should have been tapping his right foot in. Now he's tapping his left foot in. So he was supposed to turn around, stepping five, six, seven, tapping eight, or stepping on his left foot, right foot, left foot, tapping on his right foot on eight. But he extended instead his right foot outward on count eight and then tapped his left foot on count one. So actually he's going to be a count late now because he should be stepping outward on count one. And instead he's tapping his feet together on count one here. The dancer is doing extra movements with his head looking to the side and then the left side the right side Kind of on a diagonal up sometimes on a diagonal down these extra movements with his head are just that they're extra movements And they're not necessary and they're also not aligned with the rest of his spine So it looks like his head is moving independently than the rest of his body. I mean in this way it is distracted The dancer completes this turn directionally correct again. Before he was traveling to his right when he was facing back, so it was also the right of our screen. Now he turns around and continues to go to his right. The turning around was replacing moving to his left as he turned around his left shoulder. And now he's again moving towards his right, which is now our left side of the screen since he's facing forward. So those directions are correct. The dancer executes this turn better because before he was facing the back of the room and Traveling to his left and our left side of the screen since he was facing the back of the room So now when he turns around on which was as if he was going to his right and our right side of the room Upon completion of that turn he should be traveling again towards his left Which is now on our right side of the screen because he's facing forward and that is what he's doing here He's directionally going the correct way. He went to his left. He turned around his right shoulder and now he's going to his left again So directionally that is appropriate This moment right here is a clear indication of which direction his hip is going. We see that his hips are pointing out to our right side of the screen, or his left side, also indicated by the angle in which his torso is at. But also at the same time, he's stepping with that same foot. He's stepping with his left foot. So, his hips shouldn't be going out to the left, they really should be going out to his right. And instead, his hips or his vertebrae would be tilted the opposite direction here. And this will be a repetitive correction. Every time he's stepping with his left foot, he's also moving his hips to the left, which is incorrect. It should be the opposite way his hips are going. And I won't continue to repeat this correction, but this is gonna be a correction that he should be applying throughout this basic bachata dance step. . We see here again the dancer stepping with his right foot. He's moving his hips to the right when they should be moving to his left and he is also tilting his head. We see this head tilt here which is not necessary because it's causing his spine to be on an angle and instead his spine should be in a perfectly vertically straight line. The only part of his spine that is moving any which way is should be his hips moving to the left. The dancer missed a count here. This was count eight, and on count eight, his right foot should have been tapping close into his left. Right now, he's already starting his next bachata dance step and stepping outward. He's a count early now. So it's count eight, his feet should be together. Instead, it's count eight and his feet are apart, which really shouldn't be happening to the next first count or count one of the next measure. So now from here on out, he's going to be off rhythm because he did not do a complete full revolution. He should have still turned on a full four counts. Just like any bachata step that he's doing here, it takes four counts. He's walking one, two, three, touching four. And even when he's turning around, he should be walking one, two, three, touching a four or turning on five, six, seven, touching eight. Either way, it's four counts, but here he does it only in three counts, which is gonna make him now off rhythm moving forward. The dancer sometimes looks with his eyes downward and this is not necessary. He can be focusing straight outward the entire time so that he doesn't change the alignment of his neck, which is the top of his spine. Instead, his spine would be perfectly aligned if his head remains stacked on top of his vertebrae and not looking downward. His head continues to look around in multiple directions which is not necessary and are extra movements through his neck that are a bit distracting. The dancer's hands are in fists and that way they're holding some tension and the dancer shouldn't be having fists or his hands in fists when he is executing this movement and in the way that he is moving his arms it's looking as if he's running or running a motor moving them forward and back or rowing a boat and really his arms should or his hands should be more relaxed not in a fist and be in front of him instead of at his sides as they are here. The dancers arm movement here again is awkward It's also extended out to his side and if he was to be down to the partner if that's what he is Practicing his arm movement should actually be or his arm positioning should be a little forward in front of him because the dancer and Or the other dancer like his partner would be linking arms with him and if his arm is extended directly out to the side his partner would have to reach all the way forward to be Holding it or grasping his hand So his hand needs to be a bit On the diagonal in front of him so that each partner would be extending their arms and equal distance and it would be a true Partnership right here his arm extended outward is not Correct, and it would be very difficult for any partner to be holding his hand and dancing with him The dancer did a good job of turning around from facing the back of the room to facing the front of the room and remaining in rhythm and going directionally the way he was supposed to. So he made this transition here smoothly and executed it correctly. When the dancer moves his arms upward like this it's a bit awkward because he doesn't have a partner that he is dancing with. This part would be a ghost partner as if they're not present. So perhaps he's practicing this arm movement as if he is turning a partner or holding their hand but because the partner is not there it's awkward and it's not meant to be practiced like that. It's also difficult for him to assess how high or low his arm should be because there is not a partner with a specific height that he is dancing with there. So this extra arm movement that he's doing right here is not necessary especially because he is dancing as a solo here. The dancer right now is dancing on rhythm, walking one, two, three to his left side and then bringing and touching his right foot into his left on count four, and then walking five, six, seven to his right side and touching his left foot into his right foot on count eight. So he's walking one, two, three, touch four, five, six, seven, touch eight, and this is in proper rhythm. The dancer also completes the right amount of steps when he turns around. He walks around in a circle three times and then taps his foot on the fourth count, which takes up the same amount of space as each of these bachata basic steps that he's doing. So he does the proper amount of foot steps on this turn. The only thing is he is a count behind in music still because of the mistake he made prior before when he turned around in a circle and instead of taking four steps he took five steps. So now he will perpetually be a count late in the music unless he perfects it and fixes it. The dancer is also now going to be directionally traveling to his left, which is incorrect. He should be traveling directionally to his right because right before he turned, he was traveling to his right, one, two, three, touch, four. And that turn that he did, which would have been a turn around his left shoulder, which is what he did, should have been five, six, seven, and touching in on eight. And that would be replacing him directionally moving to his left. So he moved to his right, one, two, three, touch, four, and turned around his left, going to the left, five, six, seven, touch, eight, which means he really should now be going to the right side of the room. Instead, he added this extra step in here where he stepped out on his right foot on eight and then touched his left foot in on one. So now he's going to be a count behind in the music, stepping out on two instead of stepping out on one with his left foot. And he's going to be traveling to his left, which is really not correct. He should be traveling to his right and being one count ahead of where he is now. The dancer's arms are twisting as he's going up and down, as if he's lifting weights. But instead, his arms shouldn't be turning from side to side. They should be in front of him and moving up and down and not twisting. So his arms are too far to the side of him, where they should be in front of his body and they should not be twisting at all. When the dancer is stepping with his foot, he's also rolling through his ribs and vertebrae a bit. And this is not necessary. Really, he just should be stepping and moving his hips horizontally to the other side. But his vertebrae should remain aligned and just upright. He doesn't need any of these extra superfluous movements that he's doing through his vertebrae when he's stepping. He's basically stepping and doing a bit of an overcurve, like moving his body through a wave, but he doesn't need to do that at all. Again, the dancer here is looking downward. His eyes are focused downward. Not necessary. His eyes should be focused outward, straightforward. And here the dancer is stepping with his right foot and his hips are pulling to his right, but again it should be the opposite direction. So instead when he's stepping with his right foot as he is here, his hips should be pulling away towards his left. The dancer also sticks out his neck. He's moving his head forward here when he's turning. So he's scrunched up at his neck and then his head is tilting backwards a bit. And this poking out of the neck and extension of the cervical vertebrae, meaning that his spine, the top of his spine, his neck backwards, makes his body not aligned. So we see here his spine is hunching forward, his neck is moving outward, or his chin is moving outward, and then his neck is on an arch backwards. So he's creating this angle in his spine that is a bit zigzagged. And instead, his spine really should be in a straight line. The dancer is not moving his hips properly or directionally correct. So when he's stepping with his left foot, his hips should actually be pulling to the right. Right here he's pulling them to his left. So his hips should be pulling in the opposite direction in which he steps.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Again, you want to catch and shoot. You got to be very aggressive because of defense, but love that his feet are apart. I love that he's going straight up. Great lift of the ball up. And again, it may be a little bit to the right of his head. It's not too bad. And let's get that shooting elbow in under the ball. Looks like it's a little bit out. But beautiful extension, he's got beautiful technique and form on the release. Great extension, great flexion, snapping of the wrists, fingers point down, guide hand on the side, beautiful extension of the hips. But I know, I know he can jump higher. Again, standing straight up, waiting for the pass. Let's step in and meet this pass. I love that left-right, one-two step, meet the pass, get those hands and arms out ready to catch and shoot. Again, brings the ball down really low. Let's keep it up high. Here I love how he's got his feet apart, one foot in front of the other. But he's just really counting on just being able to jump from a standstill position. It'd be better if you're moving and stepping into that pass to get power to lift. But as he raises it, it's not too bad. I'd get these elbows in a little bit, but beautiful extension of the hips. He's going up on the balls of his feet. You can see the ball sitting on the palm of his hand softly, which is good. And, you know, that elbow looks like it's out a little bit. Let's bring it under the ball right here. Again, let's meet this pass. The reason you want to do this so a defender doesn't step between you and the ball and steal it. So let's step in. Let's step left, right and catch this ball. Catch and shoot. Again, in this view, great extension of the shooting elbow. It's high. Let's keep it there. Great flexion of the wrist. Fingers go down. Guide hand stays on the side. Again, let's bring that guide elbow in so it's 90 degree. Again, he raises the ball high. That's beautiful, great 90-degree angle of the shooting arm. I'd get that elbow in a little bit here. But he starts to elevate straight up. He got the ball up high, which is really good. It's hard to block that shot. A little bit, maybe, some people say he may be bringing it back a little bit beyond his forehead, but I think that looks really good. Here, we'd love more elevation, use of the legs on this shot, good extension of the shooting arm, snapping of the wrists, guide hands on the side, let's get that elbow in. It's pretty good though, not bad. Again, ideally, I'd be really stepping aggressively into this pass. He sort of just waits for it to come to him, sort of like aggressively stepping one, two, plant, catch, and shoot. He's straight up, waits for the ball to come to him. Again, in a game situation, it's going to be a turnover because a defense is going to run right in front of you and steal it. So meet your pass. It's ideally recommended that you practice that in this drill. Again, beautiful flexion here, extension of the shooting arm. You can see this guide hand elbow go out. Let's bring it down underneath or bring it in. Just bring it in so it's underneath the hand. Great extension of the hips. Here in this mid-range jumper, in that egocentric view, beautiful extension of the shooting arm, which is his right arm and hand. Love the snapping of the wrist and the fingers are down as the ball leaves his hand. Shooting palm or the non-shooting guide hand, that palm is facing in. I might bring this elbow down a little bit so it's pointing more to the ground. You can see that it's kind of pointing out. So let's just bring this elbow in a little bit. But love the hand placement here of the guide hand. Pretty good lift. I feel like he could get more lift if he would kind of step into this pass, one, two, catch and shoot. But a good extension here. A nice touch. Here, you know, just takes his time, brings it down low, steps back. So, you know, I just would recommend just, you know, this is a skill where you just can work on your footwork and catching and shooting and elevating. Again, on the release, let's hold the follow-through up, come down balanced, low, cushion your fall with bent knees and on the balls of your feet. Follow through, I would, you know, I would recommend that he holds his follow through, that he brings both arms down. Let's hold it up there until it hits the rim. Again, come down, be balanced, knees bent, hold that follow through, extend that shooting arm, guide hand. Again, that right elbow is kind of moving to the outside. Let's get it under. Get that follow through straight to the face in the basketball. Again, beautiful guide hand. Let's get that elbow in. Here, he catches it, you kind of see his feet are just kind of, you know, not, I would have that, you know, that left step with that left foot and pull the right leg in, but on top of the footwork, he kind of drops the ball, if you will, he kind of brings it down low instead of keeping it up high. Like he needs to keep it up high and take it right into his shot. Again, I really feel like as he's waiting for this pass, he's kind of standing straight up to make it more game-like and real-like. He needs to be down in a ready position, I call it, with his shooting hand ready to catch and shoot. Here, he's straight up, feet are together, not ready to receive a catch and shoot. My recommendation, if that's what we're looking for.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So in this position we can see that they are hanging on with their right hand with the right arm in a very straight position which is a really good thing to see. And then with that they're also using the left foot which is going to be the opposite point of contact compared to their right hand and with that that does help to stabilize the body between those two points. So this is a really good position to see from the climber to start this climb. And then what we can see happening here is we can see the climbers kind of rotating their body so that the left side of the hip kind of starts to go up towards the wall and the reason for that is it helps to bring up that left hand that they're trying to get into the position. So this is a really good thing to see from the climber to start their climb. And so here we can see the climber was able to switch their feet, so now their right foot is on the foothold right here. And one of the key important things about that is that it does allow the climber to rotate their body so that their right side of the body gets closer to the wall. And one of the main reasons why this is important is because now they want to transfer the bodyweight directly underneath their left arm, so then that way they can have a better control of the position on that left arm, and then this way their right hand has an opportunity to move into the next position. So this is pretty good to see from the climber that they were able to rotate around that right foot to try and get in a better position to complete the next move.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She executes this movement very particularly and meticulously when she's reaching her hands to her head and her hips, alternating right and left. She does this very clearly. She does not add any extra steps in this or any directions that would be unclear. Her hands go directly to her head and her waist and switch directly other hand to her head and her waist. The dancer is swiveling her hips greatly here, that's showing a lot of stylistic elements and that's wonderful. The dancer just did an amazing job changing level from a high level to a medium level by bending her knees greatly. She had her head reached down to where her knees was. This was a sudden change that she executed wonderfully, especially because she initiated that drop down from her head. So by moving her head quickly down like that, her upper body followed, you know, her neck, her shoulders, her chest then followed downward. And this was a great change of level. The dancer's spot again is excellent. She's doing a full revolution around and she's able to do that quickly because her eyes are spotting exactly forward where she wants to end that turn. The dancer executed this turn seamlessly she completed one and a quarter one and a half revolutions where she started Facing the left side of the room and then rotate it all the way around back to the left side and then back further forward So I was about one and a quarter revolutions and she was able to do that So seamlessly so swiftly because she placed her weight onto her toes She lifted her heels when she was turning which didn't cause her any Friction that would stop her there were no boundaries or barriers to stop the momentum of her turn and she also used her eyes To spot the front of the room, which is where this turn is ending So between what she's doing with her eyes in her head and what she's doing with her weight on her toes She's able to execute this turn wonderfully In this opening position that the dancer is executing, it can be improved if her front foot is on a higher arch, meaning that she's standing on tippy toes. But if she was to further her tippy toe position by moving her weight higher up onto the ball of her foot with her heel higher up off the ground, that would help. And also what would help is if her heel was reaching further in alignment over her big toe. Right now her heel is kind of leaning a bit towards her pinky toe, so if she really concentrated on putting the weight of her foot into the metatarsals and the undering of her big toe instead of her pinky toe, that would help her remain balanced in this position and would be an aesthetically aligned position. The dancer finishes strongly in a pose. She is frozen and we know the dance is done because she is not moving. She is also freezing with energy. So even though she's stationary, not moving, the energy is coming all the way down out of the tips of her toes and all the way up out of the tips of her hands. Her energy in her head is also pulling straight upward. So she has energy in her legs on the diagonals, downward diagonals, energy in her arms and the upward diagonals and energy from her head straight upward. Her hips are moving easily, they're moving smoothly, and she's basically gliding across the floor because she's pressing her weight onto her toes, which is allowing her hips to have this movement back and forth, and for her to glide from feet together to her leg out like this, and she's gonna cross it back forward, mostly because she's able to maintain her weight towards her toes. She is able to move her arms quickly to different positions because she is not tensing her arms. Rather, she's loosening her body so that her arms can swing sideways up and down with ease. And this is happening because she is not tense. If she was to be tense, her whole body would be stiff, and she wouldn't be able to move this quickly to multiple positions as she is currently doing. The dancer is able to change direction here so quickly, moving her feet and different patterning across the floor because she is relying her weight on her toes and her heels are constantly lifted. We see here in this frozen frame that her heels are off the ground, her feet are actually at an angle because she is standing more so on her toes. The dancer is able to execute this backbend step with great energy and very quickly because she straightens her arm that is resting on the floor. So her hand and palm of her left hand is flat on the floor and she's pushing upward to straighten that arm and how she's also able to do that is pushing her back up as a means of pushing her hips to the ceiling. So because her hips are pushing to the ceiling that is helping her arm also straighten upwards towards the ceiling. The dancer is able to get down to this floor position without hurting herself, without injuring herself, because she rotates her knee to face the front. At first, she gets low by bending her legs. She then changes her knee position from facing the floor to facing forward. That way, she can sit down on her side of her thigh. And she's also using her left hand as a foundation, as a root in the ground, so that she can get into that position without any banging around on the floor in a way that's very neat and very consolidated. When her arms are punching downward like this, she could do a better job of being meticulous so that we can tell if the choreography is meant for her to have straight arms, slightly arced arms, bent arms, but it's not really clear if her arms are supposed to be straight down or at an angle because they're in an in-between territory where her arms are slightly bent and kind of in a circular arc and not exactly straight. Again, the dancer drops down with great energy going from a standing position to this bent low position. She's able to do this well. She's bending her knees and really pushing her entire weight downward, changing her center of gravity by really having this wide stance in her legs, which is helping her remain balanced and change that level quickly. That's wonderful. The dancer does a good job in extending her arm completely straight outward. We see even her pointer finger is pointing diagonal into that front left corner of the room. What would make this step even better, especially as an opening step of a dance routine, is if she also extended this movement with energy from her shoulder outward, as if she's yearning for that corner or reaching as far as she possibly could. So her arm is technically correct in that it is straight, but from an artistry standpoint or a stylist standpoint, it could be even better if she was to extend outward from her shoulder forward as well, as if she's desperately trying to reach something in that corner. Her arms do a great job of pushing forward and outward, especially we see that she's holding her hands in fists. She's making this energy tight so when she's pushing forwards and outward the direction is clear and with much force. The dancer does a great job of bursting her energy upward. Here she's creating a V with her arms and this is a perfect angle, this is perfect execution. She has energy coming out of her fingertips. We could feel and see it emitting on these diagonals. Something that would help make this movement even better is that if she maintained her balance slightly more and she could do this by closing her rib cage. Right now her ribs are exposed as her chest is leaning forward or pushing forward. But if she was to wrap her rib cage inward to close her rib cage towards her belly button, this would help her remain standing tall without losing her balance. All of the dancers and movements are very sharp. They're linear. There's no question about where she is in space, where her arms are aiming or what direction she is facing. She's dancing very clearly. The dancer does a wonderful job of leaning backwards in this step where she's looking upwards. Her arms are going outwards on a diagonal, so diagonally upward and out, and her chest is facing upwards as well. Her head is leaned backwards, her neck is exposed, and leaning backwards like this is giving her more room to lift her leg higher and her leg is leading or leading up into the air with ease because she's creating space for it by leaning backwards. The dancer is punching upwards with great energy and we see this well in her hands and fists and also her knee is mimicking her arms or her fists. Her arms are punching upward with great energy and her knee and her leg is doing the exact same thing. A minor note for styling, the dancer could drop further down here in level so she could bend her knees even more so that her whole position, her whole body would be lower in space which would show a more dynamic shift in level from when she was standing up tall and high to now this middle level position where she's bending her knees. The dancer shimmying her shoulders with great energy and style. When the dancer is circling her right arm around counterclockwise over her head, she is doing this well, but the step could be even better if she was to straighten her arm all the way right here. Her elbow is slightly bent, and if she's also aware of her wrist, making sure she's not bending at the wrist too much. Right here, her wrist is bent so that her line breaks, and her wrist being bent is making her fingers point outward instead of extending from that line further upward.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And with his arm being straight as he swings backwards and continues to swing back, it's going to just act as a bigger lever and it's going to leave all this room for his feet to swing out and his whole hips to kind of come further and further from the wall, sending all of his weight flying away from the wall. So it starts in a pretty good position. His arms are nice and straight. The dino up to this green hold. So his movement here is gonna be pulling himself as close to the wall. And when his hips are as close to the wall, then jumping up to the dino. So by not bending his arms, that's pretty good. So he should be able to kind of pendulum up, give himself a couple of practice swings, get his hips close to the wall, and then jump. He does something kind of funny. He's kind of twisting his right knee in, which when he kind of practices, it kind of sends him out a little bit. So we can see that as he's jumping out, as he's jumping up, that knee twist isn't really bringing his hip closer to the wall. It's kind of sending him off at this kind of angle. So when he jumps out, he's going to be kind of shooting outward from the wall as he moves upwards. And so he won't be as close to the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Here I would tell them to drop their weight and their pelvis even further in the ground as they move their legs in and out. That would create a more different level of variations, which again creates more dynamic quality within the movement, which dynamics make it very interesting to watch it is. I would encourage this dancer, they have really great energy throughout their extremities, but they're missing their center. So they're not rotating that rib cage, they're not rotating those hips, right? And by doing that, it makes it feel stiff, even though they're doing all this amazing work. So embodiment from not only just the extremities, but from head to toe and through your center is super important. I would encourage the dancer to roll their shoulders forward, up and back right now. Their shoulders look hunched up to their ears. I would encourage the dancer to be very precise about where they place their arms. It looks like they're doing a little bit of a heel toe at this moment before, so making sure they know when to be on their heels versus when to be on their ball to the feet, that kind of attention to detail and advanced choreography takes it to the next level. I would encourage the dancer to send their hips back even further, but again, open up their chest so they can be grounded, right, and be able to move really quickly and have this great range of motion, which we see with this dancer. But then they're also able to exude confidence and have this rib cage articulation here.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I would also encourage the dancer again to plie or to bend their knees to be more grounded in this movement So it flows and it looks a little less awkward So the grounding motion will help that and help the flow throughout the body I would encourage the dancer to just take a half a second before they start this side step. They're a little bit off of the music, so taking that moment to just breathe and ground themselves before they start this side step will be extremely helpful to make sure that they're on the beat. This dancer does a really great job of having like really sharp and staccato movements. I would encourage them to think about how they can be more energetic in their movement and also be overly dramatic while they take up space. This would give more dynamic quality to this already really great sharp and staccato movements that we're seeing. I would encourage the dancer to really think about their neck in this and the alignment of it to make sure that their shoulders are either erect and their neck is sitting right on top of these shoulders. And I will also to encourage them to roll these shoulders up, back, up, back, and down, up, back, and down so they have a more wide open chest and wide open base to work from. This would encourage the dancer's dynamic quality and also give the illusion that they're taking up more space throughout the dance. I would encourage the dancer to sink a little bit deeper into their plie and engage their hips in a circular motion, not just kind of the right now they're kind of going side to side back and forth. This would give them more dynamic quality.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The music is playing very low, so it's difficult to hear. However, from what I do hear, she's not dancing in rhythm with that music. She's dancing a lot slower than that music. The dancers need to be pulling in oppositional directions more. So although the dancers are far apart here in width, which is good, the dancer in the pink should be pulling further backwards so that their arms are really taut in how they're linking. The dancer is doing a good job of meeting her feet on the triple step. So when she came forward to the front left diagonal of the screen, she moved her right foot, then her left foot, then her right foot again, three steps, triple step, or one, two, three. And in that second step, her left foot met her right foot in the center. The dancer's arm is a bit bent when she is spinning and she can extend more from the elbow higher. The dancer's eye focus is very good. She's looking in the direction of where her body is opening and facing. So when her body is facing to her left, she's also looking in that direction and looking towards her arms that she's extending as well. The dancer is also standing in a nice wide stance here, which is allowing her more mobility in her upper body because she is stable in her lower body. The dancer is doing a good job of making eye contact with her partner. Her partner's face is clearly in her line of vision. She's staring straight ahead at him. The dancer extends her arms well when she moves them away from her center. She is extending them in straight lines. The dancers are mirroring each other while so when the dancer in the pink uses her right foot, the dancer in the black uses his left foot. They're facing each other with their bodies angled towards each other's shoulders angled towards each other, hips angled towards each other and their feet are mirroring each other. However, now that the dancer is moving to a greater extent, she's looking downward. The dancer's lower body is in her view. The majority or the rest of his face isn't in her view anymore. So she needs to raise her focus. Her chin should be parallel to the floor instead of pointed at an angle downward. And she should still be looking at her partner who is straight in front of her.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This is the most efficient way of undoing a foot switch because the climber is first applying pressure to the left toe coming into the hold before releasing the left foot from its place. The climber dropping the right toe had applied significant pressure onto the left foot as well as the grips. So quickly the climber has glanced down at the wall to bring the right toe to come into place at a new stance bringing it as a high foot placement where the climber places a toe over the edge of the hold. Once the climber is able to create pressure then we'll be able to release one of the limbs to the next move. For a second the climber in swinging the right foot out, the left toe kind of lost pressure. This is because of the way that the climber placed the foot immediately onto the hold and has adjusted by smearing the foot into the hole to secure the foot placement. We can see how the left toe placement helped the climber to gain direction when performing the reach. As we can see the climber is placing the toe and pushes it over to the left direction and down so that she was able to send the right hand over to the jug. Right now the climber is repositioning the right hand to gain more height by placing the hand above the hold. In doing so the climber first brought the right knee to come inwards to bring the right side of the body towards the wall to help the reach. At this moment the climber is sustaining to positive grips this one because the climber is able to wrap the fingers around the lip of the hold And now it's glancing down to perform a foot switch where she's bringing the left toe to come into place where the right toe is however, the way and technique that the climber is Performing the foot switch is called the jumping off and jumping on So the climber jumps the toe off the lip of the hold before Bringing into place the left toe and then the left toe comes to jump over the hold to apply pressure immediately This is one that is most commonly done across climbers, but also Mostly done by newer climbers who are introduced to the sport. This is because the foot switch does work This method but it's not the most accurate placement especially if done on the small holds. In this case, this is a large lip on the hold so it's hard to miss And they can take a fair bit of energy when doing this method The climber in keeping the right leg extended with the toe tapped against the wall forces the climber to have a twist of the body over to the left side which helps the climber when making the reach. The climber had just made the right foot placement and on almost performing the next move, her right toe has popped out from place. It's important that the climber always apply sufficient pressure onto the toe placement before performing the move, but due to this slip, the climber is now engaging on the arms to do a quick pull-up to pick up her weight and engaging onto the core to recover the move, as she is glancing down again at the feet to reposition a new foot placement. As we can see the climber was able to release the right foot from its foot placement, having the leg extended. This is called flagging out, so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place, and was able to transfer the left hand over to the next hold at reach. This one being a small jug with a lip where the climber can place the fingertips behind the lip of the hold. Because the climber is sending the right hand to the holder at reach, she needed to adjust due to the first placement of the hand not being the most accurate one. So the climber engages into another pull up to release some pressure at the grip to reposition the right hand grip. The climber sends the right toe to come back onto the wall to have the leg extended. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer the weight to the left foot being in place. And dropping the foot helps the climber to drop the weight onto the grips once the climber brings the hands over to a match at the last hold. The climber must sustain the match with control and stability over her body position as well as when performing the match in order to complete the climb. The climber glances down at the feet and performs a jump off jump on placement of foot switch technique. This one seemed to work even though it was placed on a small foothold. And the climber, in order to gain accuracy over the placement, the climber is glancing down at the feet. So for a split second, the climber's feet are not in contact with the hold during the process. And this can take a fair bit of energy when being performed in a small hold. However, the climber was able to secure and take the risk of this foot placement because she's hanging on to solid grips. The climber was able to take advantage of the momentum when the climber was bringing the center of gravity over to the right foot and releasing the right hand to immediately make the placement of the fingers going into the hold. Now the climber once gets to curl the fingers and applying pressure to the lip of the hold then the climber will be able to gain a stability on the move. The climber was able to send the right hand over to the next hold at reach. She first had extended the arms over the grips that she was sustaining down below to lower her center of gravity, then to quickly use momentum to pull herself on a forceful pull-up to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place and pulled down in order to gain height for the reach. The climber continues to apply pressure at the feet when transferring over the left hand over too much at the jug. And it's important that the climber eventually brings her center of gravity over to the right foot, newly into place as the climber is continuing the direction of the route to the right. The climbers are starting at a one-hold start where she places both of the hands on top of the lip of the hold. This is called matching and has placed the right toe to come into place over a hold to extend the left leg as the left toe is not placed onto the wall and is to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. Now the climber keeping the arms extended is to transfer over the weight to the grips and not standing onto the mat anymore than the climb has started. Once the climber has secured the right hand grip on a more sustainable area for the grip, this one being above the hold and not to the side, this one because the climber would have to press on the direction opposite from the opening of the hold which would have had the climber engage more force onto the arm by pointing the elbow out. But it was good of the climber to bring the hand farther up to secure the grip as the climber is able to extend the arm. This will allow the climber to gain recovery time on the arm muscles since it is not engaged and the climber is only engaging on the grip. Once the climber was able to secure the grip, we can see how she was able to transfer over the weight and releases the right foot from its place to transfer over the weight to the three areas of contact. The climber now glances down at the feet because she is making a new foot placement. It's important that the climber knows exactly in what area of the hold she will be pressing the toe onto. Eventually the left toe will help the climber to be pushed over that direction at reach. The climber was able to bring the right toe at a high foot placement. This is a large hold with a lip that is sustainable for her toe placement. Once the climber was able to apply the toe over the lip, she now presses it down and was able to transfer over the right hand over to the next hold. She is gaining height while sustaining on the grips, reason why the climber has released the left foot from its place to transfer over the weight to the highest foot. As the climber releases the left toe from its further placement, the climber is right now balancing over her areas of support as she releases the right hand to bring it over to the last hold. As soon as the climber was able to recover, had placed the left toe onto the foot chip and quickly has engaged into a quick standing up by pushing onto the left toe to gain height to bring her left hand over to the hold at reach. As we can see the right leg being extended, this is called flagging out and the climber had tapped the toe against the wall so that she can stay in position on bringing her hips close to the wall when performing the reach. It's important the climber always glances down at the feet to reposition the feet or when making a foot switch to make sure that the position of the toe coming to place at the foot chip is accurate. As the climber will need to rely on the foot placements for the stance when performing the next move.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

With the ball placed here on the backboard, she would need to create side spin on the ball for the ball to spin off of the backboard and go into the basket. On the release of the shot she was able to create the necessary side spin so once it hit this location on the backboard it spin off of the backboard and went directly into the basket. After she makes the layup and the ball goes through the basket, she allows the ball to bounce and hit the ground. This is due to her being so far away from the basket that she's unable to catch the ball as it comes through the net. When we're doing the mic and drill, we want to make sure we want to make sure that the ball never hits the ground and after every time we make the layup, we're in position to catch the ball as it comes through the net and then we can as we catch the ball, we can immediately go up on the opposite side of the basket and shoot the ball. The player here is demonstrating the Mike and Drew where you jump off of two feet. And you can see, take a look at the positioning of the ball in her arm. She does a good job of extending the ball out away from her body and having her hand underneath the ball. With her arm extended out in this fashion and the positioning of her hand underneath the ball, this allows for her to create a side spin on the ball as she shoots the ball off of the backboard. The side spin that she created with the release will be able to spin the ball off of the backboard and go into the basket. However, looking at her positioning on the floor, we can see that she is not underneath the basket. When we are doing the Mike and Drew, we want to make sure that we are positioning ourselves underneath the basket and not so far out in front of the basket. So her positioning on the floor is incorrect. And because she is so far out from the basket, it is going to be very difficult for her to perform the drill correctly. Due to the player being in the incorrect position on the floor, as she releases the shot from her hand, she hits the bottom of the rim and she misses the shot because where she released the ball from isn't the best position on the floor to shoot the layup during a mic and drill. This is why it's important for us to use the proper footwork during the mic and drill as when we use the correct footwork, it will place us in the best positions on the floor in order to make the layup as easy as possible. And while we're doing the mic and drill, we always want to put ourselves in the best position to make the layup that we're attempting as easy as possible. As she shoots the ball with her right hand on the right side of the basket, she does not take any steps, so she's not using any footwork for the Mike and Drew. When we're going to the right side of the basket, we want to take our first step with our left foot to the right side of the basket, and then we're swinging our right foot into position to square ourselves up. So we'll have our right foot here and our left foot here, and then once we're in this position here, we jump up and shoot the ball with our right hand off of the backboard and into the basket. As she is going to shoot the ball with her left hand on the left side of the basket, she steps with her outside foot, which is her left foot. When we're doing a Mike & Drew and we're going to the left side of the basket, we want to take the first step with our right foot to the left side of the basket. So her right foot should be positioned here for step one, and then she'll swing her left foot into position here for step two, and then shoot the ball with her left hand off of the backboard and into the basket.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They have a lot of nice clarity in this moment and consistency when performing this movement.

As the dancer begins to do a basic step touch or a side-to-side movement with their partner, they appear to be connected to the rhythm and have an understanding of the movement vocabulary. They're able to effectively use their feet primarily to stay connected to the rhythm, while using their arms to stay connected physically to their partner. As the dancer transitions through a few different steps that locomote him and his partner through the space, he again struggles to find consistency in his footwork. He's able to go in and out of being connected to the rhythm, however, he's really inconsistent in the clarity as well as the rhythmic embodiment. As the dancer performs a kind of a stylized walk moving forward in the space holding their partner with one arm, they really start to reconnect to the rhythm here.

Looking at the player going into his right-handed mic and layup attempt on the right frame, an improvement the player can make is staying low with his body placement position and the athletic stance.

This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. Also, having the leg extended is so the climber is able to gain a civility and balance over the move. In this moment to keep her left side close to the wall as she is releasing some of the pressure up out of her right hand grip. Now with the right hand we can see the climber placing the fingers flat on the top area of the hold. With the thumb wrapped around it helps the climber to sort of create a pinch as she's folding her hand onto the knuckles trying to bring the palm close to the hold. Now the climber what she's doing is trying to engage as much skin over the hold to create friction as she will need to create eventually pressure on her open hand grip and try to close it to sustain the grip. The climbers is starting at one hold start where she places both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching and she's sustaining to the lip of the hold where it indents in and the climber is able to curl the fingers behind the lip of the hold. This one being a jug the climber is able to add extra support into the grip by pinching it using the thumbs from underneath to squeeze the hold. Once the climber got to secure the grips she's able to lean back to transfer the weight to the grips and brought the left toe to come into place much lower than the right foot that is placed at a distance. The climber releasing the right foot, she needs to continue to apply pressure onto the left foot placement. It could be potentially that the climber did not place accurately the toe over the hold or the climber did not give it sufficient pressure onto the hold. So it's important that the climber brings the toe as far in towards the wall and places the toe above the foot chip. This one being as small, if the climber places it too much out away from the foothold because the foothold might be rounded, then she wouldn't have much surface of the foot meeting with the hold, resulting potentially for the slip. The climber releasing the right foot to bring it over to the next placement after placing the left foot. The left foot has slipped out from the hold. Now both of the feet had come in contact with the ground ending the climb. The climber is placing her hands inside of the chalk bag. This is to cover her hands with the powder that will help her gain a better grip when sustaining to the holds when at the climb as well as absorbing any moisture that may be built up at her hands. The climber had dropped the left foot this way so the climber was able to load most of her weight onto the grip and find the right position on the adjustment before bringing the left foot back into its place where she would then release pressure as she would not be loading it completely. Also, she's bringing the left foot to come into position so that she's able to release the right foot from its place as next the climber will need to transfer the left hand to the next move. The climber here engages immediately on an efficient move where she pushes down into the feet to raise the hips and that way throw her shoulder up rotating her top area of the torso to send the right hand to come into place onto the next hold it reach.

She had sent the left hand over to be placed as an undercling on the other side of the hold, this one on both sides being a jug, but instead brings the left hand to come into join onto the same side where the right hand is. The climber performing the dynamic move, it would be really hard for her to recover if not making the hand placement. This is because the climber was already standing over the right foot, the only one being in place in the left hand. Due to not making the reach, the climber then now will be brought down due to her center of gravity being thrown off. The climber in applying the toe to apply pressure over the hold, she was struggling and create that pressure. This is because the climber is leaning over to the right side making it really hard for the climber to sustain pressure onto the left foot as most of the weight is transferred over to the right foot being in place. Right now the climber is bringing her center of gravity low to keep her feet above her hips. This is because the climber right now is glancing at the hold reach where she will need to perform a dynamic move. Once the climber was able to transfer over the weight to the right hand grip, after securing it, she is bringing now the left foot that was out and extend it to come over to a high foot placement, coming to a match where the left hand is. As we can see, the climber sends the heel into the wall and is placing the outer area of the heel towards the hold. This is called a heel hook and the climber is placing the heel hook as one of the foot techniques that helps the climber to keep her center of gravity close to the wall. This is a strong foot placement as the climber could be working on a series of moves or one big move while keeping the heel in place. The climber is glancing over to bring the right foot at a high foot placement due to the next hold being at reach to the right side. So the climber brings the right foot at a high foot placement over the flat surface of the hold. This one almost plays by the lip since it is slightly curved in and it will be more positive for the climber to apply the sole of the foot on the toe area towards the hold. The climber needs to try to place the shoe above the surface of the hold and create significant pressure onto the right foot placement in order to stick the rubber to the pores of the hold. Here we can see the climber has gain height and stand up over her feet being in place while pulling her right hand a Grip towards her by bringing the elbow close to the core in order to send the left hand over to the next hold at reach Now the weight of the climber is sustaining to the top hold. She's sending The hand over as a hook to apply the skin over the open grip this one is a Handle that is thick so the climber brings the fingers far in into the hold in order To apply pressure and secure the grip The climber was able to remove the right toe from its place down below and statically send the right toe to a high foot placement. The clamboran making a move over her mean areas of support with the left extended and Continue to do one extra move. This is called bumping and she has moved the hand to come up further Because it has a more secure grip lending the hand onto a jug The climber is glancing over at the hold at reach and even if she had placed the right foot to come into surface at the hold previously, she instead has brought over the right toe to come into place where the left toe was to release the left toe from its place. Now the left leg extended. This is called flagging out so it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. The climber is starting at a one-hold start where she places both of the hands onto the hold. This is called matching and the climber places the palms facing up towards the lip of the hold. As we can see this type of hand placement is called an undercling where the climber gets to slide the fingers behind the lip of the hold and can use the thumbs above the hold in order to secure the grip by pinching onto the hold meaning squeezing. Now in order for the climber to support the grips she will have to pull herself in or pull the hold towards her bringing the elbows close to the core to sustain the grips. Now the climber is standing on the mat and once the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing in the mat then the climb will start. The climber in order to perform a dynamic move she needed to jump over her feet and in this case the climber Lack height to place the hand over the hold This is because the climber was focusing on applying pressure onto the left foot placement Which she was struggling to apply and that distracted the climber from applying Most pressure onto the right foot placement reason why the climber wasn't able to perform the jump with sufficient height Heel hooks can be tricky to release because they provide a lot of force and in this case the climber chose to stay into one side of the hole matching the grips to transfer the weight over to the right side as a climber then engaged into a quick pull in with her heel being engaged to then release it to quickly place the toe above the hold The climber was able to send the right hand over to the next hold at reach and having the left leg extended helps a climber to keep balance over her areas of support. The leg extended, this is called flagging out. As we can see the climber was able to bring the right hand over to a match at the hold and this one is placed underneath the handle where she places it as an under cling. This is when the climber is placing the hand from underneath and in order to create pressure and secure the grip the climber places the fingers far in and to the handle in order to squeeze the hold and Once the climber securing the grips she's able to bring the left foot at a high foot placement and is glancing over to the next hold at reach It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet to make sure that she applies accurate placement. This one because the climber eventually will have to stand up to gain height to perform the next hold at reach.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You want that shoulder to face more in this way compared to going out that way. It eliminates the ability to miss, it will make you more efficient in your accuracy, and it also will prevent the defender from being able to block your shot. You can see his shoulder is probably more going that way where he would want it to come more turned in this way, creating a better angle for the layup. The player starts out with a good base, feet shoulder width apart. You want to do that so you maintain good balance. You're able to get explosion with the left or the right foot. So that's why you want to have good balance and good footwork, shoulder width apart. As you can see right here. The player also does a great job of having both hands on the basketball. That secures possession against any defender trying to slap it away. Another area to note is he's not bending his knees enough as you can see and he's not getting off the ground enough. You really want to explode vertically, straight up and down to get the most explosive layup that you can possibly get. The closer you get to the basket, the more efficient you will be in your layup attempt. One area of improvement, as you can see, he needs to turn his shoulder into the rim right here. You want to turn more so that you can have a better angle to finish the layup accurately each time. So as you're attempting that layup, you want to turn your shoulder inward towards the rim instead of having it flat or outward. It gives you a better angle and it gives you more accuracy in finishing the layup.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

At every time, every shot, you're going to always see what's in front of you. That's a great job stepping into a shot, one, two step, getting his rhythm. Also, another thing, you start here, but you finish there. You want to stay stationary, finish forward versus left, right, or backwards. Right here, kind of a wide base here, so you want to be consistent there. But everything else is pretty good. The avoid flex there with the L shape. Almost seemed like he could have obstructed his vision here, but I didn't catch it in time. But you want to make sure if he did, just shift that ball a little bit to the right or bring it up over the right. Right here, picture perfect, straight up and down. Right feet still together. That's how you want it to be for balance purposes. Enough is said here. Open hand, pop that follow through. This is a great job, shoulder width apart, flexion in his knees. Got the L in his elbow, got the offhand here. I would say the ball is already in his hands, right? So his knees should already be bent. That way you don't have to catch the ball, then go down. If you're already down by the time the ball hits your hand, you're ready to elevate into your jump shot. So just kind of being ready to shoot when the ball hits your hand is ideally how you want to be versus moving as the ball is kind of placing in your hand. Picture perfect and it open, wrist is broken, followed through is there. This is a no-no. Finish the way you start. Both feet together, whereas this foot is already knee is bent and starting to go backwards, which is putting unnecessary pressure on his right leg.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Also bring in the player's shooting hand inside his body's frame, allowing his elbow to form an L-shape, aligning it towards the front of the rim, creating a more accurate alignment to guide the ball. On the release of the player's jump shot attempt on the left frame, we can notice that the player's follow through is being drifted towards the right side of the rim, which will allow the ball to go towards that direction. We will want the player to keep his follow through aligned towards the front of the rim to allow the ball to be guided accurately in the right alignment to get above the rim, creating the proper angle it needs to drop through the net. A few adjustments the player can make as we look on the right frame on his release is again have the player lift off the ground to allow the ball more accuracy, arc, and power to be guided properly above the rim creating an accurate angle of dropping inside the rim. As we look on the release of the player's jump, shot, attempt on the right frame, we can notice that again, we would want the player to jump on his release, allowing the ball to gain more arc, accuracy, and power it needs to get above the rim to have the opportunity of dropping through the net. This will allow the player to have more balance and lift on his jump shot, creating more arc and power to guide the ball above the rim. As we look on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player does a solid job on his attempted jump shot of having his follow through hand go downward in the direction of our target, allowing the ball to have the opportunity of staying in the correct alignment. As we look on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player is followed through. Momentum is guiding it towards the right side of the rim. This does not allow the ball to go in the right alignment it needs. Instead, allowing it to be drifted towards the right side, resulting in an incomplete jump shot attempt. On the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player does a solid job of getting his hand underneath the ball. A slight improvement we will want to make is to create a gap between the ball and the palm, having the ball rested on his fingertips, allowing a better release, creating more control, power, and alignment to help guide the ball above the rim, to be able to come down in the proper angle it needs, resulting in the completed jump shot attempt. As we look at the player go into his shooting motion on the right side of the frame, we can notice that since the player switched his shooting hand, he will now have to incorporate the correct footwork by stepping initially with his left foot first, and then having his right foot come down, going into his shooting motion. As we look at the release of the player's jump shot attempt on the right frame, a few improvements the player can make as we look at his follow-through is keeping it above his shoulder, aligned in front of his face, to be directed towards the front of the rim. We also can notice on the left frame that the player's follow-through is again drifting towards the right side of the rim, which allows the ball to do the same. We want the player to keep his follow-through in the alignment of the front of the rim to allow the ball to have a better opportunity of being directed accurately. Above the rim, creating the proper angle it needs to drop inside the rim. As we look at the player go into his shooting motion on the right side of the frame, some improvements the player can make to become more efficient on his jump shot attempts is to have his feet a little bit wider to allow more balance and control on the release of the jump shot. Also is to bring the player's elbow inside his body allowing his elbow to be more aligned towards the front of the rim to create and guide the ball into the right alignment allowing it a better opportunity of getting above the rim to create the proper angle of dropping through the rim. As the player is going into his jump shot attempt on the right frame again to help the player improve on his efficiency we want the player to Spread his legs a little bit wider to allow more balance and control on the release Also bring the players elbow inside his body frame Aligning it Towards the front of the rim We also want the player to implement the correct footwork By stepping initially With his right foot first and then secondly with his left foot going into his shooting motion Thank you for watching! As we look on the release of the player's jump shot attempt on the left frame, we can notice that the player does a good job of having his follow through come downward towards the target, which is going to be the middle point between the rim, allowing the ball to stay in the accurate alignment it needs to hit the proper area of the backboard, dropping inside the rim, resulting in a completed jump shot attempt. As we look at the player go into a shooting motion on the right frame, the player does really well at getting his ball placement above his shoulder. However, we want to tuck his elbow inside his rib cage, not having it outside of his body frame, allowing his elbow to be aligned towards the front of the rim, creating a better opportunity of the ball being directed in the accurate alignment it needs. As we look at the player go into shooting motion on the right side of the frame, a few adjustments the player can make to become more efficient is to implement the correct footwork. Since the player is left-handed shooter, he will initially step with his right foot first and then his left foot second going into his jumping motion. As we look on the right frame on our players release on his jump shot another improvement the player can make To become more efficient is to jump on his jump shot Getting a good lift off the ground Which is going to allow the ball to create more arc and accuracy and power it needs to get above the rim To be able to have a proper Angle it needs to drop through the net resulting in a completed jump shot attempt", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This she does by lowering her center of gravity so that feet are placed high and when the climber is ready she will then push down onto the feet mostly on the right foot so that she's able to gain direction to the hole that reach and in that moment once the climber gets to engage onto pushing down onto the right foot forcefully then she will engage into bending the arms to get her center of gravity close to the wall later on having to transfer the weight to the left foot being in place once landing the left hand to the hole that reach The climber starts once the climber is no longer standing on the mat and the feet are in position on the wall. As we can see the climber is sending the left foot to come into place towards the right side of the block. The climber, once creating pressure of the left foot coming into place, then she will be able to raise the hips to apply the right foot over to the hold on the wall. The climber was only able to tap the hold with the fingertips. This was due to a lack of power when performing the jump, as well as the climber would have been more successful in sustaining the grip if she kept the left foot in place. The climber right now is chocking up her hands by placing the hands inside of the chalk bag, which is attached to her. And this chalk will help with gaining a better grip before sustaining the grips, as well as absorbing any moisture that may be coming from her hands. The climber in performing the dynamic move, she has slipped off from the left foot placement. This was due to a lack of pressure and the climber had pressed hard onto the right foot to go over in that direction at reach. Now it's all a matter of time and power that the climber has committed to make this committed move. So if the climber could potentially still make the landing of the hand over the lip of the hold if she had engaged enough power but because the climber has come off from the foot placement it can also retract the move and the climber will be unable to make the hand placement. Now that both feet are into position we can see the climber pressing onto the left toe so that the climber's center of gravity is pushed over to the right side. It's important that the climber's center of gravity remains underneath her grips. The reason why the climber is leaning back to extend the arms, this is called a wrist position because the climber is not engaging on the arms and it's a time for recovery. When the climber is ready she will engage then into a pull up engaging the arms to perform the next hold at reach. As we can see the climbers placing both of the hands into the same hold as this is a one-hold start. When both hands are in the same hold this is called matching. And she's sustaining to a large hold, this one being a jug as the climbers able to wrap the hands at the lip of the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Again, he shoots it over his right shoulder. We love to see this elbow more straight. And you can see it here, how he's not really squared up. His right hip is kind of facing this wall. Again, he's pushing off. We just love for him to pick up momentum here and really lift up higher. Here he goes. Better job here of looks like that left arm comes out. You know, he's raising up here a little bit. Love that his eyes and head are up. He does a really good job with that. Again, just very little lift. He's already down on the ground. Legs are kind of locked out. Let's bring this follow through so it's more straight. You can see how he's kind of, the elbow again is going out to the right. I mean, it starts right here, of taking that dribble, which he did, and really having a big stride and a big step on this left foot, and then elevate. He's just kind of going a little bit, I don't know, 50% speed here. He's got all the fundamentals, I think. Then we pick it up a notch and go a little bit more at a higher intensity. Heads up, two hands on the ball, that's good. As he lifts, let's just be a little more explosive. We just need more strength, leg strength here to push off and to really draw and pull that right hip up. Again, more lift, more power. He's shooting a little bit like over his right shoulder. You can see how the elbow's out, which means he's kind of hooking it. Let's get it more straight onto the basket. And we do that by pivoting when we land on that left foot to kind of use it to turn our body in midair to face the basket. Again, on this push-off, will he lift? Will he really pull that right hip up? He's got the little vulnerable here sticking the ball out. Let's get it in tighter. Love that he knows where he is, though. He knows where he is in relation to that backboard. Again, very little exploding up off the foot, if you will. The right knee's already down. It's not elevated up in the air. Again, he's shooting over this right shoulder. He's just kind of flicking it up there, if you will. You know, he's got the spacing, though. He knows the target and where he wants it to go. I guess at the end of the day, that's what matters, if the ball goes in or not. We'd love to see a little bit of some distance here between the feet, like a really big step here with the left foot with a little more space. That could help him with getting more lift and power, but really use this left leg to really explode to bring this right knee up. Love that he's got two hands on the ball and his eyes and head are up once more. Same thing here, not a lot of lift and power from the legs, really relying on this kind of hook shot over the right shoulder. I do love that his fingers are pointing following the ball, that's good, and he does a really good job of using the backboard here. Here's his follow-through and landing. Again, that elbow's out. We'd like it to see more extended to the basket. I like that he's got his arm bar at 90 degree, but you could see his landing. He's a little straight up, knees are locked out, feet are flat-footed. More cushion, kind of bouncy on the landing, I would recommend. Again, would love to bring this right shoulder in and have it more square, facing the basket. He kind of shoots it over his right shoulder. I really feel like he could lift up higher. Here the shooter is doing a right hand reverse layup. He is going off the correct foot, bringing the right knee up. Arm bar is bent, 90 degree is good. I would love to see him, like as he lands on this left foot to kind of pivot and square his hips and his shoulders up. He's kind of shooting over this right shoulder instead of pulling that right shoulder in a little bit more and shooting more straight onto the basket. Here he makes his way. This big left-hand step is crucial. Like a big ol' step. We need a big ol' step and a push-off to draw that right hip up. Two hands on the ball. Eyes and head are up. That's good. Again, shoots it over the right shoulder. You can see it here. He does land with more of a knee bend. That's really good. You could see a little bit in this view how he kinda shoots it around his right shoulder instead of squaring this right shoulder up. His right hip is still pointed out to this side wall. Let's bring everything in and square it up. We should see him shooting the ball right here. Instead, he's even out of the view of the camera because his arm is way over here. Anytime you've got all this extra distance you have to cover, there's a chance for it to get blocked or a chance for the accuracy of it to be thrown off. Again, same thing, shoots it over the right shoulder, on the landing he kind of locks it out. You know, I feel like he already should still, he should already, he should still be up in the air, the ball hasn't even touched the backboard and see, because he didn't jump he's already on the ground. So let's lift it up here, let's lift our body up and finish this shot. Again, pretty good spacing here between the feet. Let's really push off this left. He's gonna bring the right hip in. Love that his eyes and head are up. He's got a pretty good angle here. Two hands on the ball. Everything looks really good there. Again, I really would love to see more explosiveness here, like to really plant and go hard. Push off this left foot and really power this right hip up. And then he's doing a good job of bringing the ball up with two hands, his eyes and head are up, but we need more power, more lift. And it's about doing these drills, this particular drill, gain speed, that's what will get you that lift.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So this is kind of a smart idea to use, knowing that he's going into another comfortable set of hands, the climber used his natural momentum to kind of put him into the next position without having to find any feet. So here we can see the climber is getting himself ready of committing to the big dino move of going over to the screen hold here. In the starting position we can see that the climber was swinging from the right and all the way back over to the left. This is a really good thing to see just because by swinging himself from left to right this is allowing him to get a good understanding of the movement that he's trying to go for. Just because his hold is over to the right and above him by going back and forth and side to side that helps to really get an understanding of the movement he's going to be experiencing right now and then especially right now in this position just because his body is so far over to the left this is the best position to kind of start in before committing to fully dinoing to the first hold. Just because it helps to apply as much power as he needs by keeping his arms in a straight position and then keeping his legs in a bent position just because those legs are the best tool in order to get up into that green hold that he's aiming for. And so here we can see the climber was able to move his left hand up into the next handhold here I'm so in that position He was hanging on with the right hand and was able to find a high foot and it does seem like he placed both feet On the wall right here Ideally, it would have been better if the climber just allowed his right foot to kind of flag down and to the left So then that way you can just reinforce all this body weight on that high left foot But it could just be that this climbers pretty comfortable and he seems to continue use momentum in order to continue up in this boulder And so here we can see that the clamber has been able to make contact with that green hold and is especially hanging on to It with both arms. So in this position just because the dino It has happened and what naturally ends up happening is his feet do swing out and away from the wall But what we can see happening is the clamber is doing a couple things in order to kind of keep himself close to the wall One of the first things that he is doing is that as he grabs on to that green hold He's immediately trying to pull in to that green hold as much as possible And this does help to keep as much of his body closer to the wall and engage the hands a little bit better So they don't come swinging away from the wall on top of that we can see that both of the climbers legs are kind of in a bent position and One of the main things to that helps out with is it helps to keep control of his core strength Just because we can see that his core is still relatively straight So this helps to reinforce that he can bring his legs back into a controlled position And prevent any further swinging from it happening", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

She was just doing that for her own memory's sake The dancers forgetting the choreography a bit, but it's doing a good job in trying to get back in rhythm and getting back to the part of the sequence in what she's supposed to be up to. The dancer is turning on her heel instead of turning on her toe, which would help her in her turn avoid friction and be able to get fully around back to the front of the room if she had her weight on her toe and then her eyes focusing to the front of the room. Again, the dancer is concentrating towards this side corner of the room where perhaps, I believe, her teacher, someone is standing that we can see or that she can see through the mirror. And the dancer should really be focused on herself and her body in this choreography and not some externalized person. The dancer's eye contact is very good here. She's looking straight ahead where she's supposed to be looking with that laser beam focus that she has with her eyes. Her arms also should have as much energy radiating both outward and upward in straight lines so she can remain feeling ease and comfort but also being strong at the same time. Again, we see what I'm talking about with her breaking her wrist, that her fingers here are pointing outward from her wrist being bent, instead of her fingers being in line with the rest of her arm. This movement which the dancer just swiped her left arm across should be a change of level and the choreography the dancer really should have gone lower to the floor. Right now her head is at the same level as it always was where she should have been bending her legs so that she can lunge to the floor and so her head really should have been lower and it would have been a change of level from originally a high level to a middle level. The dancer is also looking off to the side of the room where we hear her teacher who counted in at the beginning of the dance sequence. I imagine that she is standing or sitting that way, so she's looking at her for choreographic cues. But really, this changes the dancer's energy and her alignment of her spine. Her neck or her cervical vertebrae are now turned, whereas the rest of her vertebrae are in a straight line, and then it breaks when her head turns to the side. So instead, her head should be, or her eyes also should be facing forward so that her neck is in a straight line and her vertebrae is in one straight line, instead of looking and breaking the line by turning to face her teacher. The dancer definitely has a sense of ease when she's dancing through. She's not stiff when she dances. Her ribcage moves, her shoulder moves. She added some stylized elements. She just has to work on memorizing the choreography, not looking at her teacher and focusing where she's supposed to because it does change the whole shape of the movement when she's looking elsewhere that is not choreographed. She also can have more energy in her hands and focus on their positioning so that she's not breaking the line at her wrist. The dancer is moving her rib cage very clearly in circles, which is wonderful execution, but her hands are a bit stiff, just being held there with not her arms moving at all, which is okay if she's emphasizing her ribs in that way, but in doing so to make her hands a bit more relaxed and not stiff, so that I do concentrate on her rib cage circling instead of on her hands. Dancer does a great job here of being on her toes. Again, her heels are off the ground, which is why she's able to do these rotating steps in which she's twisting her body and moving towards her right. The dancer is doing a great job of having her weight on her toes as we see her heels are off the ground Which is why she's able to maneuver her knees Both to the right side and the left side with ease as well as with her hips to the right side and left side with ease Because she has her heels off the ground making her legs Available from the hips downward to be twisting and turning however. She needs them to be The dancer is adding extra head movements here, nodding her head up and down, which is a bit distracting from the movement that is supposed to be concentrated in other body parts and not necessarily her head and neck. Both the dancer's arms and right leg should have been extended outward in this position. Her arms instead are in fists and close to her body. And really everything should be pulling outward in this turn instead of being condensed inward. The dancer really does a great job of lifting her knee as the vocal of the music is accented. So the vocal comes to a height or a climax and that is the exact time when her knee reaches the highest point that it does in space. So her body is really mimicking the musicality and the lyrics here, which is great. She's basically another instrument in the music. The dancer's arms are a bit high at the start of this step. Her arms should be really making a straight line outward instead of a bit of an angled V position how she's making it at this very moment. She can work on this by pressing her arms downward so that they're in a complete linear line. Again, same thing here at her wrist. She's bent so that her fingers are going outward from her wrist instead of in line with the rest of her arm. She's actually doing it in both arms, both the right arm that I just noted with the spatial drawings as well as her left arm. She's doing the same thing here. The dancer is dancing with a lot of ease. She definitely feels comfortable and confident in her body. Just with the ease, it's nice that her arms are not stiff at all and they're very fluid. She just has to be careful that she's not bending her fingers too far or bending her hand too far at the wrist. We see how she's breaking her wrist so her hand is flicked downward, which is saying that she's comfortable, but it's breaking the line of her arm when her fingers are pointing downward that far.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This one, the left arm has come in between the wall and him and quickly to bring it up for the reach. However, the climber will need to make sure to wave the arm slightly away from the wall and to the left side. This to force more engagement of his body to be closer to the wall. And the other one is at the right foot right now it's being in place but as we can see he has made a push on the left foot to go up in the leap. Reason why the left foot has let go from the wall. So it's important that the climber brings his weight quickly over to the highest foot when making the pull as he makes the lunge. Here you can see the climber had made a slight change on his positioning where he no longer wanted to rely on the high foot placement only and instead has brought his left foot that was out on the flag to be placed down below this so that he can have two areas of support when making this stance up to the next hold. Now that the climber has secured the grip above being the right hand on the pinch, we can see how the climber now is making a foot switch down below, bringing the left foot that was out on the flag to be placed where the right foot was. The climber was able to make the move out of the start hold. He does this by bringing his right foot into the wall and he's no longer in the mat. So the climb has a start. And as we can see the leg, right leg is extended. And this is for the climber to keep balance. This is called flagging in. And so it will help the climber to shift his center of gravity to be pushed by the left foot being in place. The climber then brought himself in by making a forceful pull up and sending the left hand up to a pinch. If the climber was going to attempt this again, it was good of the climber to push on both of the feet but mainly on the left foot. This one to allow a leap up to the reach. But needs to continue to engage on the grip on the right hand and lock the move so that he can keep his chest towards the wall. And same wise to bring his hips over to the right side once making the stance to then be supported with the right foot. Once the climber gets to secure the grip above, then the climber can release any other limbs to make the next placement. It's important that when the climber is making the next move, he uses the highest foot to push down and this one as he is leaning back on the highest hold, right hand, then forces to bring his center of gravity being on the core to be raised by pushing down on the on the foot. This to prepare him to have a more effective reach when going up next to the hold. In this instance, the climber made the choice to swap his heel hook to be a toe placement instead. Since this is a big edge, the climber can do this switch comparably. Here we can see the climber making some hand gestures. This will help the climber to visualize what the sequence will be and when he will need to make the hand placement for each hold when on the wall. When the climber made the reach, was able to place the hand, however, was not able to engage on creating pressure to it due to the right foot. Once he was pressing on it, instead it was pushing him away from the wall. This will not help the climber to bring the center of gravity to the foot that's been placed above. So at this point, the climber will be going down, unable to sustain the grip above. Here we can see how the climber was able to secure the grip with the right hand this one being a pinch which he will need to lean back in order to create pressure for the fingers that are placed above and presses with the thumb underneath. This is called a pinch so he can clamp the grip meaning create force to then release pressure down at the feet which he did by bringing his left foot that was out on a flag to be placed where the right foot was and quickly brings the right foot into place this one by sending the heel in behind the hold edge. So this one heel hooks are usually known to be technical foot placements because will keep the climber stable almost acting as a third hand as we can see the right foot is placed at a highest stance. As a climber came to secure the left hand grip, he has to continually pull on the grips. This releases some pressure to allow a foot swap down at the foot chip below. The climber still needs to continually activate some pressure down at the feet to avoid from swinging out or detached from the wall. So he does this by first placing the toe onto the foothold by rolling in the toe onto the foothold as the left toe rolls out of the foothold and is released. As the climber is getting himself positioned to the start hold, this one being a one hold in which the climber is sustaining right hand being a pinch as the thumb is involved in pinching underneath, clamping the right hand for sustaining the move and the left hand is just placed above so the climber will have to create pressure by leaning on the hold. Now in order for the climber to start the climb he will have to bring both of the feet off the mat", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Her heels instead should be lifted higher off the ground. The dancer doesn't execute her arms completely incorrectly here. She should be windmilling both arms around, backwards to forwards, kind of like a swim stroke. She does do that with her right arm, but she doesn't complete that revolution with her left arm. The dancer's hands are also crossing too far here. We see her left hand is grabbing her right wrist, but instead it should be closer to her fingertips meeting rather than her fingertips and one wrist. When the dancer is stepping forward here with her right foot, she's doing so at an angle. Her toes are pointing to the front right corner of the room and instead her toes should be pointing straight ahead. She's also bending at her knees and her legs should be completely straight. Her spine should be in a completely straight line with her legs straightened as well. The dancer should be making this position larger by bending lower here so that she has a change of level from higher to down lower. The dancer is also not vertically aligned. We see that her spine is on the diagonal backwards. It should be in a straight line instead. Also in that windmill position, around and forwards, both arms should be completely straight. She mostly straightens her right arm, but does not straighten her left arm completely. She also can make this position larger by opening her legs or widening them further, moving her left leg further behind her so that she's able to get down lower and dropping her pelvis in between her two legs.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

But the foot, it seems like she's towing in through the foot too hard. So as she tries to get her weight up and over it, she loses tension and it picks off. So what she needs to do is kind of push with that right foot again. Add that, push her body to the left. And then when her body's over that foot, she can kind of stand up through it to keep the tension. And then hit that hold. So gets into the undercling and is in a nice body position both our arms are straight. Cora seems to be engaged but she's lacking pushing with this right foot. She needs to push with the right foot to send her up into the left so that way she can get above this undercling. Kind of gives up on the undercling, isn't able to kind of pull her weight through. So if this moves, since it's an undercling, pulling in, all it's going to do is kind of bring her closer to the wall. She needs to get up to this yellow hold.

So again, you'll see the player now doing the scissor with a straight leg around the ball with his left foot. So the action of coming inside the ball around the outside to the left is good, but I'd like to see the player moving a little bit more fluently with the ball where instead of this straight leg around the ball, we have a slight knee bend, which means that we will be getting our body moving more fluently in the direction that the ball is traveling instead of being in this upright position, which is gonna limit our ability to change direction at speed and protect the ball. Again, players dribbling action is relatively fluent, keeps the ball close, shows good technical foundations but again as we're dribbling we want to continue to see the same actions as he's preparing for a skill. So toe down, heel up so we can really make contact with the laces of the ball through the middle of the ball so we can get into a more regular running pattern as he's dribbling towards preparing. You can see obviously the feet are relatively close together so that's going to obviously show the speed that the player is travelling at and the preparation so we want to always try and stay as low to the ground by getting this, if he's dribbling with his right foot, right knee over the ball, bend his left knee, get his hips low to the ground, get his body leaning slightly forward with his head position and his chest in line with the ball so as we're travelling forward our body is moving forward with the ball and it gives ourselves the best possible chance to maintain our balance, protect the ball, change direction at speed. I like the player is not just solely focused on the ball, you can see the player's head up as he's dribbling so keeping the ball in the lower extremities of the vision but also keeping his head up to look around and see where the space is, where the defenders are. As the player is executing the scissor, we can see the player does get into a lower position with his left knee. Right leg for me is still slightly too straight as he is doing the scissor. Again this is related to the ball rolling and the placement of the left foot in preparation for the scissor. The further forward that left foot can be planted, we can get our body closer to the line of the ball, get our knee slightly bent as we are moving our right foot around the ball which will help us with the next action in terms of stepping and then pushing off and changing direction. I want the body to still be moving in the direction of the ball so we lean our chest forward, head so it's closer to the line of the ball. Just gives ourselves better opportunity to protect the ball, change direction and speed. It's also important in terms of a skill to change direction that we are looking to disguise the skill so we are trying to make the defender go one way so we create space to go the other. So as we bend our knee, it's also an opportunity to move our body, drop our shoulder. So we are going to step to the left, we want to try and drop our shoulder to the left, make the defender go one way, create the space to go the other. So with the use of the scissor, we will step over, bend our knee, drop our shoulder to the right so we create the space to go the opposite. Play again just preparing to conduct a scissor skill so the approach is important so when we're dribbling we want to try and keep the ball close as we're about to execute the skill we want to slow down, slow the direction of the ball down so we can have full control and then change speed after the skill. So the player here you can see toe pointing slightly down, he's still pushing the ball a little bit closer to the toe, we'd like him to get a little bit closer to the ball, push the ball with his laces, put the knees in a good position, we can be a little bit lower to the ground, sink our hips, get our chest leaning slightly further forward so our head and our chest is over the top of the ball so as we're dribbling in this direction our body position is moving in that same way. So the player is in a decent position here as he's preparing to execute the 1v1 skill. Again, the players is executing the scissor. It's pretty fluent in his motion, but again, just because of the speed, the players traveling at the intent, because the left foot plants kind of alongside, slightly behind the ball. As we do the scissor, we end up with this straight leg going around the ball. So as this right leg is going inside the ball around to the outside, I'd like to see the player's body position lower to the ground, chest still leaning forward, slight knee bend in this right leg as he goes around. So the time to get around the ball, plant this right foot down and push off in the opposite direction is gonna be less, so we can be more effective in the skill. You can see the players dribbling technique is generally okay. The speed obviously we're travelling at is a little bit slower, more change in direction than dribbling at speed. So I'd still like to see the player dribbling a little bit lower to the ground. We can see very upright body position as he's changing direction, dribbling with his foot in a decent position to control the direction of the ball. I just want to see the player dribble more with the laces, his toe down, heel up, so we can get this knee over the ball and dribble with a lower centre of gravity, bend the knees, drop the hips lower, so we have better balance, better control, better ball protection, better ability to change direction with speed. Again, as the player is slowing down, ready to execute the scissor skill, we can see the preparation step with the left foot, as he's going to execute the scissor with the right. Again he's kind of behind and level with the line of the ball, so remember the ball is rolling forwards. So when we're looking to do the scissor, if we can step in front of the ball, then obviously as we do the scissor, that's going to help our body position in terms of being over the ball, bend that knee, have that effective change of direction and speed. The player here, you can see in a very upright position, so we want to bend this left knee, get it further forward, keep our hips low, keep our chest leaning slightly forward, so it's kind of in line with either the backside of the ball, if not the middle of the ball, so we're just moving in unison with the direction that we're dribbling. Play again just executing a Cruyff turn to change direction. It's not really going into the Cruyff turn at full speed but again we can see body position, straight leg with the standing leg, straight leg with the the Cruyff turn so that leads to an upright body position. We want to try and make sure when we're dribbling changing direction, executing any skills, bending our knees, lowering our hips, getting our body centered with the ball so whichever direction we are traveling with our body is turning and moving with it so as he does the Cruyff turn brings that right foot around the front of the ball, makes contact with the front of the ball to push it through the legs so the technique in itself is okay in terms of the contact with the ball and the action but obviously the body position very upright we can be a lot lower to the ground have a lot more opportunity to protect the ball, change speed, change direction. As the player prepares to execute the Cruyff Turn, the Cruyff Turn is just where we are obviously changing the direction of the ball, so we're travelling forwards and we want to change the direction of the ball to go 180 degrees behind us. The Cruyff Turn is where we want to make sure we bring this right foot around the front of the ball, start to turn our body, use the inside of the foot with the front of the ball to pull the ball back through our legs and behind. So important as obviously the ball is rolling forwards that the non-kicking foot plants slightly in front of the ball so we don't end up doing the Cruyff Turn reaching for the ball. So here the left foot is slightly behind the ball so we're going to end up reaching a little bit, but we can see the player starting to bend his knees, bring that right foot around, slowing down, getting his body starting to lean back towards the direction he wants to go, which is hopefully going to help him change direction and change fluently with both the body and the ball. Players just finished the scissor action with the right foot around the ball, stepping to the side of the ball. There becomes a slight knee bend in this right leg. You can see the body is starting to lean in the direction he wants to go. As he's bringing this left leg inside the ball, that's an opportunity to bend this right knee, drop our right shoulder down. So we pull the defender one way to create space to attack the other. Obviously, we're bringing the left foot inside to push the ball away in a forward direction to the left. So again, we can see the body position of the player is a little upright in terms of the action itself. But the player shows good, solid technical foundations that, given an opponent, potentially would improve the technical actions. Just looking at the execution of the scissor, again as the player is bringing his right foot around the inside of the ball to the out, scissor itself is okay. I'd just like to see slightly closer to the ball, slighter grade at knee bend so we can bring our hips lower to the ground through the skill. Just allows us better balance, better control, better ball protection and also allow us, obviously if we're going around the ball with a straight leg at this point, it's just going to take a little bit longer for us to get the right foot out to the side of the ball, bend our knee so then we can push off in the opposite direction. So, a little bit lower to the ground, lower hips, keep his body leaning slightly further forward and that will give him the most effective way to execute the skill in a game situation. Players use the Cruyff Turn for change of direction. Cruyff Turn, just bringing that leg around the front of the ball, making contact with the inside of the foot, with the front of the ball to push the ball through the legs. Important as we make contact, that as we're changing direction of the ball, our body is changing direction as well. We want to try and stay as low to the ball as we can, bend our knees, low hip placement, and on contact, players doing a good job of turning his body with the ball. So as the ball leaves his feet, he can move fluently with the ball at speed. Yn ymwneud \u00e2'r chwaraewyr, mae'r gwaith sysa'n mynd o le i'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd.

Again, as the ball is slowing down slightly as it's travelling, we can see there's a slighter knee bend now in the left leg, but it's still relatively straight. So it just shows an impact on where the right foot, the standing foot plants. We can see there's a slight knee bend in that right leg, but we're still upright in our body position. So we want to try and get forward, lean our body forward slightly with the direction of the ball and execute the skill so the ball is a little closer to our feet so we can have this slight knee bend in the left leg. So as that left leg comes around the ball now, when we plant that left foot to the ground, we're going to have that opportunity to push off that and get a better position to balance, protect and change direction with speed. So looking at the execution of the scissor, so for me we want to try and stay as low to the ground as possible and keep our body momentum moving forward. Here you'll see because the ball is rolling and obviously the preparation step to the side of the ball was kind of levelling behind it. We're now doing the scissor now with a straight leg around the ball from inside to out. So the scissor itself is not too bad but we want to try and get our body moving forward, lower centre of gravity, bend our knees, can we get our chest leaning slightly forward in the direction that the ball is travelling and be in a position where we can slightly bend our knee as we're coming over. So as we plant that right foot down to the ground that's going to allow us to disguise the skill, accelerate as well as protect the ball. So the player is just preparing to do the scissor action again. We can see in the dribbling motion, the player is not necessarily dribbling at game-related speed, but keeping the ball close, staying tight with the ball to his feet, which is obviously important, so he can change direction when he's looking to. We can see as he's dribbling, still pushing the ball a little bit with the toe areas, he's preparing, slowing the ball down. Still like to see the player dribble more with the laces, toe down, heel up. So we just maximise the contact surface between the foot and the ball. Again, the body is in an OK position with the knees slightly bent. We'd like the player to get a little bit lower as he's dribbling, especially in preparation for a skill. Get this body lower to the ground, leaning slightly forward so his chest and his head is in a more stable position over the top of the ball, just so we are moving in unison with the ball and dribbling with effective speed, balance and control. So just finishing off the scissor action, so the player comes around the ball with the right leg, I like the footwork in the players action, very light on his feet, balls of his feet, lands on the right leg, slight knee bend in the right, brings the left foot inside the line of the ball ready to push the ball away, so it's important that when we bend this right leg as we step out and bring this left foot away, that when we push away with the left foot with the ball, that that right leg is in a good position where we can push off that back leg to attack the space with speed. You can see the players body position is obviously bending his knees, starting to lean towards the left hand side, if anything we just want that body to be leaning slightly further forward and really then push off into that space, get our body, our hips and our chest starting to lean in the direction that we want the ball to go so we can effectively change direction at speed. Again, it's looking at the approach for the skill. So we've obviously slowed down, kept the ball close. Remember the ball is traveling in a forward direction. So it's gonna affect where we wanna plant our left foot. In this case, as we do the scissor with the right. So we are stepping to the side of the ball with the left foot. Again, if the ball is traveling forward, we wanna make sure that we are stepping slightly in front of the ball. So then we can bring this right leg around from the inside to the outside of the ball with the right leg, without the ball going too far away from us. So you see as the player's slowing down, he's getting into a more upright body position. I want the player to stay low, bend his knees, sink his hips, keep his chest leaning slightly forward. So his body momentum is moving in the same direction as the ball. And then he can utilize that left knee bending, dropping the left shoulder a little bit further down to disguise the scale, to create space to go to the right or the left. The player here just in preparation to execute a Cruyff turn to change direction. We see his general dribbling technique, not necessarily with the laces, more just to keep the ball close, small touches. Now redirects the ball, we can see the foot position here, toe pointing out, hitting the ball close to the big toe. So we're not dribbling necessarily with speed, just more dribbling to maintain direction and control with a soft touch. We can see obviously as the player is looking to change the direction of the ball, the knee position is moving out and in, which is fine. Obviously the foot position is going to redirect the ball, change the direction of the ball coming out this way. Bending our knees, dropping our hips is important to maintain a low centre of gravity as we are preparing to change direction or dribbling. Just want to try and keep that body leaning slightly forward in the direction that we are travelling as we prepare for the skill. And just talking about the general dribbling technique of the player, ideally when we're dribbling in straight lines, we're effectively looking to dribble with our laces. So pointing our toe down to the ground, heel up, that helps us get our knee over the ball, bend that knee, get our hips low to the ground, bend this left knee, get our body, here you can see leaning slightly forward, head in line with the ball. By dribbling with our laces allows us to move in a more fluent running action. Obviously when we're using this area by the little toe, towards the top of the foot, our ability to push the ball and run with the ball at speed is limited and also the control over the ball is just limited because of the amount of surface area and contact between the foot and the ball. Again we can see the player executing the scissor, again because where the left foot planted and the direction the ball is rolling, we're now doing the scissor with a straight leg in front. So by the time that right leg comes around the ball and lands, the ball obviously is going to continue to travel and it's going to just make it harder for us to move effectively with the ball, change direction at speed. So we want to obviously get that non-kicking foot, the left foot, when it plants to prepare for the scissor a little bit closer to the ball. We can see the body position, very upright, so we want to try and stay as low to the ground as possible, bend our knees, get our hips low to the ground, keep our chest leaning slightly forward throughout the dribbling action and obviously if we're going to step to the right, be prepared to now drop our right shoulder as we're moving our right leg around the ball to disguise the skill and create space by moving the defender where we want them to go. Again, player just finishing off the single scissor, but he's gonna be going into a double scissor. So whether he's gonna attack the space or go into a double scissor, he still want this right foot. As this right foot finishes moving around the ball from inside to out, still step slightly in front of the ball. As we step to the side of the ball, wanna bend this right knee, keep our body low to the ground and the ball. As we're bringing this left foot inside the ball, we wanna be dropping our, bend as we bend our right knee, we'll drop our body to the right hand side, which makes the defender move with us. So we create the space where we want the ball to go. So it's important that the player continues to keep his body moving in preparation for creating the space as he's executing the skill. Here you can see the player as he finishes off the scissor with the right, he steps in a good position wide of the ball. By stepping wider of the ball, allows the player to now bend this right knee, drop this right shoulder, potentially pull the defender this way to create space to go the opposite. And then obviously by bending the knee, brings our hips lower to the ground, lower centre of gravity, better balance, better control. So although the right leg is in a better position, still want his body to be leaning towards the right, so right shoulder dropping down as he brings his left foot inside the ball to push the ball away, just added disguise, balance and control to be able to push off. And just looking at the player's preparation before executing, this time a double scissor. So we can see the dribbling action. The player is controlling the ball well, small touches, keeping it close, able to manipulate the ball, change direction when he wants to. And we can see again the player utilising more the toe area and the outside of the foot just to redirect the ball, keep it close. When we're dribbling, I'd like to see the player with his toe down, heel up, knees in a good position. You can see the running stride is getting a little bit larger, so we're moving with a little bit more speed. So we just want to keep our body in a low position, hips low, bend our knees, get into that running stride, get our chest leaning slightly forward with our head in a position closer to the line of the ball. But the player in terms of dribbling in this forward direction is in a good position working on the balls of his feet, moving quite freely, keeping the ball close with small touches. Here a very good example of the Cruyff Turn. So we see the non-kicking foot and his preparation is stepping slightly in front of the line of the ball which is going to help the body position get closer to the ball and more centred. Obviously the action of the Cruyff Turn bringing the right leg around the outside of the ball to the front of the ball presenting the inside of the foot with the front of the ball to push the ball through the legs. You can see here that the right toe is pointing out and the body is already with this knee bend here and the body and the hips you can see are already turning in the direction, facing the direction the toes are pointing which is going to allow him as he pushes his ball through his legs to turn onto the ball quickly. You can also see in some of the prior Cruyff Turns he's reaching for the ball with a straight leg in an upright body position here, much better position with his knees bent, hips sunk, body in a more centred position with the ball so the player is in a better position to maintain his balance and change direction with speed. Player moving into the double scissor action. So again, as we're dribbling or changing direction or executing a skill, I wanna see the player really bending his knees, keeping his hips low, again, his body leaning forwards in the direction of the ball and see the ball is traveling forwards and the scissor action is gonna, obviously if he's doing a scissor around the ball inside to out, it will be to effectively pull the defender one way, create the space to go in the opposite direction. If our body is upright and leaning backwards as we execute these skills, it's gonna affect our ability to change direction at speed. Again, player in the middle of the Cruyff turn action, so he's not really disguising the skill to change direction at speed, so coming from an upright position. But just like most of the dribbling skills and dribbling in motion, we want to try and be as low to the ball as possible, bend our knees, lower our hips, keep our body centred over the ball. So as we change direction, we can change speed, protect the ball, change direction. You can see as the player brings his right foot around the ball, his body is starting to turn around, which is good. So not waiting until after the contact to turn is important to reduce the time it takes to change the direction of the ball and move onto the ball at the same time. But obviously the player here is in a more upright position, so that's going to limit the player's ability to maintain full balance and be able to explode away at speed. And just finishing off the Cruyff turn action, you can see as he finishes the action, as the ball's rolling back, he's already moving onto the ball. He's in a much lower body position, knee bent, obviously pushing off this back leg in this moment. Hips are a little bit lower, body's leaning forwards in the direction that the ball is going. So it's so important when we're dribbling, changing direction, that as we're making contact with the ball or we're changing direction, our body is moving with the ball at that moment so we can effectively travel with more speed, more control, more effectiveness. a chwarae yn gyflawni cryfder, felly dyma'r pwynt cyntaf gyda'r cryfder.

Felly, wrth ei ddod i'r ball, mae'n meddwl y bydd e'n ystod yn well i ddod i'w llawn. And as we're preparing now to finish the scissor action, we wanna make sure that as we step around the ball with the right foot, this right foot goes forward and to the side and we bend our knee, drop our right shoulder as we're bringing this left foot on the inside of the ball. By dropping the right shoulder, bending the right knee, we'll disguise the skill to make the defender think we're gonna go one way, create the space, and also get our body in a position where we can push off and attack the space in the game or even change direction and move away based on what the player's doing in this activity. Here you can see a straight leg on landing, body up straight, so in terms of executing the skill with high proficiency in game relatedness, he's lacking that final piece in terms of the disguise and the change of direction and speed. Again, player just preparing to do the scissor skill. So once again, think about the ball is moving forward. So player is stepping to the side of the ball with the left foot and see that the foot is level with the ball as the ball is rolling. So that's gonna affect the scissor action when we move this foot around the ball and that we can execute the skill with the most effect. So we wanna try and get this non-kicking foot, the left foot planted slightly in front of the ball, slightly further away so we can bend our knee, give ourselves that room to really exaggerate the skill, bring that right leg around, get lower to the ground. Obviously the closer the left foot is to the ground, the more difficult it is gonna be to bend those knees, get our hips low and start to get our body lower to the ground for better ball protection, speed and balance. So again, just looking at the preparation as the player is preparing to do a single scissor. So the approach and the dribbling technique with the ball is important. Can we keep the ball close to our feet, small touches as we're preparing to do the skill. So slow down before the skill. Can we get our knees in a low position? So bend our knees, sink our hips, see the body position here is better, chest leaning slightly forward, head in a position over the ball, so the player in a much better position to dribble. Just like the toe to be pointed slightly further down, so we're making contact with the laces through the middle of the ball, not necessarily pushing the ball closer to the toes, just to get a cleaner dribbling pattern with the right foot. If we dribble with the laces with the toe down, we're just replicating more of that running motion that we're naturally running with the player in terms of his preparation to execute the 1v1 skill, the scissor is in a good position. and preparing to execute the scissor skill. So obviously any type of 1v1 skill is to disguise a skill, make defenders go one way, create the space to go the other. So obviously if we're stepping to the left side of the ball, we wanna try and exaggerate the movement. So we step out to the side of the ball, so the defender thinks that we're gonna go this way, which will create space the opposite. So as we step to the side of the ball, we wanna make sure that we understand that the ball is rolling away. If we step behind the line of the ball that the player is doing here, that's gonna affect the outcome of the scissor. So we wanna step in front of the line of the ball, step to the side, definitely have a greater knee bend. So we bring our body lower to the ground, hips lower. We can see the body is upright. We still wanna be moving in the direction of the ball. So lean our chest slightly further forward so it's in line with the ball. Get our head over the ball, so we're maximizing our speed and effectiveness in the dribble. So the player is finishing up the double scissor. So obviously the ball is slowing down due to the time the ball is traveling the speed. The player entered the skill. We can see the player again in a somewhat upright position, slowing down, you can see his back up straight and maybe leaning back a little bit, straight leg with the scissor skill. So we wanna make sure that we maintain speed momentum throughout the skill, so we can change direction effectively with speed. So we do that by again, keeping our body low to the ground, bending our knees, dropping our hips, getting our body moving with the direction of the ball, either in disguise or finishing up the skill. Player slightly better position here for some of the previous scissors you see there is a slight knee bend in this action based on the speed that the ball is travelling. You see the proximity from the non-kicking front of the ball allows the player to bend that knee slightly which is going to help as he finishes off this action from going around the inside of the ball to the outside. That he can plant his foot in a position and get his knee bent on the right side where he can drop his right shoulder and create the space by moving defenders one way and give himself a stable position to now push off and attack with the left foot. You can see the left knee slightly bent but the body is still upright based on obviously the left foot being a little close to the ball as he steps in preparation for the skill. So we want to try and keep our hips low to the ground to help improve our balance, control, opportunity to change direction, speed, keep our body moving in the direction that we are looking to disguise or looking to accelerate and move away into. Again, player just preparing for the scissor, so player keeps the ball close, small touches, slowing down before the skill. But then again, we can see the left foot. If we're going to execute the scissor, we need to create that room and space to bring that right leg around the front of the ball from inside to out, plant our right foot on the outside. So to do that, if the ball is traveling forwards, we want to make sure that this left foot is going further out, planting in front of the ball, slightly wider so we can bend our knee, create the space to bring that right leg inside and around. And what that will do is also allow us to get lower to the ground, bend our knees, get our hips lower, get our body moving so we can disguise the skill, create space by moving the defenders and also create a foundation and a base for us to be able to push off, change direction at speed. We're looking at the player preparing to execute a scissor skill, which is a 1v1 dribbling skill. Looking at the approach, so the way the player is dribbling the ball, body position. So we want the body to be generally behind the line of the ball. We want to be dribbling with our toe down, heel up, knee slightly bent forward, making sure that we're dribbling with a low center of gravity as much as we can. So again, our hips lower, body leaning slightly further forward, head in a position closer to the line of the ball. That low center of gravity just allows us to change direction, protect the ball, and change speed more effectively. and we can see as the player is finishing off the skill the right foot plants slightly to the side of the ball, bends his knee slightly, starts to turn his body towards where he's wanting to go as he pushes the left foot so it's important as his right foot lands to the ground we bring that left foot quickly on the inside of the ball so then we can push the ball away into the space that we want to create. Again there's no genuine game situation here so the player is not really attacking the space, just more changing direction and dribbling keeping the ball close but we want to make sure at the end of this skill we're in a low body position, bend our knees, get our hips low, starting to turn in the direction we want to go next, get our chest and our body turning in the direction we want to go next and not be necessarily in this upright position because that's going to affect our ability to change direction at speed. And we can see the player preparing to do the scissor skill with the right foot, so the preparation step with the left foot is important. We can see in terms of in relation to the ball, we're stepping behind the line of the ball. So as we're considering the ball is rolling forwards, we want to try and get this left foot further forward and slightly further out away from the ball so we can bend this left knee, really disguise the skill, give ourselves space to really exaggerate the skill and create the space for ourselves. So we want to see this left knee step out a little bit wider, bend this left knee, sink our hips, get nice and low to the ground as we're executing the skills to improve our balance, our control, our speed, keep our body leaning slightly forward so we're still moving in an effective direction with the ball. So the player here just making contact with the ball for the Cruyff turn. Ideally this right leg would have a knee bend in it, making contact through the middle of the front of the ball. You can see obviously the player making contact with a straight leg. This is just because of the ball obviously rolling in the position of the left foot as he's preparing to turn. So now we're just going to lose certain elements of balance throughout the skill and the ability to really push off and change direction at maximum speed. So you can see obviously although the left knee is bent, the body is leaning back and upright as he reaches out with his straight leg. So we just want to try and make sure that we stay with our hips as close to the ball as we can, bend our knees, lower our hips, keep our body in a more centred position so as we change direction we can push off at speed. Again, we can see, again, the scissor action from the player is relatively smooth, but in terms of technical action to gain relatedness and speed, obviously elements of speed and control and balance that we can improve. So you can see as the player is doing the scissor, again, with a straight leg, I'd want to see the player with the ball a little bit closer where he can bring that left leg around the ball with a slight knee bend, which just prepares him to be able to plant that foot quicker to the ground, get his body in a better position to now push off and accelerate into the speed. The longer the stride between the plant foot and the foot doing the scissor, obviously as the ball is rolling away, it's just going to affect the next action of changing direction, changing speed. We can see the body is very upright, so the player's hips are low just because he's reaching out with that left leg a little bit. We want to try and make sure that we stay in a nice, low, centred position behind the ball using the bending of the knee, dropping the shoulder to disguise the skill, create the space. Just looking at the finishing action of the scissor. So again, the idea of any type of 1v1 skill, change of direction is to change direction quickly, to switch the point of the attack, or to separate away from the defender. So we wanna look at when we finish the skills, what's the technique with the part of the foot, and can we change speed and change direction into the space that we've created. So you can see here, the player, after he's finished the double scissor, just due to the activity to a degree, but he's in an upright position, and knees are not necessarily bent, or looking to push away into space, or he hit placement, so the player isn't gonna be able to change direction and speed. Player is looking to potentially turn around to the right, so that's obviously gonna control the position of the foot, and the part of the foot the player's looking to dribble with. i gael y chwaraewr yn gweithio'r sgiliau sgiliau, felly mae'r chwaraewr yn dangos ddifrifol technigol da, ond yn amlwg, i mi, rwy'n amlwg, rwy'n am bod yn y llaw i'r ffwrdd, nid ymwneud \u00e2'r llwybrau'n ymwneud \u00e2'r ball, felly ymdrech y gwleidyddol o ddangos y llwybrau ddrech ar y gwleidyddol o'r ball a'i rhoi ar y gwleidyddol o'r ddrech o'r ball yn dda, ond rwy'n am gweld y chwaraewr yn dda i'r ball, yn mynd gyda mwy o gyflym, drwy'r sgiliau, ymgyrchu'r llwybrau ar y gwaelod yma wrth ei ddod o gwmpas y ball, i'w parhau i'w gwneud ymdrech arall yn y sgiliau.

You see the player just executing a little Cruyff turn just to change direction so he takes his touch from his left foot towards his right before pulling the ball back. Again, any change of direction, dribbling, skill, we want to try and see the player nice and low to the ground, bend his knees, drop his hips, keep his body centred with the ball as much as he can. Here you can see the player in a relatively upright position so we want to be nice and low through these skills so as we push the ball through we can explode and accelerate and change direction onto the ball. Player just in preparation for again going into a scissor action. So as the player is obviously dribbling forwards, we want to make sure that we are slowing down in preparation for the skill, keeping the ball under control. So the player is doing a good job of keeping the ball close, manipulating the ball, changing direction. We can see his dribbling action. Again he's more redirecting the ball as he's dribbling rather than looking to dribble with speed. So ideally when we're dribbling I'd still like to see this toe pointing down, heel up. So we're making contact with the laces, with the middle of the ball, just to help us improve our speed and effectiveness of our dribbling. We see obviously the player here is in an upright body position. So as we're preparing to slow down, to change direction or to execute a skill or just dribbling in general motion, we want to try and get this dribbling foot, leg, knee over the ball, bend our knees. Obviously bend our left knee, get our hips lower to the ground, lower centre of gravity. Better balance, better control, better ball protection. When we change direction, get ourselves in a better body position to change speed. Get our chest leaning slightly forward and head in a position which is closer to the line of the ball. I like the player here is not looking at the ball, he's looking ahead. So it's important when we're dribbling we have this awareness of what's around us. Keep checking where the ball is but then dribbling with our head up so we can see the ball in our lower extremity as well as what's in front of us. Again, player dribbling, not really dribbling to attack space or speed, so more just kind of touching the ball, keeping it close, which is good, so that allows him to change direction when he wants to. But again, the foot very parallel to the ground, just kind of shuffling a little bit with it, pushing the ball more with the toe area of the foot. So although we're keeping it close, we're not dribbling in a way that's going to help us increase our speed and control. So we want to toe down, make contact with the laces through the middle of the ball to maximise our touch, our control, our running stride. Can we stay as low over the ball as we can as we're dribbling? So right knee over the ball if he's dribbling with his right foot, left knee bent, hips nice and low. Can we keep our chest leaning slightly forward so our head and our chest is in line with that ball? So as we're dribbling forward, our body momentum is moving with it. And by having that low centre of gravity helps us in terms of that change of direction, change of speed, balance, ball protection and control. ymgeisydd yn parhau i dilyn y sgwrs unig gyda sgwrs dwy.

The player just preparing to follow up the first scissor action with a double scissor. So two of the same action in a row, one with the right foot, one with the left. Again we can see as the player plants that right foot after the previous action, it's a straight leg, body upright, obviously the ball is slowing down but still moving forward so we want to try and get that plant foot in front of the ball as much as we can, keep our body leaning slightly forward and making sure if we're planting this right foot to the side of the ball that we're bending that right knee, dropping our right shoulder because we want to create space by moving the defender by using our body to disguise the skill so it gives ourselves the opportunity to push off in the opposite direction or to really manipulate the defender where we want them to go. Here the player just finishing off the technical action with the Cruyff turn. For me with the Cruyff turn, if we're in a best balanced position possible, as we make contact with the ball with the right foot, our right foot will move with the ball and push the ball out into that space. Here, because the player obviously is reaching out for the ball with a straight leg, he's more in a kind of a chopping action or a stop and a slight pushing action. What is positive here obviously is the right foot turns on the inside. You can see the player's body already turning with the ball. So the hips are turning, the chest is turning. So as the ball is moving backwards, the player's body is already moving in the correct direction to move onto the ball. You can see the player nice and light with his feet. This left leg being bent brings his hips a little bit lower to the ground and his body is starting to move and lean in the direction he wants to go next. Prior to executing the 1v1 skill, the scissor skill, we want to look at the approach and the preparation. So that would be if we're going to do the scissor with the right foot, then we want to step to the side of the ball with the left foot. And as this left foot steps to the side of the ball, we obviously want to figure out where the direction of the ball is traveling. So the ball is traveling forwards. So if we step either level or behind the ball, the ball is going to be obviously in front of us as we perform the skill. So we want to try and step out to the side of the ball and in front of the ball. So as the ball rolls, the ball is not traveling too far away from us. Make sure that we are bending this left knee so that then drops the left shoulder. Because in the game situation, we want to make the defender think that we're going one way. So we're going to step, use the balls of our feet, bend our knee, get our hips forward, get our body leaning slightly forward. So here you see the players in an upright position, so it's going to make it less effective and efficient to disguise the skill and perform the skill. The player now prepares to do a scissor action with the right leg. The scissor is bringing the right leg around the inside of the ball, around the front of the ball and then landing his right foot to the outside of the ball. Just to disguise the skill and make the defender go one way. To do that we want to make sure that the ball is travelling in a forward direction. So if the ball is rolling forwards we want to plant our left foot accordingly. So we want to try and plant that left foot in front of the current position of the ball, slightly further to the side so we have space to bring that right leg in and around. By getting that left leg further away from the ball will allow us to get into a lower body position, protect the ball, change direction, bend our knees etc. So it's important we get that left foot in the right position. We can see as the player plants his left foot it's a straight leg, upright body position. So although the player is slowing down, we don't want to slow down to a point where we're leaning back and upright. That's going to affect our ability to both protect the ball and change direction at speed.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Musician looks good here. Instrument comes at a good angle from their neck, nice and tall spine. Even though the tempo is sped up from the beginning because those first initial double stops are difficult, these do sound really good and the way they're practicing them is a good technique for getting one note to sound really excellent and then learning the spacing for the double stop. This bow stroke that they're using sounded and felt a little different when they were on the G string than they did on the upper strings.

It's still, still kind of balanced in between. So try to get that heel off the floor. So the dancer starts stepping in place with the triple step. She's bending her knees very slightly, so she can really bend them a little bit more and picking up her feet off the floor and then being a little bit more on her toes. When she does the three steps, she'll kind of pause after the third, so I think she should just try to keep moving and keep her arms flowing in that stillness, so it's not so stiff. Her turns to the right were really good. The turns to the left felt a little slow. And I think it's just because the way she has to step to get into that turn. So I would just say try to spot and turn a little bit faster just to stay with the music. So here she is stepping out to the side. I think her steps can be a little bit bigger. I feel like her energy is a little bit low. And this is a basic class, so the steps are really simple. So I think her energy just needs to be lifted up a bit.

Now the climber, if it's able to demonstrate controlling the stability over his body position and sustaining until the last hold, then the climb is completed. The climber is able to transfer his left hand from being underneath of him as an undercling to the jug above as he continues to hold on to his areas of support being the right hand and the left foot being in place. The right hand right now is the most solid grip at this moment while the toe hook the climber continues to extend the leg to apply pressure at the toe to also apply force onto that other placement. The climber was able to transition over the right hand up for the lip. When he makes a move with not having any foot contact against the wall this is called campusing because he engaged into a pull up in order to release the right hand to bring it over to a match at the lip. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet. In this one, he brings the left foot that was extended on a flag to come into a high foot placement, this one at the bar where he started as the start hold. He continues to apply pressure onto that right foot that is extended, pushing against the hole until he gets to secure the left foot placement. The climber is able to bring his left hand over to the next move, this one being a vertical pinch hold. So once the climber gets to squeeze onto the hold, then he can drop the weight by extending the arm and leaning back. In doing so, the climber had gone up for that first move with the right leg extended, which was on a flag, and now he has picked up the right foot to bring it over to a match. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet, especially when making a foot placement or a foot switch. The climber places the right toe to come into contact with the foot hold, and once the climber applies sufficient pressure, then he will be able to release the left foot from its place. It was smart of the climber to send his right hand to cross over the left hand. This because it places him directly to have the grips in front of him and only had to twist the wrist in order to replace the left hand. Now the climber is underneath the hold and it's placing the fingertips on the other side of the edge by pressing with the thumbs creating almost like a chin-up position to sustain the grip. The climber was able to make the left hand up for the next hold. This one being a large lip where the climber can wrap the fingers behind the hold, this is called a jug or more like this is a long edge would be a bucket. So the climber needs to release some of the pressure at the hand to move it along to bump it over to the left side. So the climber pulls up harder in order to release some of the pressure at the hands by picking up the feet also to give momentum onto the jump for the climber in order to release some of the pressure at the hand to move it along the edge. The climber here was struggling to make the right foot placement so he engages in a very forceful pull up onto that sloper and presses down on the left foot in order to send the left hand out for the next hold. As we can see as the climber was committing into that push he lost the left foot placement so right now the climber has no contact down at the feet. This is called cutting feet and and the hope is that the climber gets to land the hand at the edge of that hold on the next move. This is a very positive hold being a jug because the climber will be able to wrap the fingers around the edge of the hold. The climber is starting at a one-hold start. He places both of the hands on the same hold. This is called matching. And he places both of the hands in the same motion, where he places the fingers above and the thumb at the bottom. That thumb will help the climber to generate power on the grip. And this is called a pinch grip, as the climber will be squeezing onto the hold to create pressure. Once the climber secures the grip, he will be able to lean back, weighing the grips. And the climber is doing a step-up start. So once the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing in the mat, then the climb will start. Since the climber was able to secure the left toe hooking onto the hold, he was able to bring up the right leg to bring it over to a match at the edge of the hold. Now this was easy because the climber had already dropped the weight by having the legs extended and now both of the legs are extended having more force for the climber to sustain the toe hook with both of them engaged. This is called a bat hang so the climber must continue to apply pressure at the feet by dropping the toe downwards. As we can see the climber was able to release the right hand and brings it over to a match at the jug. The climber chooses to release the right foot from its place by dropping the leg. This to help the climber to drop the weight over to the left toe being in place inside the hold. The climbers next hold is a rounded hold. This one has some small grooves into it. So the climber is able to place the fingertips onto those dented areas of the rounded hold. This is technically a sloper because there is no lip or edge for him to hold on to. So having contact of the skin towards the hold is necessary to create friction. We can see the climber creating this meat hooking, it's called, where he needs to maximize skin contact to surface the hold. So he will be pressing the wrist into the hold to secure the grip. The climber was able to send the right hand up for the reach. In order to do that he has extended the left leg. This is called flagging out and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place. He brings the knee to come inwards so that he is able to keep his right side towards the wall to bring his center of gravity towards the wall. This is to keep in balance his move while doing the extension. For the right hand, the climber is placing it over a lobe and is able to bring the hand placement as a pinch hold as he is able to wrap the thumb onto the other side of the hold. This one is rounded so it is important that the climber creates friction between the skin and the hold and lays low in order to transfer over the weight to the grip. The climber was able to press over on the left foot. This one being a large hold, the climber pushes the hold in order to bring his hips over to a rise. Now the climber is close to the wall and the right leg is extended with no contact against the wall on the right foot. This is called flagging so it helps the climber to transfer the weight to the highest foot being in place.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

You can tell in their bow hold that there's a lot of fluidity that's helping them get from string to string. The palace is playing with a very pronated bow hold, which is helping them get the amount of sound that they're getting at the tip of the bow. The violinist is vibrating with this finger. To get their vibrato to come through a little bit more, they can focus on having a little bit more width and more flexibility in the finger. The vinyl is picking a really great spot in the bow to play this bowing. They're able to have good strong downbows, but also get back with the upbow so it sounds a little bit more balanced. The violinist's string crossings can be smoother. As they're playing on their current string, they can start to gradually bring down the bow towards the next string so that whenever they change to a different string, it's not so much of a sudden movement. The final set is the bow on the string. This is the best way to start the sound to have a more coordinated approach. The violinist also does a really excellent job bringing in their upper arm to help them play exactly at the frog. This is allowing them to make sure that they can use their whole bow, which is really maximizing their sound. The violins are using a lot of speed and weight here to have this really impassioned sound. This is allowing them to have a deeper sound from the violin. The violinist's sound could be a little bit more open. They could have a little bit less weight and a little bit more speed. Just make sure that the string is vibrating more to get more of this ringing sound.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The Buells is doing a good job with this bow stroke. They're keeping it very close to the string. If they wanted a little bit more power, they could add a little bit more horizontalness to it so they're adding more bow. The Buells have some really efficient movement here whenever they're crossing strings. They're using minimal amount of bow to get over to the string crossing. They're also keeping the bow very close to the string so there's not any extra movement that is making it harder for them to coordinate. The stroke that the violist has is also very nice. They're keeping the bow very close to the string, and they have a nice bounce in the stick, which is allowing them to get the articulation that they want. The ULSS is doing a bunch of up bowings, going up, up, up. I feel like they should just do it as it comes down, up, down, just so it comes across more clearly. They were able to get a better sound that way. As the passage speeds up, the vules do a good job of keeping the bow very close to the string the whole time. Again, this is a section where their fingers are starting to come off the string a little bit too high, and now that they're playing faster, it's more difficult for them to keep up this tempo and to get the clarity that they need. They should try to keep their fingers as close as possible to the fingerboard. This stroke that they have, they're staying on the string, which really helps with clarity and consistency. They're also bouncing the stick as they're playing this, which is giving them that articulation that they're looking for. The viola is playing with a very straight bow, which is resulting in a very sustained and clean sound. To get full bows, the veal is utilizing their upper arm to help them get back to the frog. The violas is playing further out in the bow and using a lighter amount of weight to create this thinner sound. They could commit even more and try to play a little bit further up and use more bow speed for this character. While playing these moving notes now, the violist is using a really perfect amount of bow to help give them a little bit of length to each note, but not too much that it's hard to coordinate with the left hand playing at this tempo. The Buelles tier has a really nice stroke. They're starting from the string, which is really important for coordination and getting a very clean sound consistently. With these 16ths that they're playing, they can have a little bit more of this scrubbing motion where they get into the string a little bit more so that it's louder and comes across in the music. The violist is using a down bow ricochet. They should try to play with more flat hair so they have more of a surface to bounce off of. The first one they should just imagine like they're relaxing, then the bow will do the rest of the work. The Buells is using their first finger to pluck the string. This last chord could be worked on for intonation. The stroke for this section that the violist is using is a little bit light. They could try to pronate a little bit more, maybe even get a little bit closer to the frog, maybe even just a little bit further down to get a little bit more articulation, so there's more front to every single note. The violist is having a hard time with their left hand in this section. They should just try to play this very slowly so they know exactly where their notes are going. The violaist is now using full bows playing this melody, resulting in a very healthy sound. This chord that they're playing could be improved with frontination. They should try to play one finger at a time, usually the lower note first, and then adding the top note to that. The Buells does a really nice job with this last ricochet bowing, that they just let the stick naturally do its thing. The VLSI uses a harmonic here. If they wanted to be a little bit clearer, they could play with more flat hair and getting a little bit closer to the bridge for the harmonic. The violist is playing a legato note. They're using a very smooth bow to get a sustained sound. The violist is playing this passage in a great part of the bow. They're able to get some leverage from their arm for a lot of the string crossings, but they're not too far out into the tip where they're losing a lot of weight that sacrifices the sound. The violist uses their first finger to pluck the strings very quickly. When coming off this down bow, the fuelist removes the bow from the string. They should try to keep it on the string as much as possible so then this next note that they have will be much more clear. The Vuls is using a lot less bow and a lot less weight to create a lighter dynamic with these notes. The violist is using full bows in this section to get a very healthy, clean sound. The violist is using a full amount of bow and a good amount of weight to create this powerful sound. The puelist very frequently has flying fingers in their left hand. Whenever they have a higher finger pressed down on the string, the rest of the finger should also be down. This would overall lead to being a more efficient left hand. This is a section that when they were playing faster, the coordination got a little bit out of control. I believe this is because of the coordination with their hands. Their fingers keep flying up, so it's harder for them to coordinate and play like that long term. The violist is pronating with their right hand so that they're getting a lot of weight into the stick. This is allowing them to get a lot of power on an up bow when they're playing up at the tip. Again, this is a section where the violist has their fingers flying up as they're playing. Especially if you're playing this fast, it would be more clear if they kept their fingers closer to the fingerboard.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The kicks and the claps shouldn't be happening at the same time. Should be kick, back step, and clap. But she's kind of doing the clap and the kicks all and the steps all combined simultaneously. So she really needs to be isolating these steps in sequence when she's going back rather than doing them all together at the same time. The dancer just circled her arms downward but she didn't really finish the circle. It would be nice if she finished the circle completely so that her arms made a full revolution but she kind of cut this movement short because she's anticipating her next step. So my advice would be to finish a step fully instead of cutting it in favor of starting the next one. It will still be sequential but finish your last step before you start your next one. The dancer is sometimes focusing her eyes outward to the direction that her foot is going and sometimes focusing her eyes forward. She's capable of doing both, but what would help her here is if she did one consistently. So whether she's clearly focusing straight word or clearly focusing outward in the direction would be wonderful just to show that she is able to maintain that. When she just threw her arms out and up, kind of in a V shape, each arm was pointing to a diagonal. Her arms were good, but she could finish the line more with her hands if her hands had energy in them. Her arms had energy, but her hands were kind of not as energized. So she extends that energy from her shoulder all the way out to her fingertips. That would improve the step. She had really good control of her arms, circling them up and around, and then circling them around and back up. She kind of alternated, and she did this in perfect rhythm because she took eight counts to do it, but in the first direction, she took four counts, and in the direction coming back, she also took four counts. So they were equal, neither was favored more, and her rhythm was clear, steady on time. The dancer just bent down very low when she was moving to her right. She didn't only, oh sorry, that's to her left. When she was moving to her left, she didn't only move to her left, but she moved to her left and also moved downward at the same time. So she's combining directional pulls and this is wonderful. She's doing this purposefully, swiftly and easily. The dancer just added in a stylistic flare as she bent lower, her upper body lower when she moved her foot forward as well. This was a clear choice that she made and shows full control of her body. The dancer is getting very low here. She's able to do this because her heel is off the ground, which is allowing her to squat further and not straining her Achilles tendon. This is great. She's able to shift her weight because of basically how her feet are placed. However, here she did not shift her weight completely and we can see that her weight isn't centered and it's not pushed to her left. We could tell that because over here her right foot is down on the floor instead of her toes being up and pressed into her heel as she was in the last time she did this step. Her legs here are not as crossed as it could be. So here her left leg could really cross further more in front and her right leg could cross further more in back to execute this motion to show that she's in a clear shape and not in this in-between place. The dancer started out this routine with a lot of energy, however she has lost it a bit in terms of she has lowered her energy throughout so that this part later on in the routine does not match where she began at the start. My commentary would be to start and end with the same amount of energy to not have a decrescendo or a decreasing of energy throughout. You want to end as strong as you began. And as I mentioned before, she loses her rhythm in this step. So her arms and her leg when she's kicking and when she's clapping should not occur at the same time. They should occur at different times. So if she's ever kicking and clapping at the same time for this particular step that she's attempting to execute, she isn't coordinated the way in which the step requires. So to make her movement more efficient or more correct, she has to separate the movements between her lower body and her upper body or her leg and her hand to not be simultaneous. Her heel here was pressed into the floor and her toes are pointing up. This was really good. It showed that she changed her weight shift to her right side of her body. And we can really see that because her heel was up. So basically her weight was predominantly on her right leg. That's great. The dancer is changing direction often. She's facing all different types of directions in the room. This is wonderful for dance to be able to use every direction because dance is a 3D art. But in doing so, she needs to make sure that she's aware of where or which direction she's going when so that it's not a coincidence. And she can make her movement more crisp or more efficient by fully facing that direction. So having her shoulders, having her hips, having her head face that direction or face different directions on each other would be fine as long as it's purposeful and clear. She's kind of going back and forth between directions without entirely ever arriving at one before she hits the next one. The dancer is doing a lovely job of being lively here. She is keeping her energy upbeat as well as swinging her arms back and forth so her body movements and energy match the music. The dancer might have ran out of space here because of the way the camera is set up, but even if she is to run out of space, each of her steps, even if stationary, should be large. So in order to use the space that she has efficiently, she could have picked her knees up higher to make this step look more energized instead of kind of just an in-place step waiting on to stay in the screen or in the camera setup. So to find a different way to use her energy without stopping, one option could be to have lifted her knees on those steps. This Shorty George step, the step where she's swiveling her feet and moving forward, she's doing very well because her feet are close together. This is essential for this step. It'd be much more difficult for her to cover ground like that if her legs were instead further apart. It wouldn't be easy for her to travel forward as she is, but because her legs are together, she's able to do this with ease. When she is moving her arms upward like this, she is keeping her shoulders aligned. Her shoulders aren't going above her neck. She is not slouching. She is raising her arms well. They're extended, but her shoulders remain down when she's raising her arms. This is great. In this clap step, her arms are not organized. They're flapping a bit, but she can correct this step if she remains doing the same step, but putting extra attention and emphasis in her arms so that the clap is a clear clap and not just a consequence of her kicking her leg. The dancer is matching the intonations of the music. She moved backwards quickly when there was a lot of instruments in the music, and then she slowed down her movement going forward and backwards to align with the sounds that the music was making. This was great and demonstrated wonderful musicality. This is a much better execution of this step. Her legs are in a clear X. Here, her right leg is in front, her left leg is in back. She's using different directions here with her legs. This is clear. This is a wonderful execution of this step. And she even throws in some style points by bending her body lower. So her body's reaching towards the ground while her legs are reaching on both diagonals. The dancer is executing the Charleston step great, basically perfectly, because her ankles are rotating medially and laterally, both in and outwardly, as she moves them forward and backwards. This is an essential detail in this step, and she's doing it with ease.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

When she turns to her left, it's a little bit slower, so she can definitely try to pick up that turn as she goes to the left, just to kind of snap it around as much as she does on the right side. Here she crosses in front, she rotates her body just slightly to the corner which is nice. She's not using too much space so she could definitely step out a little bit further but she keeps it really together and still keeping the same rotation in her arms as well as a nice simple movement in her hips. So the dancer starts with a really nice energy and flow in her body. She is stepping in place and her feet are nice and light. Right here you see that her right foot, the heel, is off the floor as it should be. Her knees are bent as she steps and she has a really nice rotation in her arms and her upper body. Here she steps forward and back again same rhythm in her upper body, nice gentleness in her knees and then stepping lightly on her feet. So here she steps out.

This is a perfect recipe for a shooter to continuously miss the ball to the right side of the basket, which he does on this shot. As he releases the ball, you take a look. You can see on the shooting hand, the last two fingers that are on the ball are his index finger and also his middle finger. So with these two fingers being the last two fingers to leave the ball, that's going to create good backspin. So that means his hand placement and the release on his shooting hand are really good because those two fingers are the last two fingers to touch the ball. However, because of his feet being perfectly square like this, you can see here his elbow is still out. So with his elbow being out, that means that it's hard for us on that follow-through for the ball to be completely straight in the direction that we want it to go. Just making a slight adjustment of his feet will guarantee that the ball is going to go straight every single time. This shot right here was actually his best shot. As you can see, as he releases the ball, you see his guy hand is open towards the basket here. Like on this plane. Excuse my bad drawing. So you see a straight line here and then you see his left hand, the shooting hand, is here. So his guy hand and his left hand are separated and they're not, it didn't cross the plane on the release of the ball. And so the ball is going to go straight right down where we wanted the ball to go, straight towards the basket. This was his best shot, although it didn't go in. This was his best release and his best shot. It just went in and out. This was a good shot. This is what is known as a good miss, even though he missed the shot, the follow through and the release of the ball was really, really good. He still has things he needs to clean up with his feet as far as having the proper spacing and having his left foot in front. But this release right here was his best release. on this shot he was able to fight the urge for the ball, for his arm to come out so much to the right side. It's still going a little bit to the right but it's not nearly as much as it was on the previous shots and because of that this shot because his arm didn't go so far to the right the ball on the release was more straight. Now the issue with this particular shot was he shot it too strong so he put too much power into it so although it was straight it hit the backboard too hard and we missed the shot. Taking a look at his footwork, his feet are perfectly lined up next to each other. Because of this, his left elbow, which is his shooting hand, is pointing at a slant, which means his left elbow is pointing out and away from the basket. As a left-handed shooter, you want your left foot to be slightly in front of the right foot. So now if his right foot is slightly in front, this will change the angle of his arm to this, to more of a straight down effect, and his elbow is more in line with the basket. So we want to make sure that the placement of our feet are correct. Also if you take a look at his feet, his feet are so close together, as he bends down, his knees are over his toes. This lets you know that his feet are too close together, because as he bends down for this motion, his knees shouldn't be crossed over his toes. His knees shouldn't be over his toes if he draws a straight line down like that. So he needs to spread his legs, have his feet a little bit wider apart, so when he bends down his knees do not go over his toes. So when he bends down, his knees should actually be behind his toes instead of over the front of his toes, like it is on this shot attempt. Again, releases the ball. His arm is at this trajectory going to the right. The ball again is going to miss to the right side of the basket. You see here after the release of the ball as he holds up his follow-through, you can see his left arm, his shooting arm, has crossed the plane and is actually on the right side of the ball after the release. So he releases the ball and he's moving the ball, moving his arm as he releases it to the right side of the basket. So with this action with his arm, he's creating momentum high over slight that as the ball is traveling towards the basket, excuse me, as the ball is traveling towards the basket here, it is actually slightly moving to the right because of this action of his arm as he releases it, the arm is moving to the right. So the momentum is actually pushing the ball to the right. So his elbow being out and moving his shooting arm across his body to the right side means that more often than not, he has the tendency of missing to the right side of the basket on his shot. We take a look at his hand placement on the ball. He actually has really good hand placement. As you can see, the left index finger, which is his shooting hand, is right there in the middle of the ball. So this is good placement of his left hand on the ball. And his right hand, which is his guy hand, is on the side of the ball. So he has really good hand placement as he goes into this shot.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Let me see him kind of swap positions, get nice and opposite pose. He's got a left hand on, right foot on. This left foot kind of smears into the wall. He's kind of doing almost a twist lock technique, so he's kind of going to twist into this arm. He's not doing it fully, but he's setting up like it. So this should let him do is get his weight over that right foot, twist in, get that right hip into the wall, and be able to extend off that hip and drive himself up the wall. So you can see he's starting, he's kind of keeping his arms nice and tensioned but straight. He's kind of really sinking into these feet. And one interesting thing is he's starting with this kind of heel hook on his left. So he's going to kind of post with the right and heel hook with the left. It's probably because maybe the more positive side of the hold is facing that direction. And then on his way back in he kind of lets go and then just falls off the wall. So it's hard to say what happened here, but I think by pausing and taking time to better establish and set up for the jump, it could be pretty beneficial kind of taking that jump to the legs instead of the arms. And it seems like he kind of just goes to the dyno. It seems like he might have been able to kind of sink back in. It seems like most of the effort for the dyno was in his arms. He didn't really drive with his feet. He does hit the hole and he hits it pretty square on. It looks like he's got a good grip, but for whatever reason, he's just not able to hold it. That heel hook, what it does is kind of lets him pull over with that left foot. So he has to do less with his arms. And he can kind of create that tension with his leg to kind of pull himself to the left.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So again, well-rounded, very skilled. As the video comes to an end, we see there were two consecutive sequences of touches, which is a very decent amount, meaning the ball was just dropped one time in nearly two and a half minutes. This second sequence was 76 plus touches. First sequence was about 130 plus touches. So again, high proficiency here, very impressive mixture of different surfaces, different weights, and most importantly, keeping the ball in the air for long periods of time. After over 130 consecutive touches we have our first ball drop, also after 90 seconds. An impressive inside to inside to outside combination here thrown in by the player. Just again to touch on variety of surfaces of the body being used here We've just seen some good alternating quad touches shown against some well-rounded proficiency here in juggling the ball As we can see, the ball has come from a height, but those previous couple of touches have been about hip height consistently, so it's a good save from the player and again, good control on the juggles. Three outside of the foot touches linked together in a row. Again, not easy. some consistently low height and low weight touches made look easy by the player here in this sequence again just showing that higher proficiency being able to make not an easy skill look pretty easy and in a casual manner here again suggesting that this player is towards the higher end of the scale here Another impressive touch here, so as we highlight in the last one, a high ball came down, it was taken on the chest. There was one touch after the chest touch and then this one was the follow-up touch, which continued to keep the ball in the air and to keep the touch sequence increasing. So again, high proficiency shown here, very impressive skills from this juggler. In this video we are going to be looking at juggling or as named in other countries Volleying so juggles or volleys some of the criteria that I'm going to be judging this will be The number of juggles in a row and the touch chains So are we seeing many touches many juggles in a row without the ball being dropped? The number of times the ball is dropped overall in the video will have an indication as well On the proficiency from there the variety of the parts of the feet and the body that are used to keep the ball in the air, so Is the player just using one part of one foot because that's what they're strongest with or are they using Many different parts of both feet are using their quads Are they taking some touches maybe on a chest or the head to keep the ball from touching the floor? So that would be some of the stuff that we will be looking at to The height of the juggles or the touches Are they consistent or are they going higher and higher and having a negative knock-on effect? Where it's causing the ball now to be losing control and dropping onto the floor consistently We'll be looking at the readjustment of the feet and the stance of the player that is juggling the ball. So are they readjusting that standing foot before they take a juggle or are they staying planted and allowing themselves to be off balance which is going to have a negative knock-on effect to the amount of juggles that they do and the amount of touches they can kind of string together to keep the ball in the air and Then lastly just the consistent weight of the touch. So is there a consistency? And is there a well controlled weight on the touches to keep the ball from not going too high and to keep it controllable? So we will try to mention and point out some of these things Throughout the video and that will hopefully then lead us to our proficiency score towards the end So just about two minutes in, we've still just had only one drop within our second sequence, our combination of touches here, and we can still see the players comfortable alternating the sides and switching up the different parts of the feet, so the insides, the outsides, also the use of the quads to readjust the weight of the touches to take some momentum out of the ball where needed or to add momentum in also where needed, and the players again show an impressive mixture of weight, height and surfaces used. Being over a minute into the video here, there still has been no drop of the ball. The ball has not touched the floor since the start of the sequence. The player is readjusting his stance well, and the consistency of the touch weight is improving as the ball is staying consistently lower, which is obviously helping the player to achieve a high amount of touches in a row. So here we're seeing some good chest control. So we're taking the ball here on the chest from a very high ball somewhere up around this height or higher. For that to come down from such a height and to be controlled on the chest is not a very easy technique. So again towards the higher side of the proficiency scale with this touch. We are seeing some good alternating feet sequences with variety of parts of the foot being used. As we can see here, the outside of the foot is being used, the knee is going inwards, a little twist in the hip, the foot is coming towards the outside and twisting out from the knee out here. And the outside of the foot is connecting with the bottom of the ball to bring it up in the air. This is not an easy technique at all, especially one to follow up from to keep the ball in the air. So, showing some high level proficiency here early on in the video. Early on we are seeing a mixture in the height of the touches, but it looks like the player has good touch weight control to take some momentum out of the ball as it comes down from a greater height. As we can see on the screen, ball is up high, the player is looking up here, in this angle here and we can see obviously the ball is up towards the sky in the left hand side screen here but what the player can do well is when the ball is coming down from such a height here it has obviously got more speed so it is going to be harder to redirect that ball up with that extra momentum. However the player does have good weight control to redirect that ball, it's not just a higher touch upon a higher touch upon a higher touch or the touch is coming down and it is being redirected outwards or to the side so the player is able to redirect the ball consistently up regardless of the height that it is coming down from they can again redirect it to a comfortable height to readjust their body and continue to juggle and keep the ball from touching the floor.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Again, nice slight bend in the knees. I definitely think she can move her hips a little bit more in this movement as well as the shoulders. But she does reach the arms out and extend those really nicely. So here she steps forward, definitely want to bend this front knee so it's not so straight, and stepping on the ball of the foot as she steps forward, and also remembering to really rotate and move those arms around from the back. So overall, really lovely job with this one. Just a few minor technical corrections, but overall, really great job. So here, nice job getting the right leg around and planted on the floor here. Her left leg is slightly bent with its ball of the foot on the floor, so all of her weight is on her right leg. Arms are extended up and she is swiveling and rolling her body around in this part really well. So here the dancer starts stepping in two steps in place and then stepping out and sliding to the side. Here she stepped out on her right leg. Definitely I think can bend this knee a bit more and really extend this leg out a little bit more. But nice job keeping the arms straight. I do think her eyes can follow her hand a bit more. So turning that head all the way to the side. So here, really nice pose position. This right knee is bent and the foot is flat on the floor. Left leg is extended out with the toe pointed. Nice job there. The arm is extended out. This left arm is crossed over and the eyes are straight forward. So really nice full line in the body for this position. So here she spins around, I stop getting the arms up and extended over the head, getting around in her spot. Again, as she turns, keeping the knees bent so that way she stays nice and grounded to the floor. So here she walks side to side and then twist around. She again is drawing that arm around and the eyes are in line with the hand. Definitely want to keep the knees bent in this so as she pivots to turn to face the other way, it's more of a pivot and less of a slide going side to side.

The dancer is looking downward and she sees the floor in her view. The dancer is looking downward again here to the floor and her hands. She needs to be looking straight ahead. Also, her feet are now placed in a bit of an awkward position with both feet pointed inwardly in a crossing position, meaning that her hip is too rotated inward. The dancer was meant to take three steps forward crossing and this third step with her right foot she doesn't finish completely. The dancer moves her weight onto her toes so that she's able to twist right and left. The dancer's arm here can be extended further down so that when she's swiping it in a swoop across from the left side of the room to the right side of the room it has more energy and looks like it's placed more properly. Instead, she should lift her focus upward and look straight ahead. However, she should be lifting her heels even higher on both her right and her left foot. That would improve the movement and give her more mobility and more foot articulation.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

They should try to have more of a curved hand so that when they're moving from one note to another, they can move more of their arm and just type with their fingers. They're still testing out some notes to figure out which position their hands need to be to start the piece. You can also see that the pianist is playing with flat fingers, which is not really getting in the way right now because she's not playing super fast, but it would be easier for her to be able to read and play if they use the fingertips. The pianist is still trying to play the very first measure of the piece. They clearly need to practice more. It'd be good for them just to make sure that they're practiced frequently so they become more familiar with the keyboard and how to play. The pianist keeps on making a lot of mistakes. They choose to keep on starting over the piece. This is clearly a beginner playing the piano. They're still trying to acclimate themselves with the keys and know where they're going and reading music. It'd be best for them to isolate each hand and practice those individually until they feel comfortable with each of those lines and then bring them together. The pianist plays a wrong note. You can see that their hands are quite far away, so whenever they're playing they're using the very pad of their finger while their finger is also really extended. I don't think this is helping them get around the keyboard at this point. They can try to make sure that they're in a position that more notes are available to their hand if they wanted to extend and play. The pianist is stopping frequently to see which notes to play next. They're trying to find the correct position for their left hand. The pianist plays the first few notes and then stops to see what the next ones are.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He's hitting the hold, he just needs to hit a little higher so he can get both hands on and kind of control that swing. So here we can see as he is at the apex of his jump, you can see he's maybe just a little bit short. But overall he's moving in a good direction, kind of close to the wall.

He's going to have to kind of pull in with this left hand even harder, really lash and hold that right arm. So overall, just maybe keep a little bit more tension. And one kind of by position thing it looks like he is kind of doing this first move all upper body I think what I like to see is kind of this knee kind of shift more left and have this whole body kind of shift More left so that way you could kind of cut just pull straight up and keep the tension And set kind of coming at it from an angle So here you can see him pulling on to a into a pretty good starting position. His arms are nice and straight You know really nice actively pinching on this big kind of block hold He hasn't taken his right foot off. So he hasn't isn't fully Settled into the starting position yet But overall kind of the only thing notice I think would be is kind of maybe dropping down to the left a little bit. You can see he isn't really hanging plumb from this hold So he's still kind of pushing himself up a little bit So I think that'd be the only adjustment is to start into that especially on pinches Where it's like if you kind of start and then lose your You know, it's gonna be easier to start in a good position on pinches then start and then kind of fall into the better position So we kind of want to start from a good position right away And then this kind of foot swap, so he does do this foot swap to get opposite of po. So he's now got left hand, right foot. But the way that he kind of swaps the feet is kind of jumpy. That kind of looks like it sucks his tension in his core a little bit. Not only that, but his left foot now is kind of just swinging open. You can kind of see his hips are kind of falling back away. So I think kind of cleaning up this left leg, kind of having it kind of flag and toe into the wall, provide a little bit of extra tension support, would be huge. Then kind of right off the bat, he kind of like readjusts this left foot. I think that might be from having to kind of drop into it. But you can see he's still kind of out on this hold. So kind of letting himself sink down and really get comfortable on that left foot and kind of bounce out because his right foot kind of looks like it's bending back and that's going to kind of cause his weight to kind of pull back away from the wall, which especially on pinches, you're going to have to grip extra hard and kind of pull yourself back in. That's going to be really unforgiving with these kind of style holds.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And take a look at the top portion of the square. You can see that it is just below the top portion of the square. So since she was able to place the ball in this location on the backboard, it was able to bounce off of the backboard and go nicely in the basket for the made layup. After she makes the layup on the right side of the basket, she allows, and the ball goes through the net, she allows the ball to hit the ground. When we're performing a mic-in drill, and the ball goes through the net, we want to be in position where we can catch the ball as the ball comes through the net with the proper footwork, and we never allow the ball to hit the ground. The player here is demonstrating the mic and drill where you jump off of two feet and after she makes the layup on the left side of the basket, as the ball comes through the net, she catches the ball and allows the ball to drop down to the level of her waist. When we're doing the mic and drill and we catch her and we get the rebound out of the net after a made layup, we do not want to allow the ball to drop down to the level of our waist. We want to keep the ball high near our upper chest or neck area while performing the mic and drill. After she makes the layup on the right side of the basket, and the ball goes through the net, she catches the ball, and as she catches the ball, she steps to the left side of the basket with her left foot first, and then she's going to pick up her right foot and place her right foot closer to her left foot in order to square herself up to the basket, and then she's going to jump off of two feet to shoot the ball with her left hand off of the backboard and into the basket. This is the incorrect footwork for doing a Mike and Drew when we go to the left side of the basket. When we go to the left side of the basket, we want to first step with our right foot to the left side of the basket, so we'll step with the right foot on the left side of the basket for step one, and then we'll swing our left foot around to square ourselves up for step two. So now that our right foot is here and our left foot is here, we can jump off of two feet and shoot the ball with our left hand off of the backboard and into the basket.

This is the incorrect footwork for the Mikan drill. As the ball comes through the net and we get the rebound, we want to step to the right side of the basket with our left foot first.

They throw for the hold and they're able to control it, but it takes a lot of energy because it's a very aggressive way to do this move. And then they place the heel up afterwards. The hands are actually a little backwards looking now. Ideally, they'd have the left hand on the left side. So this may be a difficult position to escape. So climbers kind of sprinting through from the start, but they do begin in a good position. That left hand-foot match allows them to move the left hand into this hold without cutting feet, which saves energy. Anytime both feet are off the wall and they have to swing themselves back on is usually a drain. Yeah, and as a result, they fall, their hand kind of pushes the other one off the wall. So we see the climber really struggling to understand how to use this hold and as a result, they keep swapping feet and changing hip position. If they want to lay back on it, it really would work to have the right foot in but because the next hold is this kind of block shaped pinch, it's hard to use so they don't want to commit to it. Ideal beta would likely be a high right heel and that lets them flag the left foot and just cross up and over into it. But right now they just seem hesitant and unwilling to commit to any beta.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I'd do a seven, no I'd do an eight. He was great form, made probably 60% of them. And I would bet he's a better shooter than that, so eight. So we see as he goes up, kind of before the knee bend, nice dip here. He's starting it right around the waist. Something that could probably bump his score up a little bit is having his knees already bent, so he's got kind of the full body fluidity going up with the dip. So he's going to his release. Great job. His right foot slightly in front, knees at a good level of bent. He's got his left hand guiding and his right hand in front of his face. Ready to release. Nice high release. Good job. Yeah, I like his approach to his footwork on the catch. It's kind of just closing the gate. So basically he has the right foot out open, just closing it by bringing his right foot forward, which is nice. It's honestly quicker than a left-right, but it's a little harder to do on the move. Good, so it's free throw, so he's got a little bit of lift, which is all you need. Over here on the left, the ego view, great follow through here. He's got the wrist bend, which is perfect, we want the left hand not doing a lot of work, kind of just guiding the ball.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

As we shift our attention to the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player's follow-through release hand is rotated slightly towards the right, giving the five fingers pointing towards the rim, allowing the ball the right amount of spin to be able to hit our targeted area, the top right corner of the box on the backboard, giving it a proper angle to be able to get above the rim and drop through the net in a completed layup attempt. As we look at this layup attempt on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player gave the ball the right amount of spin to be able to hover around our targeted area, which is the top right corner on the box of the backboard. However, we can notice that the ball hits more towards the middle of the box, not allowing it to get the proper angle it needs to be able to drop through the net. Instead, the angle was able to hit the side of the rim and bounce out, causing a missed layup attempt. As we focus our attention on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player's follow through release hand is rotated towards the right, having the five fingers point towards the rim. However, the offensive player did not give the ball the right amount of spin to be able to hit our targeted area, which is the right corner, top right corner of the box on the backboard. Instead, the ball's target is on the top of the backboard, which does not give it the proper angle it needs to drop through the rim. Thank you. As we look back on the right side of the frame, we can notice that the player does really well at locating its target area before going into his jumping motion. A few minor adjustments we will want to make for the player is to not have the player take off so late. Taking off where the player is at currently, may not give him the amount of space he needs to do his reverse layup. If the player takes off a step earlier, he will have more room to operate and will be less likely to find himself under the rim, making it a more difficult layup attempt. As we watch the layup attempt on the right side of the frame, again, the player has the correct footwork of initially starting with his right foot and jumping off his left leg. Again, we will want to bring the ball placement position higher towards his shoulders to prevent exposing the ball to the defense to allow them an opportunity of stripping the ball and causing an offensive turnover for the player. As we look at this player's finished attempt on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the ball is hovering around our targeted area, which is the top right corner of the box on the backboard. The ball landed more towards the middle area of the box, not allowing it the proper angle to be able to drop through the net. Instead, it gave it an angle where the ball hits the rim and will be missed off the rim and result in an incomplete reverse layup. As we look at this player's layup attempt, on the right side of the frame, again, we will want to bring the ball placement position to be higher above his shoulders, way above his shoulders, to be able to prevent the defense from having an easy access of stripping the ball and causing an offensive turnover. This will also help the player finish more efficiently in comparison of having the ball placement position closer towards the rim compared to it being lower towards the ground. As we observe this player's attempt on his right-handed reverse layup, we can notice on the right side of the frame that he has the correct footwork. He starts out initially by stepping with his right foot first, and then landing with his left foot second, which is going to be his jumping leg, into the right-handed reverse layup. On this attempt for the player to right-hand a reverse layup, on the left side of the frame, we can notice that his follow-through extension hand was rotated towards the right, having the five fingers point towards the rim. The player on this attempt gave the ball the right amount of spin to be able to hit our targeted area, which is the right corner on the top of the box on the backboard, to be able to create a proper angle to be able to drop through the net. As we look at this player's attempt on the right side of the frame, we will want the player's body position to be a bit lowered towards the ground to help create more balance, more power, and more explosiveness on his drive towards the rim. This will also help to prevent defenders from having easy access of knocking the offensive player off his balance while initiating contact. A few minor adjustments we will want to make to help improve the player's efficiency on his layup. On the right side of the frame, we will want to bring the ball placement position higher towards his shoulders area.

Here she's now stepping to her right side, but she does a really nice, clean, just subtle release of the back. So when she steps out, her back is kind of rolling and then her arms are placed nicely in front. And the next part when she taps her knee it's right on the beat the drum beat that you hear and then really nice windmill arms they are extending all the way up and down and they flow all the way around her body and she's spinning them from her shoulder which is nice because then you get the full range of motion in the arms. This is a really, really great performance. Definitely give this one a 10. I didn't see really any issues with it. She kept her energy up. You can just see in her face and some people may think the face is not important, but in dance it definitely can change the mood of the entire piece. So if you're happy and moving and filled with energy, the audience will also feed off of that. So not forgetting that your full body is performing and dancing. And it can definitely affect the rest of your body as well. So even if she did mess up, I couldn't tell. She stayed on the beat. She kept moving and just improvised if she needed to. But really, really nice job with this one. From the beginning, the dancer has a really nice, strong presence. She is smiling, she looks happy, she looks like she's enjoying herself. What I did notice in the beginning is her arms are full out with the kick and the twist. She was able to really control her body, controlling her balance, especially when she did the quick half turn and then pause. So everything was just really nicely in alignment for this hearse eight counts. Here, another nice moment, really nice ronde jambe with that leg going around her body. Those arms are really nice spread out to the fingertips. Her face is there, nice front and facing forward for the audience. Just a really nice moment. In this bin, she is spotting the sides, which is nice, a nice change in direction. But she does a really good job whipping her head around very quickly so that way she gets around and then once she's around, she is not dizzy. So for the next take out, she again does a really, really good job. They really don't have many notes or any notes. Just her energy looks great. I love the head roll. It's nice and full. She's facing forward. And her feet are nicely planted on the floor.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I feel like this whole area is very tight and there's not a lot of isolation, not a lot of fluidity. So I would encourage the dancer to bring that in. For any dancer to be more fluid and to release, dancing and moving is about being free and opening the body up. So we want to not hold back and really open up. The dancer must release more in the arms and lift them up a little bit. Right now the arms are tight to the chest and the dancer is moving them in this circular fashion rather than swinging them this way from back to front alongside the body. The dancer's arm should be stretched and extended, and maybe not a bald fist, as if the dancer is punching the wall, but the dance. So it's really just extending the arm forward in the choreographic movement. The dancer takes really big steps front and back. I'd like to see a variation between the steps. So maybe it's one, two, three, and one, two, three, one, two, three, so sustain that third one.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And after getting this right hand here, the climber matches feet and gets the right foot up on the right hand start hold, that sharp end cut crimp, and they're able to go up and lift into this hold, and here they are matching it. And then maintaining this core tension through the right foot here, you see they're kind of bending their knee in. It's a bit easier to lock the leg out when you bend it in. It's not the best technique because it avoids using the hamstring. You want to keep those strong. But turning the knee like this does make it a little easier to lock out. You do get to use the side of your core here. And so yeah, the climber kind of sags into this tension and then is able to come in and match the finish hold. We have the start of this boulder, a good shot of the right hand. You can see, I would either call this a sharp end cut or a mini jug. It's probably more on the sharp end cut side where you're kind of crimping. You can kind of see the flat digit and then it comes up, goes down. It looks like they're kind of pinching it here, but I wouldn't be surprised if as they pull on they take this thumb and even wrap it over and do a full crimp. And then the left hand is a similar hold. The climber is then able to just sag in on this right foot, straighten out the left arm, and come in for this match here. This is a pretty good crimp. I have this crimp on my spray wall. As a foot, you're able to pull really hard away from the hold in this direction. That's what's enabling the climber to keep their hips to the right. This match kind of works with no other foot because you can hold that opposition with just the right. Then after matching, they're able to come out left hand to this pink hold here. After this match, the climber gets the left foot on the left hand start hold, then comes out and tags an intermediate with the left hand, and then that allows the climber to actually get these hips a little further left into the wall, and also get into a more comfortable lock off position in the right hand. And here they are, pouncing up and left into this little mini jug about halfway up the wall. And standing tall off the foot on the kicker, the climber is able to lock down this left arm. And the climber is also smearing with the left foot on the kicker, so it's not on a foot but it's using the surface of the kicker.

I would encourage both dancers to ground through their pelvis so they have more fluidity in their movement and ability to transition faster. Because the dance is so slow, those attention to details in the arms and in the feet are really important. I like to think about creating statues, so every movement should be like a flowing statue through it. So it looks clean and precise. Right now it looks a little sloppy, and I know that's not the intention of the dancer. So I think really being precise about pathway of arms, about using that undercurve, about having that hip articulation and grounding through the feet. All of these basic elements of dance through space, time, and energy will help increase the overall proficiency and look and feel of the dance. I would encourage these dancers to think about frame. So how are they holding each other up, right? Where should the arm, both arms be when they're connected and creating this frame? Oftentimes, the dancers rotate on what part of their foot they're on. So really thinking about should they be on the ball of the foot versus whole foot and making sure that there's clarity in that. Especially in partner dance, it's really important to have power and strength through the arms, even the arms that's not connected. So thinking about the pathway of arms and the precision of movement will help increase the overall look and feel of this dance and its overall proficiency score. I would encourage the dancers to really use this. This is very an important tool in partnering, right? Especially if you're pulling or pushing or leading a partner, that arm and that giving of power or taking of weight show, tells the dancer where to go. So that has to be a lot stronger to be able to execute partner choreography.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So as he kind of goes up to this, he's going to be going without the force of that left foot, which won't be as nice as if he could keep both those feet on and keep that tension and keep that balance. And, you know, especially when he hits that end move, you'll have just one more point of contact, kind of holding and pulling his hips closer to the wall, keeping his core engaged and his tension there. So he has able to utilize that heel hook to really pull down through that heel almost create a third arm. So instead of having to push and kind of drive the speed, he was able to kind of set that heel on there and really pull down and really utilize his legs to kind of pull himself up the wall and take all that tension, especially on a hold like that where it's so big, so flat, it just makes sense to, you know, put your heel on something that has a large surface area. So overall again starts pretty similar to last time. Nice straight arms but again this left knee is kind of on the inside of the arm and so I think just being let it get out onto the left side of the arm so that way you can kind of come up and rotate and move as far left as it needs to. I can't really see what the right foot is doing. It looks like it's toned down to something. Here might be a little smart of me to put it down onto the to the kicker so that we can kind of push more and kind of push that weight over that left foot just to kind of get his hip set up more towards the left. You can see as he's at the apex of this reach, you can see his hips and his body almost falling back and losing a little bit of tension. So I think this is his first mistake. He places this left foot over here, but he doesn't really look at it while he places it, so I'm not sure how good the placement is. And when he does make the try to make the dead point move up here, that is that left foot that blows. So I think spending a little more time getting the right position, especially here where arguably the feet are going to be more determined of your success than maybe your arms. You know, your arms have to kind of propel you into the wall, but it's like your feet that are going to kind of drive and keep the tension to this high handle. So we want to just make sure that our feet aren't as good of positions as possible. Now again, ops for the high heel, right heel to the right hand match. But kind of seems to be almost rushing it, kind of drops the tension off his left foot a little bit early. Just making kind of this right hand up and over a little bit awkward. There he's just rushing a little bit, maybe his hand position's a little bit off, but it is quite a good hold. You can see on the left it's a pretty big chug. Everything just feels a little bit rushed, he's not in as nice of a position, which is maybe adding a little bit more effort to each move, making every move just a little bit more awkward.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

I would encourage this dancer to have more attack or hustle to move quicker because it seems like they're dancing behind the music so they're always like two seconds late to the movement. So really over anticipating and having a little bit more hustle in the steps, moving faster. The dancer is struggling, or seems to be struggling to find the rhythm. I would encourage them to do some deep thinking about and listening and studying of the music so they can stay on the beat and on the rhythm. I would encourage the dancer to think about precision and having more being very precise about where they place their arms and feet and hand and where they're looking being very clear about where they're going each second of the dance. I would encourage the dancer to spot, so look one direction and whip that head around quickly to be able to do these steps, step, turn, step, step, step, turn, step, so they can actually swing and kind of make these circle pathways on the floor with more efficiency. I would encourage them to plie or bend their legs and then also throw their weight into the hip or the direction that they want to lean into so they can travel quickly, fastly, faster, and also kind of make these circles with efficiency and agility because they're working from this kind of grounded position.

The left hand fingers are curved. You can also see it from this angle over here. Now the violinist is performing a third piece. Their intonation could be improved when playing the higher pitch in this phrase with the pinky. It could help to practice that particular pitch with a tuner while adjusting the pinky's position on the fingerboard as needed. Here you can see the right hand position is looking good. The right hand fingers are curved or rounded and relaxed while bowing. Here the violinist concluded their piece with a very soft dynamic level and a long legato note. Here the phrases that were played at the beginning of the piece return and the violinist is maintaining a steady playing speed. The violinist is demonstrating good intonation when they are shifting to the higher pitches on the fingerboard. Again here, one of the pitches intonation was off. It would help to practice this phrase one note at a time while using a tuner and watching the left hand finger positioning on the fingerboard to improve the accuracy of each pitch's intonation. Here there was a bit of a squeaky sound quality to one of the pitches that was played in this phrase. It would help when practicing this phrase to keep an eye on the bow, make sure the bow is angled correctly, and that the weight is distributed evenly on the string that is needed to play this particular pitch. They are continuing to shift to the higher pitches on the fingerboard with ease. Here the rhythms in the piece are becoming more challenging and the violinist is still maintaining their tempo and playing with accuracy. Here the violinist has a great sound quality, great tone. They are playing more legato or smooth held notes and they are using vibrato. Overall, throughout this second piece, the violinists demonstrated a great sound quality due to their proper bow hold and technique, their left hand fingers being curved and accurate when playing each pitch, and they maintained a steady playing tempo or speed throughout. The violinist is now performing a second piece. They have begun their piece and are maintaining great accuracy with pitch and rhythm and a clear sound quality. Here the violinist is getting a nice loud full quality to their playing You can see them using a smooth bowing technique and they are putting more weight in the bow to achieve this kind of sound It would help to practice this particular phrase in the piece multiple times at a slower tempo to gain more confidence with the pitches, better intonation, and a clearer sound quality to this phrase. Here after shifting back down the fingerboard one of the pitches intonation was a bit off. It would help to practice this phrase at a slow tempo while listening to intonation using a tuner and watching the left hand finger positioning after shifting back to home position.

In this position we can see that the clamber was hanging on with the left hand. They do have a right foot just underneath their body right here. So this is a good starting position to see with their left hand and right foot because it does allow the clamber to really rotate and pivot naturally. So in this case the clamber would bring the right side of the body closer to the wall and this helps with the movement overall. The one thing I am noticing though is that what she is doing with her left flagging foot. So we can see that her left flagging foot is now getting kicked up and into the air right here. So I do know it's her flagging foot is kind of around the corner of the wall which can be a little awkward to maintain. But by showing me that the clamber is kind of kicking her leg up in the air right here that's showing me that the clamber is focusing on trying to generate her power with that flagging foot there and in that kicking motion. But by doing that it does kind of create an area where she loses control of her movements just because there is so much going on with that leg at that time. So if the clamber had a harder time grabbing onto that right hand hold that kicking foot would probably cause her to fall off the wall. So I would definitely encourage the clamber to really focus on keeping that leg in a static way or just pressed up against the wall in a certain direction from the beginning of the move all the way to the end of the move. So then that way that flagging foot doesn't take away from her movement. And so here's another instance of the climber trying to figure out what to do with her next movement here. But with the flagging foot, which is going to be this right foot now in this case because she was able to switch her feet, we can see that the flagging foot is kind of in a bent position now. So this is again kind of something that we don't really want to see just because with this bent leg, it does pull her body away from the wall. And it does seem like she's having a little bit of difficulty in hanging on to that right hand. So a better way to kind of engage that flagging foot is kind of get it in a much straighter position kind of pressed up against the wall. So you kind of create a lot of tension within your lower body and by creating this tension, it helps to go up into your hip where a lot of your body weight is going to be placed. So then that way you have more opportunity to place your body weight amongst your legs as opposed to your upper body, especially in this case when her hand is in a much difficult hold to grab onto.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Looking at the right side of the frame on our player's release, we can notice that the player does really well at getting his follow through and shooting hand extended above his shoulder to allow the ball to gain the proper arc and accuracy it needs to get above the rim. The player also does a good job of getting a slight lift off the ground, again helping the ball gain more momentum and power it needs. Looking at the player in the right frame, we can notice that he does very well in his attempted jump shot by getting his fall through and shooting hand extended above his shoulder allowing the ball to gain the right amount of power, arc, and accuracy it needs to travel above the rim, developing the proper angle of dropping inside the rim. He also does a really good job of getting a slight lift off the ground by jumping on his shot, again allowing the ball to gain some momentum, arc, and accuracy to get above the rim. As a result from the player's attempted jump shot, we can notice that the ball and the player provided the right amount of arc, accuracy, and rotation it needed to drop inside the rim, resulting in a completed attempted jump shot. Looking at the player's body's momentum, he does a good job jumping forward, allowing himself to land straight up and down, giving the ball a better opportunity of traveling above the rim, developing the proper angle of going inside the rim. Looking at the release of the player on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player again does well at snapping his wrist and follow through downward towards the direction of the rim, allowing the ball to travel towards the accurate alignment it needs, giving it a higher opportunity of dropping inside the rim. Looking on the left side of the frame as our player is going into his shooting motion on his attempted jump shot, we can notice that the player does really well at getting his hand underneath the ball, allowing and creating more ball control going into the release. Also having his guide hand and left hand on the side of the ball, using it as a placeholder, having no effect on the release. Looking at the player going into his attempted jump shot on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player does well using his shooting hand, getting underneath the ball, allowing more ball control on the release, and also as we look on the right side of the frame, he does well getting his ball placement position above his shoulder, allowing a higher arc on the release, and also does well at loading his legs, getting in a squatted position, allowing the player to get more lift and arc on his release. Looking at the right frame as the player is going into his release, we can notice that the player does really well at getting his ball placement position high above his shoulder to allow a higher release for the ball to travel and gain momentum to get above the rim. The player also does a great job at loading and bending his legs going into his shooting motion, again allowing the ball to create some momentum and power and arc it needs to get above the rim, traveling accurately towards the right target area. Looking at the player going into his attempted jump shot on the right frame, we can notice that the player does well using the proper footwork by stepping initially with his left foot first and having his right foot come down going into his shooting motion. Looking at the release of the player's attempted jump shot on the left side of the frame, we can notice that the player does a good job getting his follow through and wrist snapping downward towards the direction of the rim, allowing the ball to travel towards the accurate alignment it needs, giving it an opportunity of dropping inside the rim. The player also does a good job with his guide hand, allowing it to be used just as a placeholder, keeping the ball in the correct alignment before the release and having no effect on the release.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

You can make his movement more fluid in this particular step by leading with his toe and putting his weight onto his toe instead of onto his heel. The dancer has been looking down. His focus has been on to the floor and that changes the shape of his spine because then his head is tilted forward. So he should be looking instead straight on to the screen. The dancer is stomping down very heavily. He would benefit from being a bit more fluid. It's great that he has so much energy, but he can transfer this energy to his hips so that the movement is a bit smoother. It's great that the dancer strikes this final pose when he finishes his routine. I wish he was not looking downward in this pose. He would seem more confident and putting a punctuation mark at the end of his routine if he was looking straight forward. Also, if he extended his right arm further up, which would also make him look taller between those both things of looking forward and extending his arm straight up. Finally, he could hold this pose for a longer period of time just to announce that he is officially done. The dancer again is standing compacted. It's making him appear to be shorter and this is also making his movement more rigid. He can make his movement more smooth if he extended upward from his spine, from the his coccyx bone, from the base of his spine all the way upward. But what also can help him in this particular movement be less stiff and more fluid is if he brought his shoulder blades downward. His arms can still be in front of him as they are with elbows bent but just releasing his shoulders downward more would create space for his neck. Right now we don't see his neck because his spine is crunched with his shoulder blades up so just moving his shoulder blades down and extending his head upward would create more room and make him his movement look more fluid. Again, the dancer has amazing energy in his upper body. He was alternating which hand he had forward. The hand that he had forward was opposite of his leg, so if his right leg was forward, then his left arm was forward, and that was great energy. What I wish the dancer would also do is move this energy downward into his hips as well. The dancer is opening his feet once in a while here, sometimes not always on the same count. This is a bit careless, his feet should be together. It's okay if they're not glued completely together, but he's purposefully stepping outward sometimes, and he either has to fully step outward, which would be a different salsa step. That step is a basic side or side basic, or also called a Cuban, but what he's doing here is just a salsa step in place, so his feet shouldn't be opening, they should be consistently closed. Again, the dancer is looking down, but not only that, him looking down is also making his body more compact. And the ideal would be if he stood taller, and a way that he can stand taller in his full verticality for however many inches of height he has, is if he pulls upward from his head towards the ceiling, just lifting from his neck through his spine upward. What also can help the dancer step less heavily is if he transfers his weight onto his toes so he'd be light on his feet. Right now he's standing flat footed with his feet flat on the ground and that's part of the reason why he's stomping down so heavily. The dancer has great energy in his chest, but he doesn't have much energy in his hips. His hips should also be moving every time he's stepping with one foot. His hips should be moving in a backwards diagonal, horizontally backwards to the side. Right now, he has great energy in his upper body, but he's not transferring that also to his hips.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

If you look on the left side, her attention is all out the room. Here she's going off 2 feet, which is fine but not optimal for a layup like this. And then she's got her right hand up, extended, I like that. I'd put her at a 1. She did a little better at the end, finding an angle towards the rim, but really struggled the whole time. She didn't make 1. She was traveling. Good, she was close to the white square, so a little better, but she needs to kind of angle it better and have less power.

He got back on to the beat of the music He made a mistake before but somehow now he's back on the count of one two three touch four five six seven touch eight The dancer doesn't complete four steps when he turns around. He should be turning around one, two, three, touch four, or at this point the music would be five, six, seven, touch eight, but instead he doesn't do four clear steps. He kind of does two and a half or three here. The dancer is back on rhythm here. He is going in and out of rhythm because he's not completing the same amount of steps each time. Every step that he is doing should be four counts. Whether he's going right, whether he's going left, whether he's going right, turning or turning around his right shoulder, whether he's turning around his left shoulder, whether he's going to the side and then turning or doing two turns in a row, each of those steps should always be in a four count sequence. He sometimes does complete this but other times he does not. You The dancer is lifting his right hip here to step out with his right foot. He shouldn't be lifting it up into the air because when he's lifting it up into the air it's kind of creating an arc going from up to down as he steps. And his steps shouldn't be on this arc but instead they should be level, completely just horizontal outward and not his hip going upward and then down. So because the dancer didn't complete that previous step in bringing his feet together, he moved into the turning step too quickly. So now he is one step ahead in the music. Before he should have put his feet together on the fourth count of that measure, whether that was count four or count eight. But instead he began his turn that should have been four more counts, which he did for four counts. But basically the movement and what she did while he was walking towards his right or left side of the screen only took three counts. So then when he turned around taking four counts, he got there a count early because he didn't do the full four counts in the step previously. So now when he's continuing his movement to his right side, which is also our right side of the screen, he is one count ahead. And this will continue to remain the case throughout the choreography unless he gets back on rhythm. The dancer's arm is extended on a diagonal here. He's raising it, I think, because he is mimicking dancing a partner, which is not really necessary since he's dancing by himself. He doesn't need to be practicing this arm movement, which would be trailing a partner. But even so, with him raising his arm right here, he's not doing it at the proper position or angle. As we see in the Eagle view, his arm is extended at an angle on a diagonal, but really his arm should be extended straight forward in front of him because if he is holding a dancer or partner's arm, her or his or their arm would also have to be on this diagonal now. In this sense, his arm is blocking his face. His arm is right in front of his eyes. Instead, his arm should be straight in front of him so that we can see his face and that his partner's arm wouldn't have to also be dragged across their body. He is completely bachata steps in timing, walking 1, 2, 3, touch 4, walking 5, 6, 7, touch 8. Even when he's turning around over his right shoulder, over his left shoulder, whichever direction he's doing it, all these turns are taking four counts. He's turning 1, 2, 3, touch 4, turning 5, 6, 7, touch 8. So in this sense, he is remaining in rhythm and on the timing of the music. Dancer once again also needs to watch his shoulder to not raise so high and that's also more difficult to keep his shoulder down when he's looking downward as well. So he can help himself keep his shoulder down if his eyes are outward instead of downward so that his shoulder is not getting too close to his eyeballs. The dancer is tilting his spine here. He's leaned over to this side and he shouldn't be leaning over like this. His hips should be moving out right and left. That's fine but he shouldn't be having a breakage of his spine on this angle. Instead his his vertebrae should be in a completely vertical alignment and it's just his hips that are moving right and left. The dancer misses a step here in which he his left foot now steps forward But instead his left foot should have been tapping in to his right foot So now he's gonna be off rhythm because he didn't actually complete that step. He moved forward instead Again here the dancer is focused somewhere he shouldn't be. He is looking down and his arm is covering his face, especially because he is looking down. We see his hand in the ego view which shows what he sees. And in that way we can't see his face at all. So he is one covering his face which he shouldn't be doing. And two he is looking downward instead of looking straight outward. The dancer is still one count behind in music and rhythm because he added that extra step previously. The dancer takes now five steps when he turns around instead of taking four. So now as he's going out to the side, he is a count late in the music. He's stepping out on count two instead of count one because he added an extra step in that turn that he just completed. The dancer is rotating his knee again to the side and his knee shouldn't be rotated. It's a result of his hips rotating and then as a consequence his foot is rotating as well. But none of these, whether it's his hip or his knee or his foot, should be facing the side of the room. Here it is, his left side or our right side of the screen. All of these things, his hip, his knee, and his toe, should be facing completely forward. If the dancer does move his arm up as if he's turning a partner, he has to be careful that he keeps his shoulders down. Right here, his left arm is in the air and his left shoulder is up pretty high, getting closer to his ears. And instead, he should be pressing his shoulders down even as he extends his arms up. He could also make more space in his spine by lifting up from his head so that he remains taller, just extending from the top of his head up towards the ceiling. The dancer is circling his arms. They're out to the side and he's circling them as if he is cranking something or rowing a boat. And his arms should really be in front of his body, alternating between one up and one down, mid-level in front of his stomach, just one higher in space than the other. And then that's alternating with each step that he's doing. Inside, they're outward and rowing in circles. Again, his shoulder is up too high, which is more so noticeable because he is looking downward, so he can help himself by looking outward and keeping his shoulder pressed down, even if he is to raise his arm up. We've just seen the ego view of the screen rotate in every which way and direction. Right now the dancer is looking upward, so the view we see the ceiling. And the dancer is focused and head shouldn't be bopping so much right, left, up, down, all these different directions. His eyes should really be steady outward and the ego view should just be panning horizontally right and left across as he moves. It shouldn't be going up and down at all. That should not be happening. And it also shouldn't be rotating or tilted as it is here. That's because his head is tilted on an angle, but instead his head should be directly straight in line with the rest of his spine. The dancer's knee is also rotated to face his left side and his knee shouldn't be rotated inward like this. His knee should just be facing straight to the front of the room. And this knee rotation is happening because he's rotating his hips to his left side. So as his hips turn in, his knee turns in also as a result, and then his toes also end up facing that left side of the room. The dancer just rotated his arm upward and down, which was not necessary and is also not a way in which he should be turning a partner in case that is what he's practicing in turning a partner. If he was turning the partner here, he would have been linking arms with them and then dropping the arm. So either his hand should have been stayed raised in front of him, but not up and down and not arcing or spinning around this way because then the partner would have gone very dizzy and actually would have interrupted or disrupted his or her or their spin. The dancer once again is looking downward and he's tilting his head on an angle. His head should be straight not tilted and his eyes should be outward not downward. The dancer is not moving his hips in opposition to his feet as previously mentioned, but he also is not moving his hips enough. So his hips should be moving right and left horizontally in a very clear way. It should be very obvious, these hip movements. They should be large and he is not really moving his hips that much here. The dancer is awkwardly poking out his chin and his neck forward so his spine is not aligned It's leaning forward and then backwards here instead of being in a straight line Because he's poking his chin out like this which isn't necessary and shouldn't be happening The dancer here just stopped with his right foot, but his hips are also moving to the right, which is incorrect. When he steps with his right foot, his hips should be moving the opposite direction to his left. So his hips should always be moving the opposite direction of his foot that's stepping out, so long as he's doing this basic bachata dance step. The dancers foot steps are a bit heavy. He's stepping flat foot on each step He's doing with the exception of when he brings his toe in on the fourth step of the sequence He's doing this while in that his toes on the floor and his heel is up. So that is good But all the other steps he's doing his feet are flat. So his feet really Don't need to be as high up as they are when he brings this toe in on that fourth count But counts one two and three his heel should be slightly off the floor not all the way up but only slightly so that he can Travel across the room with more ease and shift weight easily as well The dancer is stepping out and touching his foot together, both right and left, in rhythm. So he's stepping one, touch two, step three, touch four. He's stepping on the odd counts and touching on the even counts, and these are in rhythm and in good timing.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Once again, here she's got a lot of clarity happening in her footwork as she's kind of swiping her arms overhead, showing that she can perform two different dynamics, a more staccato movement with her feet, while performing a lighter kind of slicing motion or floating motion in her arms. Overall, she's performing this moment with clarity and is connected to the rhythm more so than she was prior to this. As the dancer moves through some faster movements here, she's really struggling to find clarity in her movement as well as staying connected to the rhythm. Perhaps some additional rehearsal as well as being more grounded in her movement would help her here. But overall could really benefit from finding some clarity as well as grounding to be able to move more quickly and efficiently through the movement. As the dancer begins with a basic salsa step, moving forwards and backwards in the space, she demonstrates that she has an understanding of the movement vocabulary and is able to incorporate an appropriate choreography of the arms in addition to what's happening in the lower body, in particular the footwork. She's able to stay connected to the rhythm primarily through her footwork, though is really using the rest of her body to execute the choreography. Some places for improvement here would be bending the knees more deeply, dropping the pelvis back, being more grounded in her movement overall so that she can incorporate the pelvis, the torso, and the shoulders into her movement and rhythmic embodiment. As the dancer continues through some quicker movements here and starts to turn around herself locomoting through the space again She's really struggling to incorporate her arms in particular in a way that's choreographically appropriate for the movement vocabulary Perhaps this is demonstrating that she only has a very basic understanding of the movement technique and is struggling to improvise on her own Again would benefit from grounding more deeply bending the knees dropping the pelvis and finding some more clarity in her footwork as well as how To incorporate her pelvis her torso and her shoulders As the dancer transitions into a step touch movement that's a bit more stationary from her prior locomoting back and forth She's struggling to stay connected to the rhythm through this transition This is where dropping her pelvis back being more grounded through her movement and bending her knees would help her through this transition to move More quickly and efficiently.

The pianist also has really great coordination between the left hand and the right hand. The rhythm is very even and they're very together. Again, they're descending with their right hand. They have this angle within their elbow that's really quite severe. They could try to bring in their elbow more so it's more aligned with their hand. The pianist plays this section of their scales double time to practice their speed. When ascending, often the pianist is using their hand to initiate the movement. They could use more from their upper arm and also their forearm to help guide their hand, so it's maybe more efficient. The descending line, the pianist plays some wrong notes. It would be good for them just to practice this very slowly, so that they know exactly where their hands are going and what notes to play. The pianist is using curved fingers so they can play with their fingertips. This helps them get a more consistent sound and allows them to play scales this fast. The coordination between the left and the right hand to do this is really excellent. As the pianist is playing arpeggios, they're using their wrist in a pivot motion to help them play all the notes. The pianist has really great knowledge of the keyboard. As they're doing all of these scales and different exercises, they're playing all the notes very evenly and playing the correct notes.

It allows us to put good momentum in our body and generate good power in the shot. We can see from here the dynamic has changed as the retrieval player or the player that could have been acting as goalkeeper has moved to the right hand side of the goal and our subject player is now aiming towards the left. With that being said we can see our stance here. The standing foot is pointing towards the centre of the goal which is what we wanted to see from the previous kicks and we can see quite a good technique with the right foot coming all the way across the body to this position here to guide the ball over towards the left hand side of the goal. So it's good technique, good stance, much better in terms of those things there. However the point of entry in this one is still somewhere around here. Room for improvement would be a little bit more along these lines, somewhere along the inside of the posts, bottom corners or top corners. So a couple of improvements in some areas and pretty much the same in terms of point of entry. So, with this one here, again we look at our point of entry, mid height and close to the outside. Good connection, good power on this one. Decent height, I think. Most likely going in even if the goalie guesses the right way. But slight room for improvement would be if the ball maybe entered closer to the post here or slightly closer to the post here. Obviously, there's more risk but just that little bit higher to save for a goalkeeper should it be closer to the post and further away from the centre of the goal. And then when we talk about the point of entry, so the ball is just about on the goal line right now So our point of entry on the goal is here So we think about goalkeepers again being in the net here Trying to make a save they generally drop down low To either the right or their left if they go to their left in this case. This shot is very saveable It's definitely not up near the higher end of the scale in terms of proficiency So I just want to highlight the best penalty of the video so far. Here we can see the point of entry right here, bottom corner. It's hit with a decent amount of power and I want to go as far to say 99.9% of the time. This penalty is not going to be saved by a goalkeeper because it is moving fast. It is very close to the inside of the post at the bottom corner. So for a goalie to get across from starting point somewhere around here and to be outreached and make a save down that far into the bottom corner is near impossible if they are guessing that is. So yeah, with that power I think that ball is going to beat a goalkeeper to that corner regardless of their speed 99.9% of the time. Very good penalty, very good placement, technique and power. What I like about it again is there is not a lot of predictability in the stance as we lead up to the shot. So the standing foot is central. Even here once the shot is right crossing the line, the centre of the screen is still somewhere along this line here closer to the centre of the goal. So a very good example of a penalty kick here. So we are seeing a consistency in the point of entry when it crosses the goal line. So we're around this area here. I would like to see maybe an improvement per kick. We could be calibrating our kicks and learning from the previous ones to get closer to the inside of the post. This distance has not, from here, got better. It's consistently entering at a point where it's kind of saveable for a goalkeeper should they guess fast to their left-hand side. So just to touch on the approaching angle here, this is a good distance. We would not want to go any lower than here, from here to here. It allows the player to take 4-5 steps towards the ball. So as a right footer here, if we draw a central line through the ball, it's our centre line here. We don't want the angle here to be much less than this 45 degree range. If we come from anywhere along this side here, it's going to suggest that we are going to kick our ball towards the right side of the goal. If we can stay anywhere between this side of the angle here, it can be a little bit more unpredictable because we are not approaching from too tight an angle again, which will show that we have to go to the right because the angle will be too tight to pull it to the left. Obviously we don't want to go from the straight back line here because we have to use our right foot and that's going to suggest that we are actually going to go across our body in this direction here. So yeah, a couple of things there just to think about and look at with this player and with the penalty kicks. Lastly, as the player is now looking at the ball, the centre of their screen is still kind of facing this side of the goal. So maybe a little bit of a tell sign here. I'd rather if they were able to get the centre of the screen lined up with the centre of the goal here. So again, it's a little bit more unpredictable for goalkeepers. In this video of penalty kicks we are going to be looking at a number of different things on our criteria. I will comment on them, take notes and at the end this will bring me to my proficiency score. So some of the things on the criteria we're looking at the technique used and the connection on the ball. We are looking at the power or trajectory of the kick. We are looking at the point of entry when the ball crosses the line to enter the goal. Whereabouts the ball is once it is crossing the line that is. Approaching angle or run up. So what angle is the player approaching the ball from and how does it relate to which foot they are using and how does it help them. We're also then going to look at the body shape in relation to the direction that the player is kicking the ball. So are they facing the center when they're kicking the ball to make it unpredictable or are they facing the exact way they're kicking the ball which makes it very predictable for goalkeepers. So there's great connection, trajectory and power on this shot. Very good penalty but still if this is against a good quality goalkeeper, got to think about the distance of the ball from their hands here. From here to here is not a great distance so although it looks a great penalty here, we would want it to be a little bit further over when entering the goal because again if a goalie guesses this way, it's not a massive distance for them to get across if they really commit to staying up and making that save on their right side. But I still think more times than not this penalty goes in because of the power and the speed on it. But if we're playing against a world class keeper, maybe not. Just to touch on predictability here, if we look at the standing foot, the direction it is facing, it is pointing right in the direction that the player is kicking the ball. Obviously if we draw a line down the centre of our screen too, completely facing this side of the goal. So if we think about a goalkeeper looking for visual cues, we're just giving the goalie two visual cues here, in terms of the direction that we're going to kick our shot. The stance, if we look towards the right-hand side screen, is not bad. The centre of gravity is getting low. We're trying to get a good connection on the ball and planting into it pretty well. But again, it's just the direction that the foot and the hips and the chest are facing that is the issue with this one. I'd much rather see a standing foot facing central to not give away any sort of indication of which side we're going to. And also hips and vision, instead of being here, more lined up with this part here. It's also worth noting that in this exercise, if we look at the right hand side camera, the penalty spot is actually located right here. This here is our 6 yard box, the penalty spot is 12 yards. The player is probably kicking at 7 yards maximum. So this is a shorter distance, meaning that the kicks should be more accurate in terms of our aim. We obviously want to be aiming as far away from the central point as possible in our aim. We want to be aiming somewhere along these kind of areas here, highlighted. Top corners, inside of the posts. And the same on the other side of the goal. Anywhere inside the posts or in those bottom corners is pretty much going to be guaranteed a goal should we have enough power to beat the goalkeeper to these spots. Generally, the goalie obviously starts off central here. They're always going to pick a side to dive either in this direction or to dive in this direction with outstretched hands if they're professional goalkeepers, meaning that these are generally the areas to avoid. So if we look at the setup in this one, the player here on the left hand side screen, you can see it standing on the left hand side of the goal. Here, again, left hand side of the goal, to add a bit of realistic, I suppose, accuracy and realistic aim in this one, we could have had this player standing central. Even if they're not saving the ball, it just gives us a little bit more of a realistic setup in this one, where a player taking a penalty kick would usually have a goalie standing in the centre, and they would have to try to be evasive with their movements, the way they're facing. As we can see in this video, if we look at our left hand side screen, our body is facing centrally, facing almost the inside of the post here, which again, in a normal penalty kick, would be a telltale sign to a goalkeeper that our player is kicking to that side of the goal, and which maybe affect their choice in their save selection. So the setup here may be causing the body shape to be forced a little bit to one side, which we may not see should it be an actual penalty kick with a central goalkeeper trying to save the shot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

When further practicing the finger style exercise, it would help to watch the right hand, use the thumb as kind of an anchor to always start on and play the lowest pitch, and then just focus on which fingers should be playing the remaining notes in the chord. Here the guitarist is playing some 9th chord arpeggios. They are keeping the fingers curved and getting a clear sound. Here they are demonstrating how they prepare the left hand to play arpeggios. You can see they are extending the left fingers out and they are more flat. Here the guitarist is demonstrating an ascending major scale. You can hear them slow down when approaching the last few pitches at the top of the scale. Here they are demonstrating a part in the piece where their pointer finger will go back and forth between the first and third frets while their pinky stays planted on the fifth fret. Here they are showing a different left hand position where the fingers are more curved over the strings. Here, there was one mistake made in the pitch when performing the scale again. They slow down a bit when playing the final three pitches in the scale. You can also see that they're using their thumb and pointer to pick the strings rather than a plastic pick. The guitarist is demonstrating a phrase in their piece where they start in first position or home position and then have to transition up to a chord that starts on the fifth fret. Here the guitarist is demonstrating some finger style chord progressions where you would play the bass note or the lowest note with the thumb and then the remaining strings and pitches repeatedly they are playing in an inconsistent tempo and separating the chords it would help to just practice these at a Consistent slow speed and then work them up to a speed that they could be performed one after the other When keeping the fingers flat here and transitioning up the fretboard you can hear there's some incorrect notes being played. They are now performing the ascending and descending parts of the major scale together while doing an alternating picking pattern with the right hand fingers. Here they are playing a seventh chord followed by a major seventh chord. You can hear in the major seventh chord one of the pitches is raised. Here you can see the pointer finger is extended to reach a lower pitch on the fretboard.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They are doing a good job at playing their repeated notes, which are more staccato and separated in the left-hand part, and some of the pitches in their right-hand melody. They are sustaining or holding longer, and they're getting more of a legato or smooth and connected articulation on these particular notes in the phrase. Here the pianist did an excellent job at transitioning into their next section of the piece. They returned to their original speed and are successfully performing their repeating pitch with their left hand thumb at an even tempo. Here the bassline part played in the left hand could have been played a bit more smoothly and steadily. It would help to review this phrase a few times left hand alone to get more comfortable with this pattern of pitches and to be able to play it at a more even speed and smoothly. The pianist performed the previous phrase left hand alone. They did a good job here at adding their right hand back to perform this next phrase hands together. When they performed the beginning of this next phrase, their left and right hand parts were aligned perfectly well together, and the rhythms were synchronized. Here you can see the left hand thumb playing the same key or pitch repeatedly at a fast even speed. You can now see the left hand is shifted to a different spot on the keyboard and the pianist is demonstrating good hand position. All five fingers are curved around it over the keys of the piano. Here the pianist is adding a bit of embellishment or extra pitches to their right hand melody, which is making the melody sound a bit more interesting here. The minor mistake in pitch or the extra incorrect pitch that was played did not slow the pianist down or throw them off at all. They are continuing on with the rest of their phrase and are maintaining a steady tempo. Here the tempo sounds more even again as the left hand plays a pattern in the bass line with multiple pitches. Here there is a bit of fluctuation in the tempo. The tempo is speeding up and it does not sound intentional. Here the aim of the right hand third finger was a bit off. It slid and played these two white keys at the same time when it should have been a bit more curved around it and firmly planted on the one key and pitch that they intended to play here in this phrase. Here the pianist is demonstrating nice finger crossing technique in their right hand part. They are varying the melody a lot here and are playing a more rhythmically challenging phrase. The pianist is performing a bass line in their left hand part and the more melodic line in their right hand part. Certain pitches in their left hand part they are playing and repeating several times in a row. So right now you can see them playing this particular key and pitch with their pointer finger of the left hand repeatedly at a fast speed. Again here, the pianist is adding some embellishment or extra pitches to their right hand part to vary it a bit and make it sound more interesting and musical. Here the pianist is gradually slowing down their tempo to make this phrase sound more finished and complete before moving into the next section of their piece. Now you can see the right hand fingers are extended to cover and play a wider range of notes needed in the melody. The pianist is doing a great job at performing their repeating bassline notes in their left-hand part while the right hand plays the melody. Both the left and right hand parts are aligning well together rhythmically. In the right hand part, the pianist is playing some single line melody and is now incorporating some chords into the right hand part as well. Here you can see the left hand fingers are extended to cover a wider range of notes, and currently the left hand thumb and left hand pinky are taking turns to play a pattern with the lowest and highest pitches in this range.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And so that's going to kind of probably involve taking his knee and moving it over here and really pulling through with his hamstring and like really pulling his weight to the side. And really tensioning that heel hook. Right now it looks like he just kind of sets it on it. And when he does fall off, it looks like it just slides off.

This is a real moment of shine or kind of a high point for the dancer. She's got fairly nicely shaped arms, though they could use a little bit of clarity, but she's effectively incorporating polyrhythm into her body, moving her upper body or her shoulders at a different tempo than her feet or a different rhythm than her feet. She's also got a lot of nice clarity in her feet. She's got her knees bent, her pelvis dropped back, though she could always be a little bit more grounded, but overall this is a high point for the dancer. As the dancer begins to perform this series of quicker movements, they continue to maintain this kind of up and down bouncing quality in their movement, which is really disconnecting them from the rhythm and also keeping them from being grounded in their body. If they were to drop their pelvis back and bend their knees more, focusing on this kind of weighted grounding in their movement rather than this kind of up and down bounce, they would be able to find a deeper connection to the rhythm. They would also benefit from some clarity in general in the use of the arms and the upper body. As the dancer begins with a basic salsa step, moving forwards and backwards in the space, they demonstrate a fairly elementary understanding of the movement vocabulary. They are able to incorporate their arms choreographically in a way that makes sense, though is lacking attention to rhythmic embodiment. And same thing with their feet as well. They would benefit from bending their knees more, dropping their pelvis back, being more grounded in their movement, and incorporating their head a little bit deeper into their movement. Right now their focus is kind of shifted or fixed upwards. If they were to incorporate the movement of their head, their chest, and their upper body overall, they would be able to more deeply embody the rhythm. As the dancer performs this turn around herself, this kind of chaine turn locomoting through the space, she falls off balance a little bit and she is spotting her head slightly, though she would benefit from some clarity in using the spot of the head. She would also really benefit from some clarity in the shaping of the arms, which are, she's struggling to find clarity there. Again, she needs to drop her pelvis back, bend her knees, and overall be more grounded in her movement to move more quickly and efficiently through this turn. In this moment of transition from this basic salsa step into some quicker steps that the dancer is going to be moving through in just a moment, they struggle through this transition. Here they kind of stand in a very pedestrian manner, they don't incorporate their arms in a way that's choreographically appropriate for the movement vocabulary, and they have this kind of up and down bouncing quality to their movement as if they're preparing to head into the next movement series. Overall, they would really benefit from some additional rehearsal and finding clarity in how to transition from one step into the next without having this very kind of obvious transitional moment.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He's got great footwork, great lift, tough shot here, shooting it back over your head, but the ball comes off just right, maybe a little behind his hands here. Nice job. Here's the footwork. Nice. He's got two hands on the ball. Maybe keep it up a little higher. Get it up there a little quicker. Eyes are up. Nice job. Again, uses that one dribble to set up his footwork and spacing here. He's got two hands on the ball. Here comes that right leg in behind, working really hard to get this angle. But again, you know, he's choosing to raise it and shoot it up over his shoulder. Again, times it greatly with that left foot push-off, raising of the right knee, takes it up with two hands, maybe sticking it out a little bit as he raises it up. Again, eyes are up. Nice job there. Here's the lift, push off, hips rise, again, raises the ball up, lets the guide hand come off. Again, this is another way to shoot a reverse layup, is to shoot it back over the head. Again, it's not as probably what I call fundamental and basic because you're not squaring your shoulders on the shot. I mean, this is another skill level here, but nice job. Again, he again goes off the correct foot. He lifts. He's choosing just to kind of shoot it back over his shoulder. You know, I prefer facing and being more fundamental, but this works for some people if they can really extend their body up and stay with it and keep their eye on their target looking back over their head. But here the ball leaves the hand here. It looks good. He keeps his other arm up here for balance and control. Nice job there. Here's the shot that comes back over the head. You know, again, it's another way to shoot a reverse layup. Takes one big dribble here to set up his footwork. There's the dribble. Eyes are up. That's what I want to show you here. He's not looking at the ball when he dribbles. He's looking at his basket, his target, where he wants to be in relation to the basket to finish. Here's the shot. Again, not real, you know, not squaring up to the basket, facing the basket like I would like to see. He shoots it across his shoulder, but that works for him. Here, see how he shoots back over his head? I mean, you've got to spin that ball right off that backboard. It's got to hit just right. But he does, he's got good lift. He's got good body control, uses his left arm to help maintain his body balance. Here's the lift, shoots it back over that right shoulder. Again, not my preference, but again, this works for him. He stays with the shot, hips are up, feet are pushing off. Nice job. Here the shooter is shooting, going from left to right, shooting a right hand reverse layup. He's pushing up hard off that left foot. You know, he's choosing to really drive under the basket and kind of shoot back over his head. A lot of people shoot reverse layups like this. It works. It's not as fundamental because you're not really squaring up your shoulders, but it's effective. And he's going hard. He's lifting. You can see he's looking back, but he's got a great... I love how the ball comes off these fingertips. Again, not as fundamental because you're not squaring up your body to the basket. Here's the shot, good lift, footwork, love his body control here, shoots it back over his shoulder, but he's got his eyes on the target, which is crucial here. I love how the ball comes off the fingertips. Again, not squaring up, but this is how, it's another way to shoot a reverse layup, especially if you're coming in here dribbling kind of what I call flat here in line with the basket. It's not like you're coming in at this angle, it's more driving the baseline. This is the baseline. Here's the finish. Again, I love how he lands. He's bent. See how he keeps looking? He keeps looking back at the basketball. Again, does go off the correct foot, raises that right knee hard, really love everything about this. See that guide hand come off. Again, it's not an easy thing to do to shoot it back over your head. He's not squaring, which is probably why I gave him a nine. I prefer to face up and square and be really fundamental here. Again, two hands as he picks up the dribble. I like that. Footwork is really nice. I love how he finds where he is. He's looking up, not looking at that dribble. Again, here's the plant. He's got the ball in two hands. I would prefer to be more up and tight to the chest. You know, a defender could strip this away, but he's got two hands on it, so he's being a lot stronger with it. His eyes go up. So see how he shoots back over his head and he's not square. So some people shoot this when they're really driving hard, what we call driving the baseline. They shoot it back over their head. Again, you've got to stay with it. You've got to, that ball's got to come off, you know, really high on that square to have a chance.

You know, getting getting up to the pose, bouncing out, really driving through his feet and moving up the wall with power and accuracy. So again he opts for the heel hook this time, but this time he really leans into it. So you can see in the starting position he places the heel on. You can see just how kind of low the knee is. And so he hasn't really engaged it yet. But in the next frame you'll see how far his knee moves over. So he really does a good job of rocking over this knee and really pulling through his heel hook. Instead of just placing it. So he really tensions it this time. So here you can see how he gets his pinch and really drives his hips into the wall as he raises his knee kind of up and to the left, really rocking over and being able to pull through this foothold.

We aren't able to see his neck here. This also is exacerbated by him looking downward and tilting his head down, but he can be taller in his verticality and stand longer, especially because he is a tall man, but he would be able to do that better if he pressed down his shoulders so that he could be higher in his height. The dancer is not on rhythm as he is clapping his arms and moving backwards. He should be on the downbeat, either every even count or every odd count, but each of his claps on movements backwards should be equally spaced from each other with the music. Instead, he is not at all dancing on the beat of the music. He's dancing pretty independently, so his musicality is not very present here. The dancer looks downward here when he should be looking outward, especially so that his head is straight on his spine. Right now his neck is tilted at an angle. The dancer's arms are a bit awkward. He's sometimes holding them as if he's dancing with a partner. He doesn't always do this consistently. Because there's no partner there, he doesn't need to be doing this with his arms. It's just making him look more stiff and more awkward. He'd be better off embodying his arms as part of his movement, adding it into his dancing, solely focused on his body, not an invisible and pretend additional body. The dancers movements aren't very clear when he's turning from facing one side of the room to the other side of the room. He doesn't always turn his full body around each way. And this is really should be spirit spearheaded from his eyes, wherever his eyes look is where his body will follow. So if his eyes doesn't don't if his eyes don't turn on, he doesn't fully turn his head to whatever direction he's trying to change the movement into, the rest of his body is not going to actually reach there. So he really needs to work on his focus and his directionality here. The dancers arms are basically moving independently from his spine whenever he's clapping his arms in front of him It just seems like his arms are In and of themselves. It's that his arms are actually extensions of his back or should be extensions of his back and his spine So he needs to coordinate his arms also with his spine and movement so that they aren't just Thrown out right in front of him and not a part of the rest of his body The dancer is not extending his legs fully. His legs should go into a straight line. They remain a bit bent. He needs to extend his legs further out away from his body. The dancers hands are a bit awkward here We see that his thumb is pointing outward as if he is holding his hand in a thumbs up. That's just tension gathering in his arms He should relax his arms and he should be using his arms dancing not just held in with this thumbs up position The dancer is flat-footed with his feet flat on the ground. Really, he should be on his toes and his heels should be off the ground so he could be maneuvering more easily and be lighter on his feet. The dancer made a mistake in the sequence here. He's been doing kick, kick, double kick, or right, left, right, right, and then repeating that left, right, left, left. And in this very last series, he should have ended it with a double kick on the same leg, but instead he did a single kick on each leg.

He can seem longer and taller if he presses his shoulders instead downwards, so it would elongate his neck and give him some space between his chest and the end of his head. And in general his transitions of his footwork could be more fluid. He is executing the choreography so technically he is doing the right steps when he's opening and then stepping inward and then crossing that series of three steps that he does both to his right and his left. He's doing those steps correctly but it's very he's very particularly going open center cross open center cross and in general all of his steps could be much more fluid and bleed a bit more into each other and not be so robotic. The dancer is a bit heavy on his feet. He's stepping with quite a bit of force. He doesn't need to pick his feet up as high. He's really bending his knees and picking his knee up and in turn picking his foot up when he lifts it before he crosses over. And even when he lifts his feet when he's going to the side. It would be in his best interest to be lighter on his feet. The dancer is striking a final pose and position, but I do wish again he was not looking down, especially here with his arm placement. His arm is blocking his face, so we're not able to see his face because his arm is raised and his head is down. So it'd be better if his head was straight so that he can take pride in the dance, in completing this dance series that he just performed. I'd like to commend the dancer for having great energy. He is heavy on his feet, yes, but every step he's doing is with explosive energy. So every time he's tapping his foot forward and bouncing up and down in his spine, he's doing it with such great energy. And that's definitely a part of his dancing that he should keep. It's definitely an asset of his. Again, the dancer continues to look down and it's shrinking his spine. If he looked outward, he would remain taller and aligned in his verticality. The dancer's spine is a bit condensed, perhaps because he's leaning forward a little bit, but he can be less condensed and be taller in his verticality if he lifts up from his spine, from his coccyx bone, which is the end of his vertebrae, all the way upward so that he's just extended and standing up tall. That would help him. The dancer's movement can be less robotic, particularly if he uses his hips to help cushion and guide the movement. So it's not so much about his feet stepping in each direction, but his whole body engaging in each movement to each direction. He can be lighter on his feet by pushing his weight onto his toes and lifting his heels so that he's not stomping on the ground, but instead placing his feet particularly onto his toes. The dancer also is looking down sometimes thus far. We see that he sees the floor panel. That's also making him look a bit shrunken or condensed in his spine. So he can elongate his spine, also particularly his cervical spine, which is his neck, by looking straight ahead.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

After maintaining this position, pulling down here and then wrenching this way with this heel hook and kind of sitting in this little box, the climber was able to lerp their left hand out into this ball and are able to move forward.

Especially if it's nice and lubricated, you can get a nice little flip and the egg will go onto the other side and it will not break or nothing. I'm hoping that he moves the pot in a circular motion to make sure that the whole pan is lubricated nicely with the oil. See, if he would gather all those ingredients prior to starting everything and get everything in the workstation, he wouldn't have to be searching in the cooler looking for other ingredients. He should have all of that stuff out on the counter and ready to cook. And a nice base. He flipped that relatively easy. It's nice to see that he had enough patience to let that base come together. He needs to continue to be patient. If anything, just move the pot in a circular motion. But don't go moving it around with the spatula. Let that base form. You can also move the pen in a circular motion just to fill in this little gap over here to form a better base. I like the fact that he's being patient and allowing the base to form. Before he starts to crack this egg, I would like to see him get his pot on the stove and start bringing it up to temp. By the time he's finished doing that with the egg and whatever veggies he's putting in the omelet, the fry will be ready and he can go back to the frying pan with the egg mixture. Nice, this is what I was looking for. That way, it's going to prevent the element from sticking and the paint is going to be totally lubricated. He still doesn't have a pot out there getting hot yet. He's going in, doing all this stuff, mixing everything in, and he doesn't have his frying pan under the heat yet. Yeah, it's fairly decent finger placement with the knife.

Her arms aren't at the same level. Her left arm is a bit higher than her right arm. Her arms should be at the same exact level in the air. The dancer can keep her arms lengthened completely for a little bit longer. She starts bending them in on the earlier side, so she could just leave them extended for a bit longer in time. That would be even better and make the movement even more easier to see and witness. The dancer's arm position in the air, her left arm is not completely clear. If it's supposed to be completely straight or more so bent, it's in a little bit of an in-between space. So if she could clarify her arm movement, that would be better.

That's her left hand in her hip her right hand Connected to the back of her head her legs are straight her arms are both bent mirroring Opposite of each other that is very good.

Her leg is completely straight. She's lifting all the way upward. The dancer has a great range of motion. She brings her right knee up very high. It's basically chest level and even her heel is up very high. It's higher than her thigh. So she has a great execution. You're bringing up her right leg for a range of motion. The dancer does a really good job of articulating and isolating these chest movements forward and in Out and inward especially because the music is so fast even though with it being so fast She doesn't sacrifice her range of motion here and her articulation. So that's great However, the dancer's pathway of her arms are very good. She brings her arms in a circle around towards the back of her, like a swim stroke, down and around and upward. So that pathway is very good. The dancer has really good eye focus and an eye spot. She shakes her head or turns her head with great strength to the back and to the back to the front or returning to the front. She does that very quickly in rhythm and she does that very well, which means she's not tense in her neck. She's able to move it quickly because she's not squeezing her neck or holding it too harshly with tension. The dancer does a good job of making contact between her foot and her hand here.

So here he's doing a little kick step and just kind of rocking. I do like that he's jumping up in this movement and I think if he would have done that earlier it just would have made the movement feel a little more connected to the style of dance. So really good job keeping that nice bounce in this part. So I'm not quite sure what the choreography was supposed to be. It felt a little bit all over the place. So I think just if he were on the music I think that would have just made it feel a bit cleaner and better for the steps that he just took. So being on the music definitely helps a lot, especially when the movements aren't really like clear in design. So here he's adding a little a small jump to the cross over and I think if he would have just you know make that a little bit bigger really nice knee bend in the cross but don't be afraid to kind of add a little more hop to the beat into the step. So here he's almost doing kind of a quick step in a sense because his feet are moving pretty quickly to the music and I think it would just help him a lot if he went up on his toes because then and also bending your knees because that just kind of gives you the freedom to move a little bit faster. And in the twist, he's also doing a good job twisting his upper body and really moving those arms side to side opposite of the way his knees and feet are going. So here he's doing a little twist to move forward. He's doing a good job getting his knees nice and bent. He's finally up on his toes, so that's nice to help with the twist and just making it easier to twist your legs side to side, just because you have more of the leverage on your toes and less if your heels are down. So the dancers starting with just he's stepping his foot out right now he's stepping out his right foot and then it comes together by his left and then does like a double tap. I think he needs to be a little more clear and if his heel is touching the floor if if it's his toe and then being a little more lighter on his standing leg because right now it just feels really weighted and heavy in a song that should be a little more light. The final spin was actually nice, just a nice simple spin. He had his leg up and he spun around on his toe. I'll say overall this dancer really has to work on the timing and music because I definitely think it affects how he moves. So keeping the rhythm, especially for this style of dance, the music is there so definitely use it and let it kind of guide your full body. So here he's taking a kick with his right leg and doing a little step back and he's also clapping his hands in between. I know space-wise it may be a little difficult but I just think the the rhythm like he's clapping the correct rhythm is just not on the right timing of the music so that kind of throws it off a little bit but the traveling I think is good for this beginner choreography. So here he's doing a, he's stepping and then crossing back with his foot. I think maybe taking his foot and crossing up top on his toe instead of just putting his, the ball of his foot down. Maybe just make it a step and toe step instead of step ball again to add a little more lightness and bending those knees a little bit more. So here he's doing a little step crossing over and then rocking back and forth. Again I think he just needs to be a little bit lighter. Right now all of his steps are really flat to the floor so really using his full foot maybe getting up on his toes maybe bending the knees a little bit more and also using a bit of his upper body to lean forward and back.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The climber quickly makes his choice as he is right now hanging on to an edge with the left hand which is not a very comfortable one and it seems like it's a shallow edge that the climber is barely pinching. In this instance the climber decides to shift over his weight totally on the left toe which is placed on a foot chip down below and to place more force to this the climber is staying low and does this by dropping the heel to create more force onto that foothold. Here we can see the climber is doing something differently this time where he decides to switch his right foot with his left foot that was before in placement. So that is a new change that the climber is doing when attempting going up for the last hold. Here we can see the climber chose to retract his hand and go back into the matching hold that he was holding on to before in the same way. The reason why was because when the climber had his left hand up on the highest hold, he had his right leg flagging out and wanted to transfer over the weight to the highest foot, this one wanting to place the heel in first to join onto a match with the right hand. So that heel was a little bit too high up and the climber was losing balance when making the placement. So the climber decided to drop the foot and instead had a slightly lost grip of the top hold and the green one and so the climber decided to just quickly let go of the heel driving his weight down and made the climber let go of the left hand and secure the grip to not let go of the wall back in match on that orange hold. So when the climber got to reach the top hold, he was completely extended, meaning the feet were down here below, and felt stuck. So the climber decided to let go of the feet, so he's cutting feet at this moment. And this he does by eventually taking momentum of the swing to bring his feet at a higher placement. Something the climber does well is taking advantage of the momentum where the climber does a slight pull up to make the match to the same jug where the left hand was and quickly presses down on that heel taking advantage that that heel placement has a still energy on especially on the pulling of the leg movement since the leg hasn't been quite engaged until he totally presses on it to transfer the weight over and is using the heel as it almost like a third hand so the heel is pushing down as he brings the knee over to the right side and at the same time the left hand is pushing down which helps the climber to smoothly make the transfer up to the next hold also we can see how the climber has send the left leg out and this is used for balance which is called flagging out and that's to let the hand the grip and heel hook take most of the engagement on pressure for the climber to then gain the reach Here at the climber we can see him leaning back as far as he can and this is so that he can extend his arms solely holding on to the grips above which both are jugs. Now the climber brings his right foot which was placed the lowest to a high stance and bringing the heel in first instead of the toe. This is because the climber is positioning the heel behind the edge that the climber is holding on to. Since he has enough space and also the climber is doing this to secure the foot and thinking about when releasing the hand how he's going to place that as his main support system. Again the climber has brought then from the swing and cut feet to be in a higher stance where he spreads his feet out for the stance. The left foot is staying on the foot chip down below and the right foot seems as it's going with the heel in first behind the edge of being a side pull kind of hold. This the climber will have to engage the heel forcefully while also hanging tight onto the right hand that's a big jug with a lip so that is a comfortable hold on hold to hold on to as a climber tries to adjust and reposition his left hand on that edge above. Here we can see the climber have swapped his feet by bringing the right foot out and the left foot into a higher position also closer to being underneath the grips that he was holding down before. Now that the climber got to reach the top hold he actually does this by not only standing up on the feet but it's important the climber makes a twist to have his torso be facing to the right in this case is supported by the foot not only being pushing down but the climbers also pushing against the wall this to support the hip twist as well as the left leg having the knee point out towards the right side and as we can see the climber is pulling himself in but also twist is his shoulder to help the climber gain height and gaining height is also helpful if the climber keeps the left side towards the wall Here the climber potentially was running out of grip strength, reason why he let go of the left hand. In this case the climber had a better stance before dropping the right foot, thinking that the right foot was going to help him keep low, it was actually making the left foot push him away from the wall. This because it was too much in a high stance and when the climber was trying to extend the leg it was actually pulling him out. The climber before had a better stance and probably having to work on opening up that hip of the left side might have helped the climber better to gain a stability when moving over to his left foot when transferring the weight over if it's making a stance of his hips over the foot. Here we can see the climber has opened up the stance in order to focus on the weight distribution down at the feet. It was important that the climber was positioned right so he can make the throw for the dynamic extension and aim direction. So on this one the climber has brought the left foot to be spread out onto a hold out left. This one pushing from the toe. The toe actually is making the climber pushing it down and out left while the right foot is the one that is pressing so that the climber can go directly up. Since the climber it needed to go slightly to the right side is the reason why it's important to the climber keep appropriate stance when making such a committed throw since he was coming from the match down below. Also keeping the hips close to the wall the climber brings the elbow as close as he can to his body while engaging on the pull up for the spring up to that hold. Here the climber has placed the right foot and has sent his leg to point the knee inwards, meaning pointing out left, and this to help the climber keep his right side close to the wall. As he does the pull up, he quickly lets go of the right hand to bring the right hand up to a match. This is a very small edge so it's important that the climber creates a lot of pressure onto those grips above. So leaning on the hold, meaning trying to press those fingertips on the top of that edge, is really important and the climber needs to do as static as he can, reason why he drops down to create more pressure. Also to avoid the climber from falling the wrong direction, he taps the left toe against the wall to keep himself going down in that direction and not to swing inwards into the wall as that would make him lose pressure. So he keeps the leg extended to push himself out. The climbers are starting at a sit start. Sit starts are usually difficult and add to the grade of the climb. This is because the climber will have to start from no pressure on the hands and the feet and would have to carry the climber's weight up to the grips by raising the hips. And then the climber will have to distribute the weight into the limbs, onto the wall. Once the climber gets himself off the mat, then the climb will start. Here the climber is solely relying on the grip above and decides to extend the arm. This is called the rest position because the arm is not engaged and only the grip is the one creating the pressure at this moment. We can see down below the climber decides to keep the left foot to help with the stability. At this point the climber has two points of contact. This means his base of support being the left side. He sends the right leg underneath, flagging in, so that the climber is able to stabilize him from swinging to the right. He presses the foot down against the wall to keep stable. The climber needs to drop his right arm down to shake his hand and his entire arm so that he can release any pressure build up that has been created on the arm. The climber before had it pretty tight up there on the orange hold before, especially when he was bringing his right heel up for a match. This time it was great of the climber to down climb so that he can endure the next moves if coming back to the wall. Here in this moment where the climber gets to pull himself and brought the left hand up to the next hold, this being a positive edge at the top, the climber is able to comfortably grip the top with the fingers being indented in behind the lip of the hold. He was actually forcing the pull and throw out left by pressing down on the right toe against the wall and not in any foot chips. It looks like the climber was also keeping the leg extended, slightly bended, but pressing really that toe against the wall which helps the climber drive force to keep the hips square and stay in position so that he doesn't get driven off the wall and help keep all of the weight of the climber onto that left toe. Here the climber has brought the left toe to join next to the heel hook which gives him a solid stance as he's squatting and keeping the weight down. This keeps his center of gravity close to the base of support down at the feet and he has quickly sent the left hand to join also on a match. Now since the climber has the arms extended this gives the climber a position of rest and the only engagement that is coming right now is from the grip as he's staying low. Whenever the climber is ready to make the next movement he'll probably make a pull up and change the stance in order to come out of this position. Here the climber has quickly make a foot placement to a very nice edge so the entire toe box is able to surface against that hold down at the foot and the climber is having a hard time to bring himself over to the wall. This is a number of reasons. First of all the holds are not the greatest and he needs to bring at least his elbows down and close to the wall but due to wanting to create extra grip for those holds above the climber has the elbows out and instead is really trying to step up on that left toe. It's really difficult of the climber to maintain this so in order to do that the climber must open up his hips so I would say to bring the hips close to the wall or potentially to help that would be placing the right foot back onto the wall while he needs to lower his stance in order to maintain the grips above. The left foot has left a hold and instead has been pointed out. This is called flagging out, which is only using it for balance. This, keeping the foot off the wall, helps the climber to transfer the weight over to the holds where he has his points of contact on, which is the heel hook at this moment and the right hand that has come into a match joining the left hand. So a match is when both hands are in the same hold or both limbs are in the same hold and brings the right hand over the left hand. Now it's important to know that the climber must keep the pressure on that heel hook and heel hooks are usually known to be really strong and they are a technical type of footwork. So in order to engage the heel hook, the climber is using it almost like a third hand where he presses it down and also slightly presses it, the heel, towards the edge to help with the pulling motion as the climber gains leverage. Here the climber has to step up on the left toe, this one being placed the highest of the feet and this can help the climber to distribute the weight for doing the quick pull up to move his left hand up to the next move.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So this undercling, if he pulls at all, he's not gonna be able to kind of get upper movement of it. He really has to shift his feet around and get higher feet. So he can kind of spring from his feet and kind of dead point up to this area. But he just isn't able to push through the feet. So maybe by twisting one of the knees in to get a little bit better balance or better positioning would be the key to this. But he just isn't able to transfer the weight. And I think he's trying to transfer his weight too fast to this left arm out of his right arm since it's like the higher hold. He's really gotta do a good job of first really gripping the right hand, getting into position. And then as he can stand up through it, transferring the weight to his left hand. We like to use this heel because this hole is really big and flat. It's a little bit higher. It's going to let him pull straight through the heel to pull himself up. It's going to toe down and shift his weight over that foot. It's going to let him transfer all that pulling power of his leg straight into the foothold. So he's not off to a bad start, but he kind of gets these things he, um, like he doesn't fully relax into this first move. He could get a little bit more over, um, which kind of let him lean back and help him set his heel up on this hold. So it's like he could just take it maybe 20% further into the positions and really own the positions. You can see just how much of pulling over it lets him just kind of like casually reach up to this higher hold and kind of maintain that position so that heel hook is a really good move. Whereas if he had to toe down, he'd have to kind of push to the hold and kind of perch on top of it. With the heel, he's able just to pull with his entire leg all the way through it. He's also doing a lot of pulling himself in. So right now you can see how bent his arms are as he's sitting on the same feet. So he's having to do a lot of readjusting. So it looks like he's maybe not comfortable with his angle or not fully comfortable in the positions. He's kind of trying to fight that.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So that's really going to let him pull down with his feet. Now let's take the place of a hand and notice with this heel hook he's utilizing a back leg which you can't really see it but that left leg is behind his right heel. So as he gets ready to move his left hand it kind of bounces out, helps him keep tension. Now he's getting ready to move his right hand so he gets opposite pose so he's got left hand on right foot on. But he could have just left his left foot on here and back-legged, bounced out, made this next move and saved himself a foot swap. and he tries to bump up to the next hole but it just does not work out and he falls off the wall. So he's starting off with kind of arms crossed. He's kind of moving up to the left. So he's kind of starting off with this like right hand, almost got a stone, but he's able to pull both hands. Once again, he's not really kind of utilized in the best position. So in this case, his knee is still face, kind of horizontal with the hold. So when he's pushing with his toe, he's almost had to pull down instead of being able to push his weight through his toe. So kind of bring this knee up and over, probably a good start to get his lower body in the right position. Or else instead, as he kind of moves to the left, his body, this foot's gonna kind of be pushing him right. So it's gonna be kind of at odds with what he's trying to do. So he's on this next hold, it's kind of like this kind of pinch undercling. So the positive edge is kind of towards the down and to the left. And so right now he's down to the right. So what he needs to do is keep all of his weight on this right arm, but now reposition his body so he can kind of pivot around and be on the upper right side of this hold. So he can pull through it, not have to fight it. Then as he makes the other move he swaps his feet back one more time instead of just backflagging. So we can see it, you know, as he gets his left hand hold, his lower body and his hips don't really move much, so he really is moving around with his upper body and torso more than kind of positioning himself with his lower body.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Does a hand-foot match that's gonna free up his Left hand to move and it's gonna get his left foot as high as possible I can see he's doing a good job also to staring down at his feet, looking for open spots. So once he kind of gets in this position, he relaxes his arms, keeps them nice and straight, and you can immediately see his gaze is going downward just to see where he wants to put his feet. So he's really diligent about finding the best foot and getting the best position.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

If the climber was to attempt this again, he needs to make sure he keeps the right foot being picked up so that the body can follow the direction of the throw. That way the climber also makes a more secure placement of the right hand coming onto the hold by applying the palm further in in order to gain a better grip and have more friction when surfacing the hold. It is key the climber continues to glance over at the hold that he will be making the hand placement to. And as we can see the climber had pushed forcefully onto his left foot placement, now coming out of contact with the hold. This was so that he was able to go out on the direction of the hold at reach and brings the right knee to come inwards. This is so he is able to bring his right side of the body close to the wall. Now that the climber's chest is at the same height as his grips, it is important he keeps the chest close to the wall. This is so when the climber starts gaining height on the flight, he remains underneath the hold at reach. The climbers starting at a two hand hold start where he places his hands at the bottom area of the hold. Due to the shape of the holds, these ones are called donuts and the climber is placing the fingers far in into the hole of the hold. And is able to create more pressure at the grip by engaging the thumbs over on the outside to squeeze the grip. Once the climber gets to secure the hand placements, he had sent the feet to come up into position and since he is no longer standing on the mat, then the climb has started. The climber was able to land the right hand over to the edge of the hold and as we can see he was able to jump on his right foot to boost the move coming out of contact immediately so the climber must secure the right hand placement before dropping the weight onto the grip. It is important that once the climber gets to secure the hands and feet placements, he then glances over at the hold at reach. This is called aiming and we'll need to focus on exactly what area of the edge of the hold he would like to send his hand to come into place. Now the climber is building momentum by swinging side to side. For when the climber is ready to jump, he will then jump over, swinging to the right side and pushed on the feet in order, mostly pushing on his left foot to gain direction to the hold at reach. And that is important that he bring his center of gravity as close to the wall to remain underneath the hold at reach.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She stumbled over the last few notes and kind of slowed down a little bit. I think partially that was due to the fact that her second finger is still continuing to raise unnecessarily. Right here she had to shift up to a different position and she didn't quite find it right away so you could hear her kind of slide around to find the home base pitch. But she eventually got to it. It did kind of disrupt the flow of the music however. When playing this etude, it is really important that the violinist focuses on placing the third finger here down with the second finger. And occasionally her second finger, like in this frame right here, is actually raised up above while the third finger is pressed. So ideally you would want the violinist to put both the second and the third finger down at the same time. And since her second finger is unnecessarily raising, it's creating extra work and it's a little bit of an inefficient left hand technique. Right here her pinky shifted up to the natural harmonic on the E string, which is like the halfway point between the bridge and the nut on the violin. This note here does not have to be pushed down all the way by the finger. It's just a very gentle touch that you can do. So this touch harmonic note can be difficult to locate sometimes, but she shifted up to it accurately and her pinky was in the right spot. She had the right amount of pressure with her pinky, so the note rang beautifully clear. As she's playing with her second finger here, her first finger is a little bit off of the fingerboard, so if she were to leave her first finger down, she would have a more consistent hand frame and she wouldn't have to put down that finger again. So there's just a very slight inefficiency in the left hand technique there. Her bow hold looks really good because her pinky is on top of the stick and the rest of her fingers are gently curved over as well. So when holding the bow you want to make sure that all of your fingers have a nice gentle curve to them with bent knuckles and no excess tension. Her hand looks really relaxed and very natural as if she was picking up a glass or something. That's what you want your bow hold to look like and that looks really good. There are many grace notes that she's playing in this musical excerpt. So very quick decorative notes that go above the note and then go back down. And so she's playing these with a nice lightness in her fingers, and you can really hear the decorative elements of those grace notes. And they sound really beautiful and they really decorate the melody in a nice way that really draws in the listener's attention. So that was very musically done to have that ornament there executed well. She's using really nice and full bow strokes going all the way from the frog to the frog right here to the tip And so since she's using making use of all of her bow She's spinning out a gorgeous violin tone getting a lot of sound out of the instruments As she's playing this musical excerpt, the same musical material keeps coming back, and there's not a ton of variety. It sounds a little bit dry and a little bit not super varied in the different approaches, so it would be nice to hear a little bit more musical contrast every time this theme comes back. She's now in this new position, but her whole hand is just slightly flat. It's just a slightly bit, a little bit too close to the nut of the instrument. So she needs to actually move her hand up just a tiny, tiny bit to the left there to get her hand frame to be a little bit higher in pitch so that it's in tune. Her right hand is bowing really smoothly and gorgeously. Her hand still is remaining very relaxed and her fingers and her bow hold are very flexible. So as she's playing these really long tones with her right hand, she's using a lot of really fast note changes with her left hand, which does require a bit of coordination and the sound and the tone is very smooth. Her first finger is raising a lot unintentionally, so if you watch her left hand, she could keep her fingers even closer to the fingerboard and not lift up fingers when she absolutely does not have to. This is a really tricky kind of finger twister etude, and it's very good for practicing finger independence and just making sure that those fingers stay down and stay nice and light to the touch. Which she's doing mostly a really good job of, but there's just a few inefficiencies with certain fingers being raised when they don't have to be raised. Her first finger slid down the fingerboard as her bow sped up. And this is a very expressive... This is a very expressive slide down, and she's bringing this out to kind of draw some attention to this part of the music. Very cool. Her bowing is very smooth and connected. As she changes between bows, you can't really hear too much of a stop between the notes, so she's keeping a consistent bow speed and keeping her hand nice and relaxed as she's changing between downbow and upbow. The sound is very, very legato and smooth. The last run of those notes was a little bit uneven, and that could be just an issue of coordination between the right hand and the left hand. As she finished the piece, her bow left the string on that last up bow and it gave it this really nice fast release which really shot out the sound into the room and it just had a really nice dramatic conclusion. Beautifully done. The violinist is holding the violin on their shoulder at about a 90 degree angle here, which is great. They have an aligned spine and they are standing nice and tall. So right away their position shows that they are ready to make a great sound on the violin. She's doing a really good job of keeping her fourth finger in tune right here. That last chord that she played sounded really in tune in contrast to the one before. Nicely done. Just now she played two up bows in a row, so that direction and then that direction, and there was a little bit of a space between the two notes, so that's what's called a hook bow. And so she did that really beautifully. It was actually more like a lurai bow, so there was just a little bit of separation between the two notes, but that demonstrated some really nice bow control, and she used her entire bow, and you could hear the separation between the notes. She's using her left hand to do vibrato, so she's moving her arm a little bit back and forth to get a little wiggly sound from her fingers, and it sounds really nice. It's very beautiful and very warm, and she's consistently applying it across several different notes as she plays. As she's playing the second, third, and fourth finger notes, her pointer finger is off the fingerboard a little bit, and I think it would help with the hand frame if she kept her first finger down when playing the rest of these notes. A few of the pitches that she's playing are just a little bit slightly flat, but it's very hard to notice. It's not perfectly in tune, but it's very, very close to being in tune. As she's shifting to a new position, her pinky accidentally caught the D-string there and actually plucked it by accident. So that's that little plucking sound that you're hearing. It's just an accidental pizzicato with the left hand. The violinist is bowing in this nice contact point here. So the bow is halfway between the bridge and the fingerboard, which creates an ideal violin tone.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Again, the pianist chooses a reasonable tempo when they start, but as they're playing they start to speed up, which results in their mistakes. The pianist is trying to figure out the next notes. They should try to make sure that they practice their scales more frequently so that they're more familiar with the keyboard. Again, this is another example where they start to rush a little bit. They should just feel really grounded in their tempo and focus on the accuracy of playing the notes. Again, this is another example as they're getting further into the scale, especially this point, descending into the scale, that they're just speeding up. They should make sure that they practice with a metronome so that they have a very stable pulse. Again, this is another example that as they're playing, they're starting to rush a little bit, which is not helping them play more accurately. Again, the pianist is choosing to play scales at a tempo that's a little bit too fast for them. They're making mistakes, or they also start to test and play again notes that they've already played. It'd be best for them just to pick a tempo where they can play it straight through and very evenly. The pianist is playing with flatter fingers and their hands are a bit far away from the keyboard. They try to curve them and bring their hand a little bit closer to help their playing. If their fingers start to hit some of the other keys, it would be good for them just to practice one hand at a time playing this so they know exactly where their fingers should be going. The coordination and the balance in the hand is really off. You can see that these other fingers are a bit higher than the others. This is creating more tension in the hand. If they want to play with a more efficient hand, they can try to make sure that their finger and their whole hand is just very relaxed. You can see here, since they're playing with their pad of their finger and then playing hard that their first knuckle is caving in, if they were to play more with their fingertips they would have stronger fingers to be able to play the keys. As they're playing their scales, they're starting to rush a little bit.

It's very challenging to peel things that are this small. And now he has a peeler as well, a vegetable peeler. And now he's taken two halves of that, of those cuts, which I believe means he's got several layers in each half, and he's turned them flat side down, and now he's continuing to make cuts. He's kind of going on an extra level. He probably could have just cut it in half once and then use those flat sides to make his next cuts.

Not only in the arms that is helping the climber for the reach but it's also because the climber has continued to press the foot below being the one that is the only one in place. The climber was fully able to extend the leg and for the climber to not feel like they're going all about pressing that leg to gain height. It's also helped with balance with keeping the left leg on a drop but also driven into the wall to help keeping the climber close to the wall. The climber was able to fit the left hand onto the hold that he was matching and sends the right hand up. In order for doing this movement, the climber had to pull a close pull up again to his chest while throwing himself over right side for the reach. Now something that the climber did before going up for the reach was that he had swapped his feet to keep more pressure onto the right foot this time and let go of the left foot keeping the leg extended to help with balance. Now the climber by letting the leg be extended helps the climber to keep more force and more pressure holding all of the weight of the climber on the right foot. This the climber does by keeping the leg extended which is because of the foot being placed slightly on that angle it can throw the climber out left. The reason why the climber had to engage into a forceful pull up and throwing himself right in order to gain the reach to the higher hold. Here we can see the climber performing a paddle of the foot going forward and at the same time bringing the toe inwards onto the hold being readjusted in the moment that the climber was almost peeling off the wall. In this case the climber did hold on tight to the grips to avoid swinging out completely and as you can see he's engaging onto a pull up to bring himself forward in the direction that he needs to gain force to keep position of the foot. Here the climber has swept his feet, now this time keeping the left foot engaged onto the wall. This is going to be the one creating pressure, also keeps the climber close to the area or direction of movement. Now the climber has extended the right leg, this support with the balance as the climber was bringing the left arm up. As we can see the climber is keeping himself from falling all the way to the left by engaging the arm, keeping the pull up so that the climber doesn't fall out completely and is pressing down on the left foot to gain leverage. Also having the leg flagged out will help the climber to help with the twist of the body to keep the left side of the body close to the wall as it would support with the reach. Here the climbers is starting at a two hold start meaning that each hand has its separate holds and they are jugs meaning that there are positive grips. He can then lay back keeping the arms extended and trusting the grips above. Giving it enough pressure not engaging the arms saves the climbers energy so that when the climber needs to commit for the next move he can do a pull up to the next hold. Down below the climber is making a placement for the feet and the right foot is on the foot chip while the left foot is down just pressing against the wall. This also counts as being on the wall. The climber then will have to rise the core being the hips area and once the core is against the wall and all the weight is transferred to all of the limbs then the climb will start. Here the climber has done a series of small little pull-ups to gain momentum when on the throw. Once sending the right hand up for the jog above, this one being a big lip, can secure the climber to bring the grip over to the side and quickly adjust it by coming to the middle of it to secure the grip. As we can see the climber then now it's making the movement down below to gain higher stance by moving the right foot. Here, the climber then was able to bring the right foot to a high stance. The toe box is right now has sufficient surface to be on the big hold down below. And the climber then once pressing down on the foot was able to release the left foot and this one is out on as a tail to guide the climber with balance. This one so that the climber is able to transfer all of the weight over to the highest foot. Once this foot was secured, the right foot and the climber sends over the left hand to a match. Now since the right foot was the one being placed it was obvious that the right hand that was down below needed to come up and does this by matching the hold above. Matching is when both hands are placed into the same hold. Since the climber had extended the right hand first, then was able to keep the weight onto one of the feet by sending the right leg down. This is just for the climber to keep himself close to the wall or not coming off onto a pendulum effect. So he needs to keep at least one of the limbs and to move comfortably and transitioning to the right, bringing the left hand over to match at the last hold. Then that will help the climber with direction once he lets go to apply the right pressure as the climber in order to create pressure must lean on the hold both. Once the climber gets to hold the hold for about three seconds then the climb is done and the climber has finished the climb. Here we can see how the climber lets go of the feet from the placement and brings the right foot to be onto place quickly. He does comfortably letting go and swinging out to the left side due to the great grips that the climber is holding on to. Here we can see the climber has brought the left foot into a match down below and has quickly sent over the left hand to match with the right hand. Now what brought him over to the right side was the climber hold on tightly to the right hand and created a pull up motion to send over the left hand to join the match. Now the climber is quickly looking over at the next hold being the end hold of the climb. It needs to do this quickly so that the climber doesn't get off balance due to being in a position where he could potentially be pivoting over in a loose balance. Here, the white powder that the climber is spreading on his hands is chalk, which will help the climber to absorb any sweat may be coming from the hands and also to gain a better grip when on the wall. Here the climbers brought the right foot into a match and this will help the climber distribute the weight down on the feet. Now while the climber is leaning back, you can see how the climber is already bringing the left hand above the right hand and this both are in a match. And right now he is figuring out the position to fit both hands onto the same hold. Here we can see the climber as trying to bring the left foot into a placement. The right foot has popped off and slipped out of the hold. This, the climber will have to continue to hold forcefully to the grips above to avoid the swing out and presses tightly onto the foothold to not miss the foot. And transferring the weight quickly onto the highest foot will help the climber gain hopefully stability. Here the climber has done a foot swap. Now this he does by extending the right leg and pointing it out. This is not in any foot chips and this only be used for balance. Also while the climber brings the foot away from the wall, it helps the climber to keep the hips close to the wall. Now the left foot is the one that is being supported a hundred percent with the push of the climber staying out left. Now the the climber is pushing against the hold and this is so that can throw the body out left and also the climber is extending the leg so that instead of pushing down it's just pushing away from the hold so it'll stay the climber on left side. What's helping the climbers leverage is the grip that he has on and bending of the arm which is the pull up as well as him forcing a twist of the shoulder going upwards is what helps the climber get the grip at the reach that the climber needs to do in order to get the hold both. Here we can see how it was ideal of the climber to keep the left hand on place and performing a close pull up, keeping it towards the chest while being down on the feet on the mat. There isn't a wide stance for this, so the climber had to bring his hips over to the left side and then quickly move the right hand to sustain the unbalance. Here we can see how the climber in the moment that was going for the higher hold has sent the right hand up and had knocked a little bit hold on the way on his knuckles but gets to place the hand to lock the move on the right side and quickly adjusts it to the middle part of the hold where the climber has a better grip. Now the climber had moved the right foot over and this one has a little bit of a distance from where the climber is right now positioned. This the climber will need then to make sure that both of the feet are positioned where it will help the climber gain reach for the next hand hold that will be going up left side. Here the climber glances over to make a better placement of the toe on the foot chip. It's important that the climber gets to locate the exact area on that small chip as the climber may have to pivot or roll over his foot when standing up on the direction that the climber needs to go to. This to avoid any foot slipping and also to make sure he's applying the right pressure when needed once the foot gets to move over along the foot chip. Now as we can see the climber once gets to stand up on that foothold and the climber will have to engage the arms creating more pressure in the grips once gets to do a pull-up position motion.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This right leg could be back a little bit further and as well as bending the right knee so that way she's kind of sitting into the leg as she body rolls and in the same way she did a really nice body roll in the beginning that could also happen here from the feet up but the arms look great and she's looking forward to the audience. So up to here, the dancer continues to do a great job, keeping with the music, keeping the beat, and getting all of the steps done correctly and technically correct. And here in this pose, her arm is raised up to the sky and she is also looking to the direction of her arm. She could definitely probably tilt her head up just a little bit to follow more of the hand, but overall, good job up to this point. So the dancer starts with a salsa step forward and back. She could definitely go up on her toes a little bit more as she steps, but she does a good job keeping to the beat, keeping her knees nice and bent, and then a nice rotation in her arms and shoulders. So, a really great job. I think just that jump was a time where the movement could have been a little bit bigger. But overall, really good job with this one, really good example for this advanced choreography. So here's one of the points where she could have exaggerated the jump a little bit more. I think making the jump a bit bigger across the floor and then also opening up her legs a bit more to help her jump and get much wider across the floor and then that will just help to really ground her body roll in this step. So here in the beginning, the dancer steps out on her right foot, twists her body really well, and then continues to step into this body roll. It's a really nice fluid body roll from her head down to her feet. Her knees are bent really well, and she just moved all throughout her chest as she was flowing through, so really nice job.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Start slower, use a metronome to keep this nice and consistent. With some open string notes hit by accident here, a student could just pay more attention to which strings are actually strumming for each chord. The left hand switches between chords very, very quickly and efficiently. A little unclean here coming down I would say the finger of the left hand could supply a little extra emphasis on the note when they're changing rather than sliding between the positions of the instrument. fingering also is perfect. Any kind of major or minor scale is going to start with that second finger and go from there. These patterns switch between a constant fourth finger, actually stays on a constant fourth finger while they switch between a second or a third finger to get that harmony. And that technique looks good here. This arpeggio example is a really great example of practicing that lower octave, but they could do that in the other arpeggios as well. I'd also advise that possibly playing this pattern as arpeggios, starting more on the backside of the position, rather than staying exclusively up here. This way you can get practice in both spots. The seating position is a little far back. This is a very relaxed position for this musician. A rock guitar stance here with the instrument on the side. Arpeggios tend to be too fast anyway, I would just play these much slower to be cleaner and more precise with the shifting. There's a very particular picking technique for playing scales down, up, down, down, up, down, down, up, and then up, down, up, up, down, up, up, down when going between the strings, and you can see that clearly in his hand. Really nice finger acquisition here on the left hand, staying very close to the string, getting a good sound, thumbs in a good position.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She's able to engage the arms choreographically in a way that's meaningful, as well as embody the rhythm particularly in her feet while engaging her pelvis and her torso in a minimal but appropriate way. She would benefit from more movement in her pelvis and torso overall to help her with her movement dynamics and rhythmic embodiment, but overall here it seems like she has a basic understanding of the movement and in moments like this she appears confident and connected to the music. The dancer is able to perform the chaine movement, or this movement traveling from one side of the room to the other, with efficiency and clarity, particularly thanks to the spotting of her head and keeping her feet nice and close together directly under the pelvis. As she's holding this shape with her body, she's able to move through the space from one side to the other quickly, efficiently, and with clarity. As the dancer moves forwards and backwards in the space performing a fairly basic salsa step, she demonstrates that she has an understanding of the movement vocabulary and is able to incorporate choreography in both her arms as well as her legs. However, she would benefit from some additional movement in the pelvis, which would be increased by dropping that pelvis back and being more grounded in her movement and perhaps bending her knees a bit more. She also would benefit from some additional movement in the torso, perhaps in the shoulders, which at this moment are appearing quite stiff and disconnected from the rest of the body, which is holding back her possibilities for rhythmic embodiment. As the dancer performs this kind of circular gyrating motion with her shoulders, she has a nice bend in her knees though she would benefit from bending them even more and dropping that pelvis back to be more grounded in this moment. She would also benefit from increasing that range of motion in her shoulders and kind of loosening or freeing up her arms a bit to help her increase this range of motion. As the dancer performs this small jump, she struggles to stay connected to the music as well as perform it with technical integrity. As she's launching into this jump, she would benefit from bending these knees a bit more so that she's able to jump higher into the air. She would also benefit from utilizing her feet a bit more, which are a bit flat and not super engaged. She's not really rolling through her feet to get that height in the air. She's also twisting her shoulders over her pelvis in a way that's throwing her off balance and keeping her from being able to perform this kind of turning jump quickly and efficiently with technical integrity. As the dancer performs this really quick footwork into this fast kind of roll of the shoulders or upper body body roll, she struggles to move quickly while maintaining a connection to the rhythm as well as kind of a natural flow within her body. As she's performing this body roll of her shoulders, her shoulders appear quite stiff like she's not completing the movement fully and her arms are a bit oddly disengaged as she's performing this, which is making it harder for her to have that range of motion in her shoulders. And again, just as before, she would benefit from bending those knees more and dropping that pelvis back so that she's more grounded through her movement and able to move quickly, efficiently, and with clarity.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He should be leading this turn on his toe, so it makes his spin, his revolution around less fluid. He could be more fluid if he puts his weight onto his toe. Again, now the dancer is looking directly down. We see that he sees his feet, which is even worse than seeing his hand. We see how condensed his spine really is. So instead the dancer's spine should actually be in a straight line. He can do that by looking forward to begin with and then also pulling up from the base of his spine to the top of his head all the way outward. The dancer is looking a bit down, which is making his vertebrae condensed. We see that he sees his hand in the camera view, which might happen, but his hand should be lower in the view. It shouldn't be mid-level in the view that he sees his hand, and that's because his head is tilted downward, and he's looking downward. And as a result of his cervical spine and his neck tilting downward like that, his whole spine is a bit condensed. So he needs to look straight outward, and in doing so, he can also pull up from his head, from the base of his spine up through his head, so that he's taller in space. The dancer doesn't have much of a neck here. His shoulder in particular, his right shoulder is high. His left shoulder also is a bit high. He can push down both shoulders. He can keep his arms in the position they are, just move his shoulders downward so that he can extend his head upward into space so that he has more of a neck and can be elongated and taller in his verticality. The dancer is not really using his space appropriately whenever he travels back He gets very close to this back wall yet. He still has Such a great amount of space in front of him to use So really he should be centered perhaps on this dot that we see in the screen so that he can travel Both forwards and backwards equidistantly, but right now he's uneven He is More so upstage which in dancing means towards the back of the room He's very close to the back of the room so he can't actually travel appropriately The dancer has great energy when he's lifting his arms here. He's tapping his toes with again, a lot of energy. He's also pumping his chest. So he's using his full body here and that's great. He needs to keep this energy just while executing this beat taller. The dancer is supposed to be doing two steps in place with his feet together and then sliding outward and repeating that two steps in the center and sliding outward. However, the slides outward are non-existent. The dancer is not using his space appropriately and so he needs to learn how to travel. He should be having one when he's sliding to the left, his left foot should be planting on the floor going outward while his right foot then chases it. But he is not doing that, he only widens his feet slightly instead of actually moving and making this a step that transfers him to a different part in space. The dancer is stepping very heavily on his feet. He could be less heavy on his feet if he moved his weight onto his toes. That would help all these shifts outward and across to be more smooth. The way in which the dancer is rolling through his chest is really good. It's showing a smooth dynamic as he extends his arm forward. He is having a sequential roll up through his spine and he's engaging his chest. That's a great articulation of that body part there. I would like to say the dancer has great energy in his arms already. He always has one arm higher than the other Alternating with which foot he's using. So if he's using His left foot his right arm is higher in the air and in that way He's engaging his chest and his arms quite a bit. So that's good", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This is a good beta because it allows the climber to utilize the full hold for their right hand, so I think this is a good tweak on the climber. So here we have right hand on this start jug, and the climber is utilizing this hand-foot match down low on the left-hand start hold, looking up towards the target hold. Attempting to roll out, the climber just comes up short, going for this hold. This is a bad pinch, so I imagine the climber isn't able to control it to a degree that would allow them to go up to this hold with the necessary amount of control, and the climber falls as a result. And after a quick match on this start jug, the climber is able to get out to this left-hand pinch.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Monoholds are strenuous on the fingers especially because he was able to pull only on the fingers that were placed into the hold and it built a lot of pressure because the climber had to maintain into a closed grip while he continued to gain height and making especially a powerful move going up for their reach previously. So the climber right now sends the hand down. This will allow the climber to rest the hand and he shakes it in order to release any tension that has been built up. Whenever he's ready he will then stand up onto the feet being in place and pull himself in to make the higher reach up to the jug which seems to be a positive hold. In the moment that the climber made the high foot placement, placing the left foot against the big hold, which is no doubt that the climber has enough surface to keep pressure. The climber, when transferring the pressure, he had his right foot lose contact. So here the climber is now applying extra gripping power at the hands because of the climber's foot coming loose. This one was unintentional, so this tells me that the climber needs to also make sure he is able to be aware when transferring weight and continue to apply pressure at the feet. This is not a good technique because it can wear out the climber's grips and also because the climber will have to engage on a pull-up by engaging the arms to sustain such slip. The climber then sends the right foot into a high foot placement by sending the heel in towards the wall and behind the edge of the hold. This is called heel hooking because the climber will be able to pull on the hold with the heel and this will allow the climber to bring his center of gravity close to the wall since it's placed behind the jug. Also, later on when the climber needs to gain height, he can also not only pull but push down on the hold in order to transfer over the weight to the high foot. As the climber made the foot placement, this one driving force to the high foot, his right foot has slipped off from the wall, this because of the applied pressure. And the climber loses his center of gravity. This one, the climber quickly catches himself by sending his right hand down to the hold. And now the climber will have to engage on the core in order to gain a stability so that the climber can then bring his right foot back onto the wall. It seems as the climber was able to fit two fingers onto that small slot on the hold. So in order for the climber to sustain his grip, he slides the two fingers inside because he's able to apply them into the hold and will have to close the grip. Once he closes the grip, then he will have to create a pull-in position in order to sustain the grip. This is important that the climber is placing the grip appropriately as this is a strong one when the climber is making his way up due to being overhand, underhand. So when it's underhand, the climber is able to sustain the hold right now by pushing away from the wall. But once the climber starts gaining height while sustaining on the hold, the climber can still sustain it all the way down to his hips. Here we can see how the climber had brought the right hand to come into placement at the same hold. This is called matching. And he's only been able to fit a few fingers onto the match hold. So what he does is that he engages on a quick pull up. This will release some of the pressure on the left hand so the climber is able to bump it slightly to the left side in order to make space for the right hand to wrap around the hold. The climber is starting at a one-to-hold start. So the climber must place both of the hands in the same hold. This is called matching. And as we can see, the type of hold, the way that the climber is holding on to it is by applying the palms to be, the bottom of the palm to be pressed against the hold. So the climber is able to send the fingers from above by pressing on the fingertips towards the hold. This will help the climber to then engage on a powerful pull-up once the climber gets to raise his hips off from the mat. And once the climber transfers the weight over to the limbs, then the climb will start. If the climber was going to perform this again, he had originally placed the heel hook above the edge of the jug and it would have been ideal if the climber placed it further out in order to have the edge of the jug to be hugging the outside of the heel. The reason why the climber, when the foot dropped, the climber's heel hook did not have enough edge to be supported on, the reason why the climber's heel hook came off from place. The climber was able to make the reach of the right hand coming into place at a jug. This one is a safe hold because it's positive and the climber is able to apply the fingers over it, pull on the lip and apply the thumb to squeeze and creating pressure on the hold to secure the grip. As the climber made the reach, he had lost contact of his left toe coming off the wall. So it's important that the climber continues to pull onto the monohold by bringing the elbow close to the core, even if the climber's center of gravity is still slightly away from the wall. So the reason why the climber has continually pressed on the right toe in order to stay in place from going further out. The climber has brought left foot into a high placement and no doubt the climber can apply pressure onto the toe box of the foot to meet the hold. And as we can see the climber is bringing the left hand to come into place onto a mono hold. It's a mono hold because the climber has only a small entry where only one finger is able to be applied inside of the hold. The climber was able to transfer over the left hand to the last hold and was able to do this due to securing the heel hook. Once the climber had secured the heel hook, he was sustaining to three points of contact on the wall which allowed him to release the left hand to go up for the last hold. Here the climber must hang on to the grips tight while making the foot switch. This is because the climber needs to release some of the pressure down below, but also continually to create pressure on the hold by placing the left toe on top of the hold. Once the climber gets to create pressure, the climber then is able to release the right foot from the foot hold. The climber quickly had brought the left toe into placement at the big hole down below. And also quickly the climber sensed after the foot placement the left hand to come into match. Both of the hands right now are holding onto a small rail. This is shallow so the climber is engaging onto a hand grip that's called crimp. As we can see the knuckles are sticking out. The climber places the fingertips as far in into the hold almost meeting the wall. And is creating friction at the fingertips and pressure by cupping the grips with the thumb towards the edge. He then is pulling in and maintaining a very close grip where it meets with the ball, the top bolt of the hand towards the edge. And he is pulling it in by also forcing the grip with keeping a tight pull where his elbows are slightly placed and engaged on a light pull up. This one the climber needs to make sure that he continues to give force onto the grips until he is able to make the next placement. Now that we can see the climber has brought his center of gravity to be as far up also engaging the pull. Down below we can see how the climber's left leg has been extended and this one the foot is pushing against the wall. This will help the climber to sustain the position between the two areas of support that are on the wall in order for him to make the hand placement. The climber was able to make the right foot placement onto the wall and before this the climber needed to sustain on that pull up with the grips in order to tense the body once the climbers swing Was decreasing then the climber was able to then make the foot placement Now the climbers glancing over at the next hold to be at reach Due to wanting to move out of this position that he's crunched up Here the climber was checking off his hands and this will help absorb any sweat that may be coming from the hands as well as gain a better grip when going to the holds. And as we can see the climber shakes the hands this is to release any tension that might be build up on the hands from previously climbing and also helps the climber to warm up the hands by shaking them. It's important that when the climber is doing a foot placement he glances down at the feet. In this case the climber is now bringing the right toe to come into place where the left foot is. He must apply pressure on the toe against the hold before releasing the left foot and he does this by sustaining on the grips with more pressure to allow releasing some pressure down at the feet but continually creating pressure at the hold to not lose contact with the hold. Here the climber is sending the right hand onto a shake. This will help the climber to release any buildup that has been applied to the grid. Also keeping the arms extended helps the climber to regenerate the muscles and any tension that has been build up. As he performs the rest he also is able to glance at the wall to check what would be the next move on the sequence and when the climber is ready then he will make a hand placement either to match or to the next move. As the climber was doing the back flag, the toe has bumped against the hold and this through the climber's position where the foot now is no longer creating that force to be elevated. When he dropped the foot, the climber's right foot has come out of place which was the heel hook and this will be an immediate drop of his weight which would not be sufficient for the climber to sustain the grips since the grips are right now staying with friction and accurate pressure when extending the arms. So the climber coming down would be really difficult for the climber to sustain the move. Here the climber needs to go to the next hold being at reach. So he places the right foot into a high placement when it was down below flagging, meaning that there wasn't any placement on that right foot, and brought it into a high stance quickly to adjust the hips over to the right side to make sure that the climber is able to transfer the weight over to the highest foot. And as we can see, the climber relies on the grip by extending the arms, which will relax the arms for a second while the climber glances over at the hold at distance. And when the climber is ready, he will then engage into a forceful pull up so that once the climber's chest reaches the grips, the climber is able to send the right hand up and bring his core or hips over the highest foot in order to sustain going up for the reach. Here the climber has released intentionally the left foot from placement. This so that the climber is able to extend the left leg, this one being flagging out, which will help the climber to transfer over the weight to the foot being in place. Now it's important that the climber keeps the flag out because it helps the climber to keep his center of gravity close to the wall, meaning that it will support with the climber's twist going out to the right because it helps with the climber staying with his right side towards the wall when going up for the reach. Here the climber was able to make the reach out placing the left hand onto the jug. This is a jug because the climber can comfortably wrap the hands, the fingers around the lip of the hold and as soon as he secures the placement he's able to pull on the grip by keeping the elbow out to engage it onto forcing the grip to sustain himself in place. Now in order for the climber to get to this hold he had initially pushed down on the right foot that is placed against the wall and has extended. The moment that the climber has extended the leg then the center of gravity is transferred over to the highest foot. Also this leg being extended and pushed away and pushed against the wall helps the climber with going with the direction when going out for the reach. Here we can see the climber sending the left leg to be extended. This is called a back flag where the climber is folding the leg behind the foot being in place. So he first had it flagged out and quickly has sent slowly and then with control to be released towards the right side. That to allow himself to bring his center of gravity low to extend the left arm as the climber needs to continually apply pressure of the grip on that open hand and slanted hold where the climber needs to create pressure by having friction of the skin towards the flat edge of the hold and places the thumb on the outside to keep the grip in place. The back flag would allow the climber to transfer the weight over to the high placement of the hand and the heel hook is strong to stay in place bringing his center of gravity close to the wall when bending the leg. So the climber here will need to release the right hand from place in order to match at the last hold reason why the climber is performing this position. The climbers are starting at a sit-down start. A sit-down start meaning that the climber is seated on the mat and places the hands and feet onto the wall. Once the climber has made the placements, then he will need to rise his hips towards the wall, weighing, transferring the weight over to the limbs. It usually is known that sit starts add a grade of difficulty to the climb due to starting in this position.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

His knee is now facing to the left side of the room. He's turning his knee inward, which is not necessary. He shouldn't have any twisting of the leg, either to the outside or to the inside here. His leg should just be properly aligned with his knee facing forward and not turning to face the side. The dancer is twisting his torso here. His upper body or his torso is twisted to his right while his arms are pointing towards his left. And so they're not properly aligned. His torso should really be completely forward and his arms should be forward in front of him, not off to the side. The dancer's turn should take four counts. He should be walking one, two, three, touch four, or walking five, six, seven, touch eight, but instead he takes five counts for this turn. So now anything that he does is going to be a count behind in the music because right now his feet are together and touching and he's about to step outward. And now his step outward is going to be happening on the second measure of the beat instead of the first. So now anything he does here on forward is going to be off rhythm. He's going to be one count behind because he took one extra step on that turn when he turned around. He took five steps instead of four steps. The dancer executes his directions again correctly here. He travels first to his right, then he turns around his left shoulder to face the back, then he turns around his right shoulder to face the front, and now he travels again to his left. So he travels to his right, turns around his left shoulder, that's traveling to the left, turns around his right shoulder, traveling to the right, and then goes outward to the left. So he is going here right, left, right, left, and his directions are great. Walking across 1, 2, 3, 4, turning 5, 6, 7, 8, turning 1, 2, 3, 4, and back out 5, 6, 7, 8. The dancer's arms are out to the side. Instead, his arms should be in front of him, and they should be moving with his legs moving. So when he moves his right leg, he should be moving his left arm a bit downward. And when he moves his left leg, he should be moving his right arm a bit downward. So his arms should be alternating between lower and higher, but they should be in front of him, not at his sides as they are here. Not only are her his hips not going in opposition, they're going in the same direction, but even as he is moving his hips incorrectly in terms of direction, he's still not also moving them largely enough. So his hips are moving side to side slightly as he's doing this basic bachata step right and left, but really his hips should be moving further out with every step. And we should see a hip movement. It should be very clear to the eye to see his hips moving from side to side. That should be obvious. His arms continue to not do much I understand he's lifting one of them Sometimes alternatively to turn a ghost partner, which is not there but independent of these turns His arms are not doing much and they really should be moving up and down in front of him, which Could help if he had some movement in his ribcage Horizontally right and left just like his hips should be moving right and left which they aren't really But moving his hips and moving his ribs would help initiate some arm movement as well instead They're just hanging there for the most part The dancer does a great job in terms of direction again here before he was facing the back of the room and Traveling to his right then he turned around his left shoulder to face the front and now he's moving again To the right which is now our left side of the screen since he is facing forward so he moved right and then left and then right which is great directionally and Rhythmically when he went to the right he went one two three touch four He turned around his left shoulder five six seven touch eight and now he's starting again to the side on his left on count One so he is on rhythm and directionally in the right correct direction here The dancer also turned taking the appropriate amount of steps. So when he was walking to his left, he walked one, two, three, touch four. He turned around on five, six, seven, touch eight. That way he could start again traveling to his left on count one. So he is on rhythm here. We also see further here this twist of his torso and an extension of his arms to the side in the ego view. We see that his right arm is in the air and it's pointing towards the left and really if he had a partner when she was turning here his hand should be directly in front of him instead of towards his left side. The dancer is on good rhythm here in this basic step. Going to his left on counts 1, 2, 3, tapping on count 4, then going to his right on counts 5, 6, 7, and tapping on count 8. The dancer is still one count behind as previously mentioned because he took an extra step on a turn before So right now it's count eight and his feet should really be together, but his feet are apart Because he's really up to what would be count seven on the rhythm of count eight So he is one count behind in the music Again, the dancer continues to turn his knees and with some rotation. So now his knee is facing to our left side of the screen or to his right. And really his knee should be facing straight forward, not turned to a diagonal or to the side in any which direction, whether it's inward or outward. Right here it is inward, but either inward or outward are both incorrect. His knee should just inside be facing completely forward. The dancer does a good job on executing directions here. He was traveling before to his left or our right side of the screen. And then as he turns around, he turns around his right shoulder to face the back of the room. And then he wants again, travels to his left. So he traveled to his left, turning around his right side and then travels again to his left. And that way he's traveling left, right and left. And that is correct. The dancer never got back onto rhythm and he remained one count behind from this mistake that he made prior in the music. He remained in timing in terms of all the steps he did, did take four counts. However, just wasn't in timing with the music. He remained one count behind in the music. But he maintained a steady dance in terms of he did remain only one count behind in the music. That was stable. He didn't get further behind in the music. Just instead he should have caught this mistake and got him back on the music instead of remaining one count behind it. If we look at the ego view, his eyes are moving around a lot. We see this camera shaking quite a bit and in different areas of the room. Right here he's looking downward. We see his hands in the screen, which makes it obvious that he's looking downward. And the dancer shouldn't be looking downward like this. He should be looking outward, straightforward. But also his eyes shouldn't be darting between left and right to different areas of the room. It should be one scan of complete forward, just going horizontally sideways in the direction that he's traveling. So when he's traveling to his left, our right side of the screen, his eyes should be at the same plane, just traveling in that direction. And when he's going to his right or our left side of the screen, the ego cam should be scanning completely at the same level, just to panning across horizontally. So because it's moving around quite so much, we can tell that his head is doing some extra movements that are not necessary and that are distracting. And it disallows his spine from being aligned. Instead he's now bending here at the head. So his spine is bent forward here on the top instead of his spine should be in a straight line. The dancer is not moving his hips in opposition of his legs. When he's stopping here with his left foot, his hips should be moving to his right. Instead, his hips are moving in the same direction as his foot, which is not correct. They should be going in opposition from his feet.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And this climber did quickly switching the feet, going down onto the two holes below and then has gone up for a quick sprint while keeping the left toe in place and sends the knee inwards. Again the knee drop and the right leg has been extended, also tapping the wall to support the climber, keeping the hips close to the wall. And this can help the climber to have more extension when going for the reach. As we can see the climber has made the move out left, this one being a pinch. When pinches are closed grip, the climber is able to engage more force onto the pinch. And as we can see the climber was able to pick up the right foot and instead of placing it into a hold, was pressing it against the wall. This one so that can keep the climber with balance and instead driving all of its force over to the left toe. Since the climber is bringing their center of gravity over to the left side for then the climber to bring the reach. As seen, the climber was actually able to hang on to the grips but not as tightly as he could have due to when making the move for the left foot, the foot has swung out and quickly made the placement onto the mat, ending the climb. And the future of the climber was to do this move. They need to keep their court tighter in order to avoid having the left foot swing out as he makes the placement. Here we can see the climber has gone ahead and shocked their hands. This is for the climber to have a better grip when on the wall and also will help the climber to absorb any sweat that may be coming from his hands. Here the climber spends some time to locate a foot placement for the right foot on the wall and was doing this but sustaining a pinch down below with the right hand and also was had the hand placed in a different way where the thumb before was wrapping onto the right side of the hold and while the climber was trying to position the foot the climber then slightly had turned the hand inwards to then make the thumb placement on the other side. The climber at first when they got to the top reach had placed the hand with the middle finger above and the two fingers on one side and the thumb on the right side. It was an awkward way of holding on to the pinch but it was the best that the climber could do at that moment since it was completely extended towards the wall when at the reach so the climber was using the right hand to pull himself in while placing the foot and when engaged the arm with much closer the climber was able to turn the top hand inwards in order to have a better grip. As the climber was doing this the climber then has placed a foot positioning for a higher hold but wasn't able to sustain the grip which is the reason why the climber left foot has stepped out of the wall. The climber quickly have swapped their left toe with the right toe and this is so that the climber is able to make the position and place for the reach. The climber needs to keep the right side towards the wall to help gain reach and does this by sending the right knee over pointing out left. When the knee is pointing the opposite direction as inwards is called knee drop and the climber does this to keep the right side towards the wall. Now the other leg being the left leg extended is called flagging out and the climber also does this by pressing the toe against the wall to help generate force to keep the hips towards the right side. Here we can see the climber positioning the hands onto the one start hold. When both hands are in the same hold, this is called matching. Also, once the climber gets to bring their right foot onto the wall, then the climber starts.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So it seems like she's really just focused on this hold, this hand, and this left foot, but everything's going to kind of come from that right foot and really driving up through that hold because that hold's really just not going to do anything until she's above it.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

I think some of the steps could be a little bit grander but otherwise really nice job with the jump and still rotating and moving her body around as she jumps side to side. I think when she turned around it could have been a much quicker snap around just to get back to the front. It was lagging just a little bit. I think with her level of energy and technique I think she could have got around much cleaner just to really snap to get around to face the front. So here overall, I think she had a really great performance. I just think it was a few just small moments that could have been a little cleaner, just the details for this advanced choreography, but otherwise really nice overall. So here's where I noticed a little slip up in her balance as she kicked her leg around and got into this position. This right foot was not as grounded to the floor so she took a small little hop and just almost lost her balance in that moment. So making sure I would say bend this knee a bit more so you're really stable in that step and then you are able to just rotate this left leg out in as she did. But really nice arms lifted up over the head and eyes are straightforward so otherwise the body looks great there. The dancer starts kind of the pre-choreography with just some steps, also steps front and back. She has a really great energy that matches the intensity of the music and her knees can be slightly bent just a little bit more as she steps and even when she steps back just keeping those knees constantly bent and loose but really nice energy in the upper body as her arms rotate around. So here when she rolls back, I would like to see the same intensity of the body roll as she had in the beginning. Again, bending those knees would help a lot right here. And then really stepping back on this right foot and lifting up that heel. The arms are nice. Her eyes are straight forward. But definitely bending the knees would have helped to get a better roll in her body. So here just a small detail when she jumps out I think her eyes could have looked up at the arm just to keep that that full motion as where she our body is going so not forgetting that your head is also part of your body so sometimes just a turn of the head can make a world of a difference in a step. So here in the first eight counts, just really nice body roll all the way down from her head to her toes, keeping those knees bent as she rolls through, but you see the full movement and roll throughout her body. So really nice job there.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Definitely some moments where I felt like she could have just really slowed down a bit, even though the music is fast, but really do the full movement and not cut it off. And I think that really definitely elevated her performance. So here, really nice job with just stepping out and touching together. She had a really nice flow in her body, so just really kind of moving like a, almost like jello in a sense, just really wavy and flowy, really nice. Also in this walk forward, it looks like she was flat on her feet, so make sure you're up on the balls of the feet for that part. So here, when she reached her arm down, I really wanted her to lunge out and really open her legs out and then reach all the way down to the floor. That's one of the moments where she cut off the movement and could have just made it fuller if she just kind of took her time in that movement. So here the only thing I'd say about these parts is just watch her feet. Trying to not keep them flat the whole time, really just stepping on the balls of the feet so that way your movements are much lighter. So nice job on the turn. I felt like she could have added just a little bit more energy around. It kind of started to slow down and stop for a second, but she made it back around. Definitely want to make sure you push enough force around to get your spins as long as you need them to go. So here as she rolls her arms around, I noticed this arm felt a little just kind of short, so not really extending it out. So definitely extend your arms out so it looks like big circles turning around. So here the dancer starts off really well. She is hitting all the steps correctly and staying on beat and everything looks great so far. So here in this front salsa step, definitely could have made that bigger as far as her arms, really rolling them around, also adding some hip movements to the side. It just felt really stiff in this moment. So here she's stepping forward. Her twist felt a little off, so making sure if the left leg is forward as it is right now, she would twist her body to the right. If the right leg is forward, she would twist her body over to the left. So just making sure that is the right way. And up to here again so far, really great job. She's staying with the music and really just has a nice flow throughout her body. Her energy is just really mellow, but it definitely works because she's kind of dazing to the musical part of it. So really nice job so far.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

It would definitely help to pause in between each exercise, look through the first pattern of pitches, think about the finger style pattern before playing right away, to get more success on the first attempt with this phrase. Here the highest pitch in this phrase was muted. It would help to check on the pinky in the left hand and make sure that the finger pad is pushing in the center of the fret directly on top of the string and away from the metal bar of the fret to get the clearest possible sound. It would help to practice the first phrase in this exercise multiple times at a slower tempo to review the pattern of pitches that is needed and also to review the finger style pattern in the right hand to get more comfortable with this phrase and more success when first attempting it. There was also difficulty here with the right hand finger style pattern. Again here it could help to just practice the finger style pattern for this exercise using the open strings, then add the cords back and perform the alternating pattern again slowly to get more comfortable with the alternation of the right hand fingers. Here another incorrect pitch was played and the phrase is being restarted. Here an incorrect pitch was played multiple times. The guitarist then restarted their phrase with the correct pitch to fix this mistake. During this exercise the guitarist had good accuracy with their chord shapes in the left hand fingers and also had more success and accuracy with the finger style pattern in the right hand. Here an incorrect pitch was played. It would help to just practice the first chord while strumming all six strings. Switch the second chord, strumming all six strings, go back and forth a few times to get comfortable with these two shapes and shifting from one chord to the other, and then go back and add the finger style pattern while playing each of these chords at a slow tempo to get more accuracy with the pitch and shifting from one chord to the next. Again here there was a lot of hesitation with the right hand and the finger style pattern. It would definitely help to take the open strings and focus on just watching the right hand fingers, getting more accurate aim and consistency when playing this pattern multiple times in a row. Then slowly add the cord shapes back, continue to practice this pattern at a slow speed multiple times to get more accurate and comfortable with the alternation of the right hand fingers when playing the strings one at a time. Here the aim of the right hand thumb when strumming. The string was a bit off and needed to be adjusted. It would help to keep an eye on the right hand fingers when playing this finger style pattern. The guitarist has started playing another exercise. So far their pitches are being played accurately. You can see left hand fingers one, two, and three are curved and pressing towards the center of the frets, but the left hand thumb is starting to reach around the side of the guitar. This can be problematic, especially if it starts to push on the strings on the front of the fret board, so it would definitely help to reposition the thumb and move it more towards the back of the neck. Here an incorrect pitch was played, but the guitarist kept going and maintaining their steady tempo. The guitarist is now performing the right hand pattern with more success. They just performed it three times in a row with the correct alternation of the right hand fingers playing each string. The guitarist is beginning one of their exercises. You can see the left hand fingers are curved and pressing towards the center of the frets. They are playing the strings one at a time using their right hand thumb, pointer, and middle fingers. The guitarist is demonstrating proper left hand finger position. You can see the fingers are curved and pressing down towards the center of the frets and the thumb is on the back of the neck of the guitar. Here, another error in pitch was made, and this phrase needed to be restarted. Here there was a lot of difficulty and hesitation with the finger style pattern. It would help to even play this pattern with open strings a few times while watching the right hand fingers and then add the chord shape back and play the pattern multiple times in a slow tempo then gradually work it up to speed while keeping an eye on the fingers to get more successful at the alternating pattern. Here, a slight error was made in the fingerstyle pattern, but the guitarist quickly corrected it and is moving on with the rest of the phrase without losing any speed to their tempo. The beginning of this phrase needed to be attempted multiple times. It would help to review the beginning of this phrase and the pitches and strings that are needed here. Play them a few times at a slow tempo to get more familiar with them and also be able to play them more accurately on the first try when starting this phrase. The guitarist is continuing to demonstrate an improvement in pitch and is slowly getting more comfortable with the finger style pattern the more they are performing and practicing each of these exercises. Here there was an error in the alternating right hand finger style pattern. This mistake was not corrected and the guitarist is continuing on.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And that's because there's not a lot of sensitivity that you're able to have the further up the key you are. So having a more natural curve to the fingers will put your fingers lower down in the key and you're going to have more control of the key in that position. We're hearing some inaccuracies with these shifts on each arpeggio. That again will be fixed by using a fingering that involves a crossover. But if you do use this fingering, you have to shift fast but then be slow at the last moment so that you accurately come down on the right note. You can't have the shift be full speed all the way until you're pressing down the note because it's just going to increase the possibility for inaccuracy. So taking this at a slower tempo would help. We're losing on that last arpeggio some consistency of articulation, specifically the notes being played with the first finger on the right hand and the fifth finger on the left hand are coming out as much heavier than the others. You just have to be careful about that. We hear a big gap in between these two arpeggios. It's because the pianist is not using a fingering where the first finger crosses under in the left hand and the third finger crosses over in the right hand. So using that fingering will allow you to connect these two arpeggios. We'd like to hear the pianist play this at a slower tempo so that he would be able to make these shifts in time, because now we've lost the pulse. So we'd rather have a slower tempo with a good pulse than a faster tempo with no pulse. The pianist has good consistency of articulation throughout these arpeggios. We hear that the notes have a similar start to them and a similar length to all of them, so that's very good. We'd like to see these wrists a little bit higher. We can see that they're sitting below the keys of the piano, which is causing the fingers to outstretch more than they need to. So a little higher wrist, a little more curve to the finger.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Again, the dancer is looking at the corner for a clue before she does the next dance step. And really the dancer should be focused forward, especially since she's about to do a turnaround. She wants to be spotting where it is that she's going to end up and shouldn't be looking into the corner right now. The dancer's shoulders are very fluid. She's alternating up and down with each shoulder and as she's doing that she's also alternating her hands from up and down and that is really great that she is not stiff in her shoulders and is also using them to further explore the salsa dance steps. She's embellishing it with style here. The dancer adds some stylistic and choreographic elements of her own here. She brings her hands to her hips right prior to this and now brings her hands to her head. These are artistic choices that she is choosing. They're not necessarily in the choreography. She's choosing to style her arms like that and it gives us a sense of who she is. It's nice that she is adamant about this choice. She definitely places her hands in a specific position of her choosing. The dancer's last extension of her left arm is bent. She doesn't actually complete a full vertical line above her. Even though this is the last version of this dance step, it's the last time she's doing it, she should still be doing it as fully as she did the other ones preceding it. The dancer reaches a fully stretched vertical position with her hand, which is wonderful. The dancer can have more energy in her arm movement here as she brings them or swings them down and up. She can do that with more emphasis and eventually straighten her arms. It's okay that they do bend here but they should reach a straight position at some point before they bend. The dancer should be ending this turn looking forward. It changes the shape of her body when she looks to the side and also it's a way to get dizzy or not complete the turn fully. She wants to really do a 360 degree turn but she doesn't or she risks not completing the turn when her head is looking to the side because normally her body would also be facing wherever her head is. It's good that she's actually able to isolate her head from the rest of her body but it's very easy for your body to follow suit whatever your head is doing. So if she does look into this corner it risks that her shoulders and her hips would also face this corner and then instead of doing a 360 degree revolution of a turn she would end up doing maybe like a 6 eighths of a turn so or maybe 7 eighths probably a bit more than 3 quarters but yeah she's risking not completing the turn fully by looking in that corner. The dancer's shoulders are also very well coordinated when she steps with her left foot her left shoulder also goes down The dancer seems to already be looking at the corner of the room into the mirror for clues perhaps from her teacher So it shows that she's struggling Already to memorize the routine and might need help as she goes through it", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I would encourage the dancer to spot and look the direction they intend on going to create very consistent patterns on the floor. I would encourage this dancer for the step-step touch to plie even more so then they can use their hips on a pendulum swing. Here I will repeat my earlier comments about grounding, about hip articulation, about power and strength through the movement, about using the back and extending through the arms, all of that wonderful stuff. I think this dancer could articulate their hips even further and swivel them, and they can do that by, of course, pli\u00e9ing their legs so they have more range of motion to be able to move those hips.

So here he's moving side to side. He does a little better at picking up his feet but just not as much. I would definitely say maybe bend those knees a little bit more and really get the hips into the movement going side to side. They should be also pushing side to side as well. So, not bad with this one. He definitely gets the basics of the movement, just he has to pick up his feet when doing this style of dance because everything shouldn't be so flat and weighted to the floor. It should be much lighter and a bit airy and up on your toes, bending your knees, but just much lighter in the movement. So here the dancer is starting with his just doing the same rhythm. So the one, two, three, one, two, three. One thing I noticed is he's keeping his feet on the floor. So the only time he picks it up is the first step, but then his toes remain on the floor and he's just moving from his heels. So definitely getting those toes up. It should be a step, step, step, not just picking up your heels to and like bending your knees more. Your knees are still bent, but he has to pick up his feet off the floor. Do she or tap, tap, tap to get the correct step. So I do like his turns. He definitely did a nice little spot with his head in the first turn and whipped his head around to get around. I think he might have went on the wrong foot to go back the other direction. I think he just needed to, when he steps forward, step right back on his left foot so that way it's already stepping back and he can easily spin around. He took kind of an extra step so he ended up stepping with the other leg so it just wasn't as smooth as it could have been. So he's now stepping forward and back. Good job rotating those arms around. And then again, I would say, yeah, pick those feet up just a little bit more because they're just kind of dragging and it brings the energy down to the floor. So here again, the only time he picks up his foot is when he's stepping out. That's when his foot actually picked up off the floor. But this toe should also move off the floor when he's stepping on his left foot. But otherwise, good job with his arms rotating those around and staying on the beat.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Now it's important that the climber focuses on the limb that will be forcing the stand last, which is the right foot. So once the climber gets to shift his center of gravity to be over the right side, once gaining sufficient height and the climber presses on the right foot, then that will help the climber have more force when going up for the reach. The climb will start until the climber gets to place his hands and feet on the wall and he's no longer touching the mat. In this case, the climber is starting at a two-hand hold start. The hands being placed on donut holds, meaning that the climber is able to place his fingers on the inside of the hold and wrap the thumb around it. The thumb will help him create some pressure to sustain the grip as a pinch. And the feet position on the wall will help the climber to push and create pressure in order to raise his core or his hips against the wall. That way the climber will then have to sustain his body weight when sustaining the holds on the wall. If the climber was going to do this again, he would consider swinging a bit more forcefully before executing the leap, meaning that the climber will need to make sure that once he brings his chest over that he is more in the air, gaining a certain height before pressing on that right foot in order to make the reach up to the hold. When holds are new, they usually need to get a chalk up. So in this case, the climber has attempted this climb before and knows the area where he will need to place the grip. After some time of trying it, the pores might have run out of chalk. So the climber is re-chalking with the chalk sock by smearing it over the areas where he will need to have grip again. The climber has pressed the right foot and in this instance has brought the direction of his hips already going away from the wall. This will make it hard for the climber to obtain friction or gripping power when reaching the hold. That's if the climber gets to reach the hold. It's important that the climber lets the hips follow the direction of where the chest going into the wall was performing before at the leap. So if the climber slightly waited to gain height, then the climber will be able to have a more successful reach. Here, the climber keeping the arms extended applies pressure on the grips. And he's keeping his center of gravity low. This to transfer the weight as he swings left and right to the feet that are placed on the wall. In this case, the right foot is the one that is placed the highest. And in order for him to create swing momentum to go out left, he will be pressed down on the right foot. And if he swings out to the right, he will create pressure onto the left foot. In this moment, he's building momentum by swinging side to side to commit after creating energy to go up for a dynamic move to the next hold. The next hold is a distance. So the climber right now needs to focus on how he supports his weight over the hands and feet. And right now he's aiming up to see exactly in which area over the edge he wants to go for. Once the climber is ready, then he will commit to make a dynamic stance. This one to be a leap since that's at reach. And then execute the move as he makes his movement up. Doing so is important. The climber brings his chest towards the wall so that the hips can follow. And when he brings his center of gravity with him and the direction that he needs to, then he will have an easier time going with his right hand to place it on the hold above. He does the same thing down below. This is the foot placement for the right foot. So make sure that the climber has enough chalk to create gripping power between the rubber of the sole of the shoe and the hold. As it's porous, the climber then will be able to get rid of anything that might seem to be slippery to make it grippy again.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He ends up kind of trying to get the top of his toe. He just isn't able to make the heel work. I think that's because of the hand placement. But he commits to it, which eventually does cause him to slip because he can't really toe hook from that angle or toe scum on there. And so he ends up falling off. Now even when he's on that foot, he isn't slipping off of it. It looks like he's pulling quite hard with his arms, so he doesn't look super relaxed and not really taking the weight as much to his feet. So to start he looks good he's really keeping his arms straight not pulling his way through at the moment but then the first thing is it seems like he's kind of trying to get as high as possible right away which causes him to kind of put his right foot matching his left hand which is gonna cause a match in the future so he could have got matches feet on the lower hold where his left foot is currently and then got his left foot up right away and save himself a foot movement. So I like his thought process here with this high right heel. None of the feet are really set up to push down. His bottom left foot's on the slopey undercling and this is kind of the next handhold. The move he's going to is this kind of blocky pinch which isn't the most positive. The only adjustment I would make is, well one, I like that he's staring down the heel hook as he's making it. If I was him, I would kind of move this right hand to the left and be on this left-hand side of this hold right about here. Just so he doesn't have to bring his arm around. Right now you can see he's kind of setting his heel on his hand which is going to kind of complicate things. Then for the second move, he's kind of towing in and he is towing and looking at it so that So good for him for like really staring down this foot and getting this foot because it isn't undercling So it's gonna be quite slopey on top, but he's kind of towing in on the left side Where there is that spike? But I think with towing in you can see just how like high he has to get this toe and just how much his knee is Kind of coming out. So I think the move here would be to throw a heel hook on there And really pull your hips into the wall because you can see just how far his hips are out away from the ball", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He isn't able to kind of keep the tension through his feet and so he kind of cuts his feet and swings out away from the wall. It's kind of right off the bat, it's kind of a small detail with this left foot. Looks pretty angled so he's going to have to maintain a lot of tension against it. As you can see his leg is kind of, his foot is kind of perpendicular to where the positive edge is. So as he moves up it's going to be a little bit harder to keep that foot on because it is having to go in at that angle. And then not sure if the route ends here if this is part of the moves But if this is the end is that master you can see he's kind of setting his toes up here So he needs to kind of replace his his feet his hands with his feet That's using these like to kind of double toe hooks so that he can release his hands and kind of it's called a bad hang so he's gonna have to kind of flex his toes down and use the top of his shoes to grip this hole so he can go hands-free and move his hands both down to this hole down here or Maybe the row continues, and I don't know the rest of it. Whatever reason yeah, this this move is kind of interesting and Not sure it looks like maybe he just doesn't have enough toe rubber on the shoes I made that twice slips out because overall looks like the the hold is pretty good and positive in the feet are in good position And he looks engaged on it And you can see as he kind of gets higher on it, you know, as his foot kind of starts coming more at a downward angle, and he gets kind of more spread out, he does cut his feet and is able to keep that tension on there. So that's kind of good on the rail setter, is kind of having him move away from that hold and have to force him to use a higher hold. You can kind of see them eliminating that hold.

And as that elbow started to stretch open, the climber brings in this left arm, and they are able to hold this circular swing, which is great. It's nice to see this dyno get done this way, and a really good initial setup for the climber, and definitely a good grab on this target hold. Climber is then able to campus out into this double scoop jug and this is a great hold. You can see the laser pointer here. So it's basically just jugs to the top after this dyno.

I don't know if they forgot, if he forgot what he's supposed to be doing or if it's just because he's kind of in a weak, he's just kind of weak in general, his muscles are not super strong. He's not keeping a good frame. This dancer is keeping a great frame so you can see he's got this great upright posture and he's able to use his muscles to pull the leader towards him. You can see from this position that this dancer is really, really weak in the upper body, and that's a big reason that he's not a very effective follower. This is, this posture, his posture here you can tell is a little bit kyphotic because he's gazing towards the floor a little bit. This arm, the position here, the angle here, and then this, the position of these joints look super, super weak, so it's unclear, it'll be unclear to the follower what's meant to happen. This is also a really weak position. Typically, when the leader is facing away from the follower, but they're holding hands in this way, typically the leader's hand is fully flat on his own shoulder to keep it really strong in the foundation. This bend of the wrist here in the air is not a strong foundation, so once again, the leader is not very strong, and so the follower is having a hard time following. I also, again, suspect that the follower's not used to following, so it's compounding, and it's making them look really, it's making them be really uncoordinated with each other. Good coordination with the feet again. So once again going back and forth They kind of have this one down this back and forth one two, three one two pretty well down Especially when they're in this open position Really low strength again through this arm You can see this hand is just barely even touching this dancers back a good leader will have a flat hand on the back and Will gently push forward when they want the dancer to their follower to go forward and will gently release back a teensy tiny tiny bit So that this dancer is really clear what the leader is asking them to do Just these fingertips on here is not going to be a strong enough cue to really make this follower feel Comfortable that they know what the leader is asking them to do once again gazing at the floor and one is gazing up This dancer really needs work on the posture again And if they're gonna gaze at the floor, I recommend one they have a straight spine and two they both do it Okay, so in this moment, this dancer did a good job leading by offering the hand to the follower and the follower took it. So that was a good choice and a good execution of leading and following correctly. They are mirroring each other with their feet finally, so they've recovered from their kind of mix-up that's happened over the last 32 counts or more. So here the leader is attempting to do this turn and I think the follower does understand what's meant to be happening because he's not really moving very much here so I think he can tell that what's supposed to be going on here but this dancer is doing this in a very weak way. Really poor posture here through the upper spine. He's looking up but it's creating this kink in his cervical spine because the thoracic spine is so curved forward. Both shoulder positions are super super weak because they're stretched out in the front and so but not because he's engaging through here it's just because he's weak through these muscles and so it's really hard for the follower to follow and it's making the follower sort of have to be the leader here because he's so weak. Once again, they're doing very different steps from each other. He's doing these half-time steps. He's doing more double-time steps. They're both quite weak through the arms here, but especially this dancer gazing towards the floor here, really poor posture, not connected with each other at all. I mean, they are connected with each other to some degree, but not enough. A little bit better weight shift here. So this dancer is shifting the weight back again. And this dancer is more back, but he is on his way forward again, which I can see in the shape here with his torso and his weight moving forward onto that leg. So a little bit better with the weight shift there, but not fully there yet. So it's really obvious that they've switched leaders here for some reason, which is not typical at all in this type of dance. It's very obvious that he's now leading because he's bringing his arm out. It's very strong, and he's the one that's initiating the movement. Great. So this, the leader here is moving the follower into a turn. And I can, I just want to point out that this hand is not even on the dancer's back anymore. So the leader is leading the turn from this arm only. I will, that is not good technique. Good technique as a leader is, at this point, I would expect this hand to be still fully on the lower back. And he'd be using it to push the back forward while he's asking his dancer to turn. So this leader really needs to work on being very clear about his directions. So here they both did one, two, three, one, two, three with their feet, which was coordinated with each other but they're totally off from the music. That didn't really fit with the music. And I mean, even if it did, even if the one, two, three, one, two, three fit, could fit with the music they did not fit it with the music. So there's no relationship to the music in this moment. And that's really unfortunate because swing is really all about the music. It's kind of derives from some African dance forms. It's related to tap dance and tap dance is very much its own musical instrument. And so their relationship to the music and the foundational swing step is totally missing. And that's a reflection of really poor technique. It appears that they're just, okay, I know that I'm supposed to do this choreography but they're not in relationship to the music. And that relationship to the music is actually the most important thing about this style of dance and about most styles of dance. And also their relationship to the foundational step is like the second most important thing. And they don't have that relationship. They do have that relationship to some degree but they're really not cultivating it. I do think the weight shift here is pretty good. I can tell that they're both kind of putting their weight into their back outside foot and keeping their arms really strong. So that's one key point towards the better positive for them. I also like that they're both looking towards each other and keeping their gaze upwards. This dancer really needs to work on strengthening his back though because what's happening here is he's got poor posture through here. And that's partly why he keeps looking at the floor because when there's poor posture through the thoracic spine it's natural for the cervical spine to wanna go forward too especially because the head is heavy. But when he knows that he has to keep his gaze upwards what then happens is then he has to crook this way through his cervical spine and it looks really weak. It's also contributing to a weakness through his leadership in this dance because he's breaking his shoulder joint here because he's got such a kyphotic curve through the thoracic spine. And when we break our shoulder it prevents us from having a strong leadership. But even if we're a follower when the shoulder joint is smoothed out and broken in this way, when I say broken, what I mean is that it's not coming straight out from the spine because there's no strength through the rhomboids holding it there. So it just rotates forward, rotates forward. It flexes forward. So that prevents him from being a strong leader. And if you were a follower, it'd be really hard for the leader to tell him where to go because only the arm would move because there's a break in this connection here. So this dancer doesn't have that problem at least in this moment. He's very strong through the upper spine and the rhomboids which is holding the shoulder really well. So I have a feeling that a lot of the problems that are happening here are more to do with this person not leading very well and also this person not used to being a follower. Once again, not coordinated. This dancer appears to be lagging behind. So this dancer has kicked the left leg forward. And this dancer is about to kick the left leg forward. But that actually doesn't make sense because in a partner dance, typically you're mirroring each other. So again, either they're forgetting the choreography or they're not leading and following correctly. So here this dancer has kicked the outer leg forward and this one has instead stepped on the outer leg. So again they're not coordinated with each other. So I know that this person is meant to be the leader because before they started dancing he said I'm gonna be the leader. They asked each other and he said I'm gonna lead. So this leader, either the leader is not doing a good job of leading, the follower is trying to lead, or they were supposed to do this very, or there's a choreography where they were both know that they're supposed to do a kick here but maybe he forgot. Either way it's whatever the cause it's not coordinated. I mean as partner dancing, as partner dancers they should be doing the same thing as each other or facilitating each other doing something different from each other. So here they are finally coordinating their steps. So they're doing a kind of basic swing step, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, three, one, two. And they're doing a good job of doing the same step backwards and forwards as each other. You can kind of see that in this moment that their inner foot is, their weight is on their inner foot and their outer foot is stepping back. They're not fully together though, still. So you can tell that because this dancer's foot is fully off the ground, whereas this dancer is moving towards putting his foot on the ground. Another thing is that they're facing in a strange way. Like this dancer seems to be facing more towards his partner than this one. And once again, you know, gazing towards the floor is not helping them. You know, a confident posture and a gaze forward or gazing at each other would help a lot. So somehow they got opposite of each other here, meaning one of them is doing like the first half of the swing step and the other one's doing the second half. So this dancer is doing one two three and this one is on the one two and that also has to do with the shape of their feet. So the step should be open on the one two three and then crossing behind on the one two. So they're both technically doing this step correctly because they are going side to side on the one two three and then crossing on the one two but they're opposite of each other so one's doing the first half the other one's doing the second half and I think this again goes back to being in relationship to the music and in relationship to the foundational step at all times. If they were both doing that this wouldn't happen. This dancer is good at recovering from mistakes, or so far has done a good job of recovering from mistakes, including in this moment. So they were just doing this kick sequence. It was unclear what it was meant to look like, but they were not coordinated with each other. And this dancer was able to recover. Actually, that's not true. I was gonna say he was able to recover because now he's doing the same foot work as the other dancer, but he really should be doing mirroring the other dancer because they are in a partner dance. I get the feeling that maybe they're both used to being leaders. And in this moment, this dancer is the follower, in this piece, this dancer is the follower. And I think he may be getting his feet mixed up because of that. Because typically, not typically, whenever we're doing partner dancing, we're always mirroring each other. Otherwise you would step on each other, which is why when one dancer is going backwards with the left foot, the other dancer is going forward with the right, for example. So I get the feeling that they're not, he's maybe not used to following. And so he's mixed up which foot he's supposed to be on. They did recover from their mistake, however. So just previously, this dancer kicked the right leg forward and back, whereas this dancer kicked the left leg and then the right leg forward. So I think that maybe one of them forgot the choreography, but they recovered quite well from it. Actually, this dancer recovered well from it. This dancer just kept going, but this dancer, who is meant to be the follower, did end up following correctly and recovered. And I can see that because now they're doing the same step as each other mirrored. So that's great. Again, just looking at the floor and this posture forward is not good. It's just not good. If I were a... Well, I am the audience. I'm seeing the tops of their heads. I'm not seeing their smiles. I'm not seeing their faces. Now, if in this particular moment, this is what's meant to happen, meaning looking at the floor, what I would want to see is a straight spine so that it looks intentional. And is a shape of some sort. This kind of hunched over posture with the gaze down is not a shape and does not look intentional. So here they've done a few steps forward. They are coordinated with each other, which is great, but they are not coordinated with the music. Those steps forward were not on the beat. Once again, you know, this style of dance is very much about the music, and they've totally missed that. Once again, neither of them have returned to the basic foundational step, but you know, they don't always have to do 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, which is the basic swing step. They could be doing 1, 2, 3, 4 at times. It should still always be in relationship to that foundational rhythm. But regardless, neither of them are in relationship to the music whatsoever. They're just sort of both randomly stepping on whenever they can to get to whatever they're trying to do here. So it really drops the whole purpose of the dance, which is to emphasize the music. Or, you know, at least to be on the music. And they're not on the music at all. Good job here. So they're going back and forth with this one, two, three, one, two, and they're quite well coordinated with each other. Great. I love that this dancer is trying to keep his gaze forward. This dancer is still looking at the floor, however, so I would recommend they choose one or the other and if they are going to look at the floor to have a straight spine. Once again, they're not coordinated, they're not doing the same footwork as each other. The leader is really, really weak here in this sort of strange, like, rotated position. So once again, just emphasizing the importance of coming back to the basic foundational step at all times when you're doing a social dance of this type. This dancer is doing that. So he's doing a good job. He's going underneath the other dancer's arm and he's doing the basic swing step, which is great. But this dancer is not maintaining that. And so that's going to create this imbalance of rhythm between the two dancers, which is partly why they're not well coordinated with each other. And if they could both always go back to that basic foundational step, it would go a long way towards making this whole piece look a lot more coordinated. And now they're having another confusing moment, and that's because this leader is not leading very well, very strongly. He's bringing this arm around, but the follower doesn't quite understand what's meant to happen here. And that's because the leader did not push him in the direction he wanted him to go. He's bringing this arm back behind him, pretty strong here, but it's not very obvious because of the way that this arm came around, it's not obvious to the follower what's meant to happen. So again, they're not well-coordinated here. Again, weird, weird, small little mincing step happening here through this weight shift. It's probably a small mincing step because he's shifting his weight back at the same time that the leader is shifting forward. Once again, they are not coordinated with each other whatsoever. What needs to happen is they both need to be shifting back at the same time. They're not even doing the same step as each other here. So once again, really poorly coordinated between each other. So once again, not coordinated here with each other. This dancer also is not even stepping on the beat at all, and they're totally out of sync with each other. And again, comes back to doing the foundational step and coming back to that foundational step at all times. One thing I want to point out too, is that this is like the fourth repetition of this side to side step where they have not been coordinated with each other. So it's taking them a really long time to recover from their mistakes. Maybe they don't even know they've made a mistake or can't really tell they're not well coordinated. And that's a big problem. Anytime you're doing a performance, you need to catch your mistake really, really quickly, and you need to correct it really, really quickly. They're taking way too long to recognize and correct their mistakes. Again, not well coordinated. So this dancer has kicked the right leg forward and now is currently kicking it back, whereas this dancer kicked the left leg forward and then the right leg forward. So they're not coordinated here again. So either they're forgetting their choreography or they're just not leading and following correctly. So good. So here they're quite coordinated with each other. They're traveling on this diagonal and they're sort of alternating these steps with this sort of rocking motion. And they're doing it opposite foot of each other. They're staying connected on their hands. Looks really good in terms of the footwork. But once again, poor posture and gazing towards the floor. This really very much detracts from any success they're having down here with their lower half of their body. It looks weak. It looks like they lack confidence. There's not a whole lot of interest for the viewer. So, you know, any success they have here, they've totally lost it up here. I really recommend, especially this dancer, strengthen through that spine, keep the gaze forward and confident. This was much better. So this is the second time they've repeated this 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 with a turn. Much better, more well coordinated. They seem to be on the same page here. This is the ultimate example of how they're not coordinated, or I shouldn't say it that way. This is the ultimate example so far that shows that they're not well-coordinated. They literally bumped into each other here. So they're out of sync with each other. They're not doing the same step as each other. This dancer's not leading very well. This dancer's not following very well. You can tell he knows they messed up here, that they're bumping into each other, and it's for all those reasons I just listed. So here this dancer is looking side to side really quickly and it seems as if that's because he doesn't know what he's meant to be doing. They're just not coordinated with each other once again. So they've kind of started dancing here. The music has just started and they've kind of started dancing, but it's really unclear whether they've actually started or not, because it kind of looks like they're marking their steps. So I just would encourage them to be really clear that they are starting and actually just launch into it and use exaggerated big movement. They're both looking towards the floor, which is not professional. It's not a good performance choice, typically, especially for this style of dance. I mean, in like a postmodern or abstracted style of dance, okay, maybe in certain cases, but this is not the type of dance where looking at the floor is a good idea. I don't know if they're looking at the floor because they're uncomfortable with their steps, or it sort of looks to me like at least this dancer might be in this poor posture because he thinks it like makes him, because he thinks it looks cool. And I can tell because in the moments before the music started, they were both kind of just warming up a little bit. And he was looking at the floor, even in that case, and kind of swinging his arms in a way that's like, this makes me look like I'm confident and I know what I'm doing and I'm cool. But like, no, it doesn't. So I would just recommend that they look up. Once again, they've both lost the foundational step here. Neither of them are doing one, two, three, one, two. This dancer appears to be trying to do a one, two little step here, but this dancer isn't really taking that cue. And maybe that's partly because he's supposed to be the leader. So again, really poorly coordinated here. It seems like neither of them really know what they're supposed to be doing here. But even if they don't know what they're supposed to be doing, they're not recovering well. Again, they're not doing the same step as each other. So this dancer has just done a basic swing step one and two. Well, the first half of a basic swing step, one, two, three. And this dancer did one, two. And he's on the wrong foot at this point. So that's because this dancer did three steps and this one only did two. And so he's ending up on the wrong foot. And I know he's on the wrong foot because in a partner dance, they should be mirroring each other. So in this moment, this dancer should have the weight on the right leg and the left leg in the air, but he's doing the opposite. And that's partly because he did the wrong step. Because it should be one, two, three. One, two, three. Well, this dancer did one, two, three. And so this one should be doing one, two, three. Instead he did one, two. And again, I think that maybe he's used to following. And so I think he, excuse me, used to leading. And so by this point in leading, he would be on the left foot. So he might just be, his mind might just be putting him on the wrong foot because he thinks, oh, I'm supposed to be on that foot. So he might just need more practice following over time. And you know, another thing about partner dancing in these types of ways. So swing is a very particular type of social partner dancing. And pretty much all social partner dancing that is formalized such as swing, you're basically doing the basic step the whole time. But then you're doing variations on that. But you should always be able to come back to the basic step, especially if you are getting off from your, if you're getting, if your coordination is not perfect with your partner, always best just to come back to the basic step because you both know that that's your foundation. And neither of them are really doing that. I can tell that they've like learned this choreography. And so they're just trying to do the choreography rather than, okay, everything comes back to the basic step, whether it is the basic step or a variation on the basic step, or just being on the rhythm of the basic step. And I don't think either of them are doing that. Otherwise they would be much more well coordinated. And the leader would be even more strongly able to lead the follower. Yeah, so he's now leading for some reason. That's a really inexplicable choice. He kind of was sort of back leading the whole time, but now he's just obviously leading. So he just turned this dancer who's now the follower, but this dancer did not do that turn very well. He's like flailing, literally flailing here to recover from that turn. And I think it has to do again with a weak frame through the shoulders so that this dancer is really strong. And so he quickly turned the other dancer's arm, but because his frame was so weak, it's really thrown him off balance. And also why is this person leading now? That doesn't make any sense. Again, not well coordinated here, so this dancer has stepped across his body and is moving to the right, whereas this dancer is sort of just staying in place. I think he's not taking the leader's lead very well here, and that's partly why they're not coordinated. So good, now they're coordinated here. So they're both doing a kick with the inner leg, the leg that is closer to each other. I might suggest doing something interesting with the arms. You can see they're not coordinated with each other. This dancer has a bent elbow and this one has a sort of relaxed arm. So, you know, this kick could be really nice if it was accentuated by some sort of arm movement, maybe straight out from the body or in a V shape or something. It's just the arms are just not helping emphasize the movement, which is fine if they were just partner dancing for fun, you know, at a party or club or something. But this is supposed to be a performance. So I might just say let's add a little bit of interest with some arm movements here too. Once again, really poorly coordinated. So this leader has, was on, his weight was on his left leg and has now transferred it to the right. But that is not coordinated with this dancer shifting his weight back onto the right. So either this dancer shifted back too early or this one is shifting back too late. In order to make this successful, they both need to shift their weight backwards at the same time, because then that creates a counterbalance. This dancer is in a really great dynamic shape for that, but it's not, he's not able to fully reach his potential here because this dancer is also shifting forward. So what's happening is they're both shifting in this direction, but you know, what was meant to happen was shifting in the opposite direction of each other to create a nice counterbalance. Again, this kind of curve through this upper spine and shoulder is making him, this leader, be in quite a weak position. So that's preventing the follower from making a really nice big shape. He's doing, this follower is doing a great job with this plie and this push back through the pelvis. He's just not being counterbalanced well by his leader. Again, no relationship to the music, no relationship to each other in terms of the footwork. Better weight transfer here. So they're both shifting their weight backwards, which is creating a nice counterbalance. This dancer has reached that in a little bit too quick, sharp, and heavy, not heavy, but strong of a way relative to this dancer. So just I would recommend they work on their dynamics a little bit. If it is going to be a sharp movement back, then this dancer needs to do that too to really improve this counterbalance. This dancer really needs to work on keeping this shoulder really, really strong, this frame. You know, in social dancing, we think about the frame of this part of the body, and he's not holding that at all here. So that might be why this dancer is having to work extra hard to bring this back onto his own weight because he's not getting a great counterbalance and strength through this dancer's frame. Again, gazing towards the floor here, it just conveys a lack of confidence and a lack of sureness in what they're doing. They are coordinated with their step here, which is good. They're doing the same step as each other. They've done a good job with these last eight or so counts of staying coordinated with each other. They're both doing a one, two, three, one, two, three, and they're both doing it on the same beat. They're going opposite of each other, mirroring each other, which is really great. You can see in this moment that they both have their weight on their inside leg, and then they're coming back on the ball of the outside leg. So good job staying well coordinated here. I think part of why that's successful is because they're looking at each other, and so they're able to actually make eye contact and coordinate in that way. Yeah, if somebody doesn't know who's the leader, if the partners don't know who's leading and who's following, that's going to just again compound the fact that they're not coordinated with each other or with the music. You can see that they're just doing different steps here now. They're just really poorly coordinated with each other. I don't know if it's because the leader is not giving good signals here or whether the follower is not taking the signals very well and is maybe trying to lead, but they're not even doing the same step as each other here. You can tell that because their feet are in totally different positions. So the leader is facing towards the follower with this leg and this one is sort of off the floor in this direction. I guess this one is towards the leader, so maybe this inner leg is well coordinated, but this dancer's got his opposite foot behind him. So they're just really poorly coordinated with each other. Again, hard to tell in this moment whether it's because the leader is not leading well or the follower is trying to lead, but either way, they're poorly, poorly coordinated with each other. In this moment, what I would expect to see if they were coordinated would be that their feet would be mirroring each other in a partner dance. Simple posture here for this dancer, kind of arching through here and then this way with the cervical spine. I would just really encourage him to work on having a nice straight back. So now this dancer is coming through here and because he went really quickly back with his weight shift, he's rebounding way too quickly back into this dancer and they actually almost hit each other again.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

He's really trying to offer that to her here, and he's doing a good job with his strength through his arm as he shifts his weight back. And she's, I think, maybe a little nervous or scared about getting herself off balance, even though he would be there to hold her. So that'd be something that these two can work on is, number one, trust, and then number two, what does it feel like when they're both holding tension and their weight is going away from each other? That would create a lot more dynamism to the movement and also actually give her more strength through that tension to move wherever he wants her to go next so that she doesn't have to do it on her own. It would be the momentum created by that tension and that weight counterbalance that would help move her in the direction he wants her to go. So here they're just doing this kind of side to side step. He's got his hands on her mid back or lower back here and she's chosen to lift her arms up in the air and then bring them down onto his shoulders. Again, very pedestrian looking. It reminds me of watching some people at a school dance or something kind of swaying side to side and the one person just kind of casually lifting their arm. So it again, looks quite amateurish. So I would say either don't do that with the arms at all or make it even more intentional by maybe straightening the elbows, energy out the fingertips and then making a really intentional looking arc around to the shoulders would give it more of a performance quality rather than just a rehearsing or casual quality. This is a nice moment. They've turned away from each other. They've let go of their hands. This is a really good example of a great way to use the arms. They're both really well extended through the arms all the way from the shoulders out to, well I'll talk about her fingertips in a moment, but let's look at this side. The shoulders, the elbow, the wrist really well aligned. Lots of energy out through the fingertips. Same thing for him. Everything's aligned. There's a lot of energy coming out the fingertips. Her weight shift looks really good. She's quite strong on this plie. Nice extension through this leg. I love that they're both looking towards each other. It's really, really nice. Normally I would want to see this as a straight wrist, but she did a really nice little flick of the wrist downward that looked super intentional and actually added to the line. So I think that this is a really good example of how to use the center of the body, energy coming out the limbs for the intention that you're trying to make. So what I'd encourage them to do is replicate this feeling in their improvisation. So they kind of lost each other, right? So he pulled her in and she turned her body. So she was facing this direction and he was facing this direction, which was clearly not meant to happen. She was meant to face him. And then they had this awkward moment of kind of stepping in place, which was not a great recovery from that. But she did this nice little improvisation moment where she was like, let's try to make it look, well, I don't know what she was thinking exactly, but it seems to me as if she may have been thinking, let's try to make this look intentional. So I'm gonna do this little back arch thing. So I think that was an interesting choice. She's got a great arch through her back. She's a very flexible person, which is one reason, again, she needs to work on her core strength, because if you're naturally a flexible person, you need to get really strong through your muscles or you can get injured. Anyway, point is she tried to recover here. However, the problem with that is that she's not the leader. And so the leader has already moved on to something else because that's his job is to tell her where to go or communicate with her where to go. And she went off and went rogue. And so they're now, again, even though this was an attempt to recover, they're even more disconnected than they were before she tried that. I think here I'm glad that she's again using her whole body. She's got her arms straight up in the air, but again, looks really, really pedestrian and amateurish. We can really see this hyper lordosis through her lumbar spine, and that's because she's not engaged through her core, which is part of the reason it looks pedestrian. Great job with this leader really offering. This is such a great freeze frame here, because you can see him just, boop, he's offering his hand there to say, okay, let's connect now. And I think he's doing a good job of that. Again, though, I really would want to see him using more of his body, a little bit more energy out this hand. Again, lack of core strength with this dancer is meaning that her movements are all coming from the joints of her body and in this moment, and also preventing her from isolating the joint or the part of her body that I think she's trying to isolate. I don't think she has a lot of experience in isolation, which is something that you can learn from something like a jazz class. Isolation means really being able to just move one body part at a time. And typically, we work on moving just the cervical spine, the shoulders, the thorax, and the pelvis at different times. So I think what she's trying to do here is isolate her thorax with her arms in the air. But it's obvious she doesn't have a lot of experience doing that and doesn't have enough core strength to really pull that off. And so again, it's looking very, very pedestrian, like someone who doesn't have a lot of experience. And there's nothing wrong with her not having experience. She just needs more experience and more technique class, more strength through her core. But it doesn't make me want to watch her as a viewer. It actually makes me feel kind of uncomfortable as a viewer because, again, looks like someone who's a beginner trying to pull something off that she's not quite ready to pull off yet. Again, though, I will give her that she's trying to move her whole body and she is moving her whole body. Whereas this dancer, he's moving his arms a little bit here, but he's just lacking energy. He's really not pulling any energy out through his body unlike her. So she's at least putting energy into it, whereas he's not. So they're really not very well matched in this case. Here, this dancer is now moving the hips side to side. Again, lack of core strength is a problem for her because as she's moving her hips side to side, because she doesn't have a lot of core strength, she has to, she doesn't have to, but what happens because of lack of core strength is that this whole area moves as a unit. And so it looks very stiff rather than this smaller area being able to move as a unit, which would look nice and loose as an isolation. She probably hasn't had a lot of practice isolating her hips, and so she's moving a bigger chunk of her torso at a time, which makes it look very stiff. She's in this very, very wide stance, which is also a super awkward and very weak position. You can see that her knees are actually collapsing inward, and she's pronating through her feet, which is not good form at all. She's, it's very hard to move from this place because there's really no strength in it at all. And that's another reason she can't be nice and loose through her hips. You can get, if she had her foot right underneath her hip, meaning like right in line with her hip, if her hip, knee, and ankle were in line with each other and she did a nice plie and strengthened her core a bit, she could really move those hips in the way that I think she's intending to move them here. She's doing this little running step again. It just doesn't fit with the style. It doesn't fit with the music. Not much coordination or strength through the core. It looks really kind of floppy. He is trying to use his arms here again so that's good. I'll give him that. I'd like to see more plie so he can move his body more. I'd like to see more energy out the fingertips. So here the leader did a good job of bringing his weight back and keeping this arm strong to create a weight counterbalance, but she didn't really follow his lead super well. I would like to see her let herself let her weight go a little bit. She's kind of keeping her weight really centered, which usually is a good thing, but there are certain cases like in this moment where it would have been nice if she would have allowed her weight to be back on this foot while the weight his weight was back on this one a little bit more. That would have created more tension between the arms here so that when he pulls back toward himself he would really be pulling her rather than her having to put a lot of effort into moving in that direction. Here they're really not connected with each other. I think he's attempting to look in her direction, but they've kind of lost any connection they had initially when they started this improv section. And so any kind of sexual tension that they were trying to portray is kind of dropped here. And even if they weren't trying to portray that, the connection between them is dropped. So that was actually helping a little bit, and now they've lost that aspect of it. She collapsed inwards here with these arms coming in. That's going to be really hard for them to reconnect. It is really hard for them to reconnect. They almost smack into each other here because she brought her arms so close into her body rather than having a frame that he could latch onto. And you can see he's trying to latch onto her here, and he's about to, he's kind of pushing her away from him because he's, they're going to hit each other if he doesn't. So, so as she comes in toward him, she needs to set up a frame so that it's easier for them to connect, a nice strong frame with her arms. That's a good little section. They're doing this forward touch, back touch little section with this open position, which is nice. But again, here in this moment, she's starting to lead again. And you can tell that because they're not on the same, well, they're on the same foot, but they should be mirrored. So if this were what was meant to happen, he would also have this foot behind him in this moment. But she's chosen to take the lead here for a second or longer, potentially we'll see, which is not a good idea because we can't confuse who's leading and who's following because you will get uncoordinated from each other. So here she's not taking his lead very well. It's like she, it looks like she wants to keep holding this position out, but he's trying to pull her in. And she's kind of forcing him to lead her, to follow her here, which is, it can be very confusing. And I know there's, we could certainly critique partner dancing for the follower, leader, man, woman types of roles that are required or that are typically asked of people. But in this case, she is the follower. And so if you're choosing to be the follower, you need to let the leader lead, because it gets really confusing. And then you often will get uncoordinated from each other, because it's unclear what's meant to be happening. Really, again, weakness here through the neck. As she's coming backwards, she's really extending her cervical spine. It just looks, again, quite weak and quite pedestrian. So this dancer especially is struggling with this improv section. It really looks like he doesn't know what to do with his arms and again it it comes across as awkward. So here again, they're doing this side to side movement. This dancer really lacks coordination and control between the various parts of her body. And I think that's again, cause her movement is not coming from her core. And so right here as they're going back and forth in this movement, she's moving her hips, she's moving her shoulders, she's moving her head and they're kind of all going in different directions as each other. And so again, is giving this sort of pedestrian casual quality to it. It looks very unprofessional. She doesn't really have any frame here held with him and he's trying to hold his frame, but I think he's having trouble cause she's so, so close to him. And so, you know, she just really needs to work on strength and coordination between her limbs. Although he looks like he's having fun, so that's great. So this beginning section, the dancers are very obviously improvising. They are both dancing, but they're not partnering yet. They're just dancing individually at the same time as each other. It's clear that they're attempting to convey a sense of like sexiness or sexual tension, partly because that's what the music is sort of conveying with the rhythm, with the instrumentation, the saxophone being the main instrument, and also with some of the movements, especially this dancer's movements. So that's good. At least they're being intentional about what they're trying to say with this piece. My biggest critique though is that they're obviously not very experienced dancers who are now improvising. And it's never a good idea for a beginning dancer to attempt to improvise, because it's very obvious to the viewer that they're not experienced dancers. And so it's not very interesting to watch. In fact, it's a little tiny bit like uncomfortable to watch, because it's like you're watching just any person move their body, rather than a professional or someone with excellent technique move their body. And so, but it's in a performative way. So it's kind of uncomfortable for the viewer to witness. Couple of things in particular that make this look like inadequate technique. One is that they're both looking towards the floor. That's a clear sign of a beginning dancer or someone with little confidence in what they're doing. Another thing are these, this tension through this dancer's wrists. It's much easier to see in this camera angle here. So you can see that the wrists are flexed inward. There's some tension through the ends of the fingers here. Lots of tension through the whole hand here as well. And that's a sign that this person is either not fully aware of what's going on with their arms or is a bit uncomfortable with what they're doing, not super confident in what they're doing. And so they're holding tension somewhere. And for this person, it's here in the wrists, even a little bit through the bicep here as well. When there's not a good extension from the arms, that's a pretty telltale sign that someone is a rather beginning dancer. This dancer is taking really big steps here. It looks like what she's trying to do is make a jazz square. Jazz square is when you step with one foot, cross the other foot over, bring the next foot back, and then the next foot over. So what it ends up making is a square shape on the floor. It appears that's what she's trying to do. Her steps are just way too big. And so what's happening is it looks really clunky, awkward, and stiff because her steps are so big. Part of the reason that the big steps are making it look clunky is that when you take a big step like that, you have to have a straight knee as you step across. It would be really hard for her to take such a big step and land on a plie. And when we land on a straight leg, that's always going to create a reverberation upward, which makes it look stiff because it is stiff. Another thing is that she's not on the ball of her foot here. And so that flat foot is also going to give a sense of heaviness and clunkiness. So those are a couple of things in this moment. But in general, this improv section is pretty hard to watch as a viewer because they're clearly not very experienced dancers. And so it's very awkward looking. It makes the viewer feel awkward. So they're not on the beat anymore here. It's taking a long time for them to recover from the previous moment when he brought her back in and she thought he was going to turn her, but he wasn't. They still haven't quite recovered from that moment, and so it's led to them here not being on the beat anymore with the music. Here they've come from this counterbalance position and now they've come in towards each other and you can see that they missed each other here. So I think what was meant to happen was that she was supposed to be facing him in this moment. So I think that he didn't lead her exactly where he wanted her to go. I think she probably thought that what he wanted her to do was a turn. So just really being clear with your follower about exactly where you want them to go would go a long way for this dancer to be more successful. Again with the improv same critiques as before there's not much arc to it not much phrasing to it It looks quite pedestrian not a lot of energy through the whole body at least for this dancer He's doing a better job this time trying to incorporate his arms But still we I'd like to see more energy coming all the way out the fingertips more core strength here more coordination of the limbs So here again we can see because of her lack of core strength she's actually fallen and caught herself on this leg and that's because she doesn't have enough core strength to hold the previous position that she was in where she was facing this way. Now they're back in another improv section. Again, it's not effective. It really looks too casual, too pedestrian. You know, a lack of shapes with the arms, a lack of an arc. They're not really telling much of a story. There's really not much phrasing in what they're doing here. So again, I would recommend don't improvise until you have more experience improvising and more experience as a dancer, or improvise but keep it really, really, really simple. Thank you. Just another general critique of this section, this improv section here. Good improv will have some sort of an arc to it. It doesn't have to be a story or a narrative or anything like that, but it has to has to convey something and bring the audience on this sort of a journey and that could just be imitating the phrasing of the music. Simple as that. They're both on the tempo of the music, but they're not really in relationship to the phrasing of the music and they're not creating any kind of arc with their movement. They're just sort of randomly doing different moves that they think of in the moment and even though that's what improv sounds like it is, that's not actually what improv is. Improv is crafting a story or crafting a it's not necessarily a story, crafting a phrase in the moment. Crafting a choreographic phrase in the moment and they're not doing that and so it just looks like again random people just randomly dancing. It does not look like a performance. So I would recommend they do not improv until they're more advanced dancers and have more experience maybe even taking classes in improvisation before they try to improv on stage or don't do improv at all in this choreography. Just do choreography that is set. So, good job here of replicating the previous moment on the music. So, the music has this sort of ba-dap horn moment. And before, they were facing this way, and they did this, pretty much the same moment with the previous time that the horns did that. And now, they're doing it again. So, I think that was a really, really good choice musically. Again, I didn't catch him in the highest moment of his arm, but both of them did a really good job with extension through the arms again, plie to the side, nice weight shift. I actually like his leg here better. It has a sort of jazzy feel than the previous time he had it flexed. So, it's a nice jazzy feel that they're both doing here. They're still gazing towards each other. Really, really nice choice. So again, this is a really awkward section here. She's still trying this jazz square. And now I'm realizing as I'm watching that I think he's also trying to do a jazz square. He's just not doing it in a very pronounced way. One thing I will give this dancer is at least she's trying to dance with her whole body. Compared to him, he's really not doing that. He's mainly just moving his legs. His arms are very pedestrian. This frame almost looks as if I just took a picture of somebody walking normally. So he's not using his whole body. At least she's using her whole body. He's really just focusing on the feet. And he's doing it in a very slow, not slow, small way. And so it's again coming across as very pedestrian. She's doing this way too big with her feet. Compared to him, her footwork is way too big. It's making it very, very awkward. One big critique for this dancer is she lacks core strength. And I can tell that because as she stepped around here, she wasn't able to keep herself upright. She actually collapsed down, which is what we're seeing in this moment here. It again looks really, really awkward. It looks really, really stiff. Another thing is that the reason I, not the reason, I'm pointing out this lack of core strength because what it's leading to is the way that she moves all her limbs is not emanating from her core. It's emanating from the joints of the body. And so it's making it look very haphazard. It makes her movements look sort of vague and unintentional. Again, makes it look very pedestrian because she's lacking a foundational aspect of a good dance technique, which is core strength.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Right here she's circling her arms and she's circling her ribcage counterclockwise over and over again, but these circles can be grander. They can be taking up or have a greater circumference and each of her movements have radiating eccentricities. The dancer is executing all of the steps correctly. Like her footwork is very clear. She is definitely in control of her body, which is so wonderful. The dancer also is able to extend her right arm out while keeping her right shoulder pressed down. So her neck is still elongated here. So that's great execution. The dancer is beginning to glance over to the side of the room towards the mirror, perhaps because she's entering the end of the dance. But even if the dance is soon to be ending, it's even more important that she finishes strongly. So she needs to remain concentrated throughout the entirety of the routine, the end included, so she should be looking straightforward. The dancer just needs to be careful in this position with her balance. Her sternum is pulling backwards a little bit. Her hips are leaned a bit forward. So she just needs to make sure she's aligned. Her spine should be vertical. She shouldn't be leaning further back in her upper body than her lower body. One way in which she couldn't loosen her body here is using her hips and her shoulders Her arms are in a correct position. Her feet are alternating moving Forward her right foot in her left. Her arms are well coordinated Opposite arm is moving forward than her legs. So that's great when she's moving her right arm forward She's moving her left leg forward and vice versa, but She also now needs to use additional body parts namely her shoulders and her hips here The dancer begins to look down here. She should be looking straight ahead. Even though this is the very end of the routine, she shouldn't be losing her focus. She needs to improve her focus here and remain looking straight forward. However, the dancer now needs to loosen up a bit. Every movement that she's doing is so exact and it's technically correct, but she can use more artistry in her movement, just a sense of letting go and looseness. The dancer is doing a great job of being on her toes. She's turning with her heels lifted off the ground. So that's allowing her to complete these turns more swiftly. This is very good right here. The dancer is extending her right arm completely while she leans her upper body away from that arm and her leg is also, her right leg is also in a straight line. So this is really good execution and while she keeps her right arm out and her right leg fully straight, she's bending her left leg purposely so that she could be traveling which is very good.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And one thing that we can see is that they are actually starting to reach around the good side of the hold so they can utilize it. And then one thing we can also see is that this is kind of a very full span move that the climber is having to experience and do. But one thing I can definitely notice about their position here is that because they're hanging on with a right hand, they are forced to use a left foot on this yellow hold here. And then this kind of allows them to use opposite points of contact with the wall so they do get really good control of what's going on with their body. But one thing that I am noticing as they're doing this movement, we can kind of see that they're really hanging back and over to the right, which kind of shows to me that they have a preference of pulling in with their upper body, which isn't always a bad thing. But in this case, it seems like it's pulling them away from their movement because their body is still hanging over to the right. So what I would encourage this climber is to really make sure that they focus on transitioning their body weight over to that left foot. And one thing that we can see is that with their left knee, it's kind of pointed into the wall right now. And by allowing their knee to be pointed into the wall, this further pulls their body away from the wall and over to the right. So then that way, again, they're kind of working against themselves. So what I would encourage the climbers instead of placing their left knee facing towards the wall is by allowing it to be parallel to the wall so that their hip is open. And by doing this, this helps to guide their knee along the length of the wall, which further allows them to stay on that left foot. Because as we can see that as they're committing to this move, that left foot actually did slide off of that foothold there, which is again making it very hard for them to complete this movement altogether. So by allowing their knee to be open and their hip open to the wall, they can further transition their body weight over to that left knee and over that left foot, which will help them overall in their movement.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He has trouble switching from this kind of upbeat into this slower beat here. More rehearsal of the choreography as well as a deeper embodiment of the rhythm would be beneficial. As a dancer performs these series of triple or shuffle steps in between his movements, he demonstrates that he's able to deeply embody the rhythm and stay on rhythm as well as stay on tempo as he's transitioning in and out of steps. He has a clear understanding of how to transition from one step to another. However, he would benefit from some clarity in his arm choreography as well as in his upper body in general. As the dancer gets further in this performance, he starts to lose his stamina here a little bit. His small steps, which before were able to really closely maintain the rhythm, start to fall off rhythm slightly, and he disengages his arms and doesn't do much with them choreographically. He also falls behind the rhythm quite significantly as he's performing this step, and not performing the triple step fully. As the dancer starts with a series of small kicks and some quick footwork, he shows that he has an understanding of the movement vocabulary here, however he could use a little bit of refining, particularly in the working leg here. He would benefit from engaging his upper leg muscles in his pelvis more to stabilize his kick so it doesn't come out in this flicking motion and has more control. He would also benefit from stabilizing his pelvis here as well as engaging his spine and his arms. As the dancer switches back to the same kicks that he was performing in the beginning of this performance, he again could benefit from some clarity throughout his body, particularly in the leg that's kicking, as well as some stability in his pelvis and down through his spine. More stability here, particularly in his pelvis, would help him to control his movement quality and control his movement dynamics, as well as stay more connected to the rhythm. As the dancer continues through this performance, it becomes clear that he's demonstrating the step as if he were partnering with someone else. You can see this here in his left arm outreached where there would be a partner over here on the other side. So he's primarily performing one step of the partner movement sequence, or one side of it, which shows he has a strong understanding of the movement technique and the movement vocabulary itself. As a dancer performs a series of turns around himself, he has a lot of stability in his turn and he's able to move quickly and efficiently. Primarily because of this bend in his knees and this dropping back of his pelvis, he's got a low center of gravity which helps him to turn quickly and efficiently. Here he would benefit from some added choreography of the arms as well as a straightening up of the posture through the top of the head, through particularly the upper spine. Perhaps spotting his head might be helpful here, though not super necessary for this movement vocabulary.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Those are two of the natural tendencies of the high strings on a guitar. He's controlling it very well by using a very sensitive and lighter touch with his finger A up on that high string. So that's well done. It was a really nice crescendo to get to this more dramatic part of the piece. So it's a great musical decision. Lutars is doing a very nice job of bringing out the moving bass notes with finger P in the right hand. On the highest note of the scale, the top note, we heard a little bit of a twang to that sound. That just is because the string has become so shortened at that point, and we're so high up on the neck that it's a lot more sensitive, and so the guitarist just has to make sure that it isn't too aggressive of a movement up there, that it's a nice, firm but gentle pluck, because every movement that high in the string is going to be exaggerated in terms of what we hear. We just had one little moment there of left hand and right hand out of sync. We just need to make sure the left hand is a hair faster than the right hand so that left hand finger is already there by the time we pluck the string. We like to hear a little bit more of the middle voices here. We're losing a little bit of this chord's harmonic identity. And this is ascending scale, and each of the three note figures that are descending, we hear a bit of an accent. Ideally we would want all of these notes to sound the same. It's kind of a mental thing that he is doing here, to just place where he is in the scale, but we need to make sure that none of these notes are popping out, that it's just very even. We heard a little bit of a slide between the penultimate note of the scale and the ultimate note of the scale. And this is because the guitarist did not plan out a fingering where he would be able to use adjacent fingers. Instead, he had to use a fingering of 4, 4, 4 for three notes in a row. And that just makes it really difficult to both sustain the sound while also playing clean between the notes. So because he had to slide 4 to 4, we heard that slide. Whereas if he used a fingering that was perhaps maybe in this scenario 1, 2, 1, we wouldn't have had that slide and we could have better sustain in the notes. So it's just a matter of planning out the fingering better. It's a really great left hand shape. We can see a nice curve to all the fingers. The string is being played with the fingertip on all four stringers and we see that the thumb is in the middle of the back of the hand. So it's exactly what we want to see. We're hearing a little bit of distortion of pitch, a little bit of these middle voices being out of tune. That's because the guitarist is allowing the pressure of pushing down the strings to slide the strings up toward the low E string. So we want to make sure that even in a difficult hand frame like this, we're still making sure that our fingers are coming directly down on top of the string and not letting the string bend side to side. The guitarist is doing a great job of stretching his fingers, which is necessary here, without distorting the hand shape. So we now see that there's a two fret distance between fingers one and two, but that hasn't changed anything else about his hand. He made the necessary adjustment of bringing his wrist out further so that he could reach this better, and he's kept his fingers perpendicular to the strings in a relaxed hand, so that's excellent. That was an excellent shift. It was very smooth. We noticed the shape of the hand did not distort at all on the shift. Because the thumb is nice and loose and not clamping on the neck, he was able to just gently move his hand to the new location without any kind of a jerking movement. So excellent shift. That's a 10 out of 10 scale. Every note was clear, every note was consistent in terms of note envelope, in terms of dynamics. That was exactly how you should play a scale. There's a slight crescendo to the top of the scale and a slight decrescendo to the bottom. That's well done.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

This is important because the climber eventually will have to transfer over the load when making the flag and to sustain that foot placement, it's important that the climber has control in continuing to apply pressure on that move. As the climber had pushed with the left toe, it had actually come out of contact. So she sends the left leg to be extended and is folding behind the right foot placement. This is called back flagging and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place as well as keeping balance and stability when performing the move. As she is trying to adjust the right hand grip to send over the load, also keeping the left leg extended helps the climber to keep her left side of the body towards the wall. The climber is starting at a one-hold start where she places both of the hands on the same hold. This is called matching and she's sustaining right now to the lip of the hold by placing the fingers inside of the hold and curling them and to add extra pressure onto the grip the climber sends the thumbs onto a pinch at the hold where she creates a squiz to secure the grip. Once the climber has done this we can see how she has extended the arms and leaned back to transfer the weight to the grips and before her feet were on the mat and the climber starts until her feet are no longer in the mat are placed onto the wall. Now her left foot is placed much lower on the foot chip than the right foot where it's now placed out on distance. This the climber will push down onto the foot chips to raise the hips. The climber performing the flag, her right foot has popped off from the foot chip and now both of the feet are on the mat ending the climb. The climber has pushed on the left toe this so the climber had direction on sending the right hand up for the reach and in doing so we can see how the climber has thrown her shoulder up in order to have more distance when making the right hand placement. Now the climber is placing the fingers above the flat surface of the hold which is above and wraps the thumb around the edge of the hold. This helps the climber to close the grip and apply pressure when sustaining it.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So the climber is doing a good job here because as he's keeping his arms in a straight position, he's also doing a good thing of making sure that he's able to adjust his body weight from left and to the right. So then that way he can kind of get a better understanding of the movement that's required of him, which is going to be ultimately pushing off of the right leg to kind of guide him in the correct direction to the screen hold that he's aiming for. What I'm noticing is that as the climber is shifting from left to right, he kind of limits himself on how far to the right he does go. I think this is a little bit more important to focus on just because as he's pushing himself up and to the right, the climber definitely wants to be able to get a good understanding of how that tension and how that coordination feels. So because the climber is limiting himself in how far right he's going, he's making it so that he's unable to really get a full understanding of the coordination that's required of him. So that's just one thing I would kind of encourage in the starting position for the climber. And so here we can see that this is the point when the climber is kind of closest to grabbing onto the green hold with his right hand. And then as he's releasing all the points of contact from the wall, we can see that with his legs, that with his left leg it's kind of going upwards while his right leg is kind of going downwards. So this is kind of showing where the focus is on the climber and which foot he's pushing off. So it kind of shows that he's pushing a lot on the left foot to kind of push him up in the direction that he needs to go to. However, the climber should focus a little bit more on the right foot being the main foot to pushing him upwards. So because the right foot is going backwards, it's kind of showing to me that the climber isn't entirely pushing off of it. And it's kind of just there hanging onto the wall. And so I would definitely focus on the climber being able to produce more power on that right foot. And this could help him get him closer into the green hold because he was unable to grab it in the way that he did it for this move here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

And the moment the climber brings the hips against the wall, he will press the right toe harder so that he can gain height. And that way the climber is able to place the four fingers inside of the edge. As we can see the climber has made the move out of the hold with the left hand. This one because it was a type of grip that was more difficult to sustain and also is making the release of the left hand because it's on the direction that the climber needs to go for the next hold. As we can see the climber has brought himself to pull his center of gravity towards the wall. This is by raising the hips and the climber is stepping over on the highest foot. As we can see, the climber is performing some hand gestures. This is so the climber is able to visualize what to expect on the climb, as well as figuring out the sequence on when to make the next hand placement and how to hold on to it. As we can see the climber has sent the hand up for the sharp lip of the hueco hold. It's a hueco hold because the climber has a lot of space behind the sharp edge and he's only able to place two fingers on the hold. As we can see, two fingers would be difficult for him to sustain the hold. In this case he places the middle finger and the index finger. As we can see as well, he is pulling on it. So unless the climber has a lot of gripping strength on the fingers, he might be able to sustain the move. But also we can see how his center of gravity is really low and before he had swung out to the left to make the move, but now he's swinging over to the other side, meaning that he is overcompensating that grip, resulting to a potential fall. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start. The right hand being a pinch, the left hand being a small shallow hold. For the climber in order to apply pressure onto this ones he will have to apply pressure on the pinch by placing the thumb on the other side of the edge and the fingers on the other edge. This creating a clamping position the climber must pull away from the hold in order to sustain this press. And for the left hand the climber must keep the elbow close to the wall in order to generate pressure at the fingertips as the climber is keeping a closed grip with the fingertips pressing against the hold thinking of a knob. Now the climber will be able to start to climb until he places the feet on the wall which he is already ready on the first move.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

You can't see it super well in this frame, but basically their digits, their four sort of top digits are facing in this direction towards the body and that loads the shoulder a little bit more than the bicep. The issue with this is there would probably need to be a higher foot somewhere and this foot being as low as it is and also this foot being on just doesn't give enough opposition to be able to come in and match this jug this way, but I do think that it is a valid approach. I just don't think that it's supported enough with the feet. Climber then opts for the power approach and you can see they're getting into the hold but they're losing the foot as they move over it. And yeah I think that this is just a nature of this box being a bit too big. And I've expressed this in other videos.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So we are lifting the foot slightly off the ground, better contact point with the ball. But again, we can see the body position, feet not necessarily moving with the ball when we're reacting to the ball. The body is again, high hip placement, back is very upright and actually leaning backwards away from the direction that we're moving in. If we're moving effectively with the ball, for me, we would see this right knee over the ball, body starting to turn to the right. And then obviously the player is then able to get his chest and his head slightly further forward as we're moving in the next direction. Here's a player just finishing this sequence, you see the importance of the footwork. So the player shifts the ball from the left to the right. The left foot generally plants very quickly to the ground, very flat footed, not moving his feet with the ball. Takes a couple of slight little hop as he reaches for the ball. But generally as we move the ball, we wanna move our feet, move our body with the ball so we don't end up reaching there with this straight leg to try and regain control of the ball. We can see by not moving our feet together, that's gonna now affect our control, our balance. And now even if the player does stop the ball or regain control, it's now gonna take time for us to reset before we can push off and complete the next action. Players are always on the inside of the left foot. Again, very flat footed to the ground as we're moving, not very light on our feet. Contact with the ball, again, very low, keeping our feet low to the ground, very straight legs. So we're very rigid in our motion. We're keeping the ball close, but we're not effectively dribbling. We're kind of shuffling and walking with the ball. The feet aren't in a running pattern, so we're not really dribbling at any speed. As you can see now, the leg position leads to a very high hip placement, upright back, so the body is not really moving with the ball, which is controlled by a lot of the footwork and the surface of the foot that the player is utilising to dribble. Again, player with the left foot, so utilising the inside of the foot to change the direction of the ball. So heel down, toe up, again we can see the player's contact with the ball is really on the lower half of the ball, so we're kind of shuffling through the strike. We want to try and make contact with as close to the middle part of the ball with the inside of the curvature of the foot as possible so we can maximise the contact and the quality of the control. Again you can see the player's body position, very upright, very straight, high hip placement, back up straight, so although the body is leaning slightly forward you can see the head is well in front of the ball and with the legs straight and the body leaning forward that means that although our upper body momentum is moving forward, we're not in a fully controlled position and we want our knees to be bent, get our hips lower and get that ball out of our feet a little bit further so we're not leaning too far over the ball and losing our balance. Again, player dribbling with the inside of the left foot, contact very much closer to the toe area, which is a more rounded, harder surface, less contact between the ball and the foot, so we lose elements of control. We can also see the player, again, very upright position, straight leg to control the ball, feet are close together, so even with the slight bend in the right knee, hips in a very high position, back up straight, player is not effectively moving his body and his feet with the direction that the ball is traveling, so we're gonna lose elements of balance, control, and speed. Player here utilising the inside of the right foot. Again, you can see the contact with the ball now is closer to the big toe area. So we've lost a little element of control with our prior touch. And then as we take that heavier touch and move, we can see that the left leg, just based on the position of the right leg being nice and straight, and then the contact between the foot and the ball, that we haven't moved our body, moved our feet quickly enough behind the line of the ball to give ourselves the best possible chance to change direction at speed and under full control with good balance. So although this left knee is bending, you can still see the hips are very high because of the straight right leg. You can also see that the chest is facing one way, the hips are starting to turn the other. So the player is really fighting to just change direction and get the ball moving back between the cones. Once again, player dribbling, shifting the ball from right to left, looking to continue to move, see the footwork, again as he shifts it from the right to left, right foot becomes very planted to the ground, not moving his feet necessarily with the ball and behind the ball. The left foot making contact with the ball, you can see, very flat to the ground, so although he's presenting the inside surface of the foot, the ball is now going to be hitting the big toe area of the left foot, which is a harder surface and he's also making contact with the lower half of the ball, so the control element over the ball is limited. We want to maximise the surface area between the front of the ball, strike through the middle of the ball, inside curvature of the foot, get the left knee over the ball so we can start to bend our knees and get our body moving fluently with the direction of the ball. We're going to lose elements of control in these actions. As that right foot plants again, you can see again, straight left leg, high hip placement, back up straight, we want to make sure that we are bending our knees, getting our hips low to the ground, better centre of balance, provides improved agility, improved control, improved speed and can get our body moving with the ball. Player dribbling with the right foot. Again we can see although the body is starting to lean towards the left, see the body position is still relatively square. Some more from this angle here, you can see the body is still very square as he's turning his right toe in to make control with the side to the front of the ball. So as that ball is moving in a way, we want the player to be in a better balanced position with his knees bent, hips lower, body starting to turn in the direction he wants to go with his chest leaning slightly forward so we can generate the maximum amount of speed and control as we're dribbling through. Player dribbling here with the right foot. Again, we can see the contact with the ball is closer to the toe area of the foot, very flat-footed to the ground. So the player is obviously looking to move the ball across between the cones, but the body and the footwork is gonna make it difficult to maintain the control and the speed the player wants. We can see how close the feet are together on contact. So although this knee is slightly bent, we're not really gonna have a platform to be able to push off, change direction. Straight right leg, want that right knee for me to be bent and over the top of the ball. That's gonna help with our body position. Get this left foot slightly further back so we can push off that, maintain our balance. Low hip placement and starting to turn our body towards the direction we want the ball to go, just to help in terms of our changes, speed and direction. Player again using the inside of the right foot. So from the prior touch, see the player's not necessarily moving his feet. So he's not getting his body behind the ball, which leads to then this straight leg position with the right foot. So although the body is starting to turn and lean to the direction we wanna go, the body, it's not necessarily moving with the ball. So we're gonna be off balance as we make the touch this way. So the right foot is ultimately gonna have to land first before we can push off and move. And if the player is not in balance on making contact, that's gonna make it a little bit more difficult for the player to maintain control and generate any speed. You can also see again, there's no real bending the knee. So the body is very upright and straight. So we're kind of relying on our footwork to move the ball, not our body. Play utilising the inside of the left foot to maintain the dribbling sequence. You can see here inside of the foot, heel down, toes slightly up, still kind of hitting underneath of the ball. So when we kind of make contact with the ball, it's going to affect the quality and control. We want to try and strike through the middle of the ball so it's clean and concise and that maximises the surface area between the foot and the ball. You can see here with the straight left leg as he's making contact with the ball that we're not going to get our left knee over the ball and get our body moving effectively with it. That straight leg is going to mean we're going to make contact, potentially land on this left leg before we change direction. I like that the body is starting to lean and turn towards the direction that we want to go. So that's beneficial for the player. It's going to help the transition from moving to the left to the right. Play again, just looking to dribble with the left foot. More shuffling than dribbling. We can see the position of the foot. Very flat parallel to the ground. So when we're dribbling, ideally we want to be in a running motion. So as we're making contact with the ball, we're going to use the inside of the foot. It's to push through the middle of the ball with the inside of the foot, with the heel down, toe slightly up, and then moving in the same direction that the ball is traveling. Or dribbling with our laces, with our toe pointing down, so we're traveling with more speed. Here you can see the player is not in a running stance or stride. Very upright, legs straight, high hip placement. Body should be leaning towards the direction that we want to go, in terms of turning his hips, turning his chest, to improve the efficiency, the speed, the balance and the control that we have. and you can see from the prior touch, so although he utilized the inside of his right foot with the side of the ball, again, the body position and the contact with the ball meant the ball moved forward, so he wasn't necessarily moving his body with the ball and redirecting the ball with his technique. So we're now taking another touch with the inside of the right foot to try and move the ball through the cones. Once again, we can see as the player's moving forward, the body position is very much just straight forward here, hips forward, chest forward, legs not necessarily in a fluently running position, we're kind of shuffling with the ball, a little upright, high hip placement, so we want a lower center of gravity, better balance, better control, a better protection of the ball. Can also see as the body's up straight, the legs are up straight, so the body's slightly leaning forward with the head in front of the ball, so we're not gonna necessarily have full balance as we change direction. And we see the player dribbling now with his left foot. So once again, a key element for this player is as the player consistently moves the ball with the inside of his feet. On contact with the right foot, you see the right foot doesn't really move. It plants to the ground, stays in a very static position as the ball's traveling. And now the player's relying on now reaching out this left leg to make contact with the ball. So it's gonna have difficulty with two things in terms of the player's balance as the feet start to grow further apart and when they're reaching for the ball. Obviously the player, when he's not moving his feet with the ball, he's not gonna be in a good set position when he makes contact with the left foot to now move the ball and move his body effectively with the ball. So I wanna make sure as we shift the ball, we move our feet on contact with the inside of the left foot if that's the surface we're gonna use. We wanna make contact with the middle of the ball, get our left knee over the ball, bend our knees, get this right leg coming across, bend our knees so we get our hips lower, better balance, better control, better ability to push off that back leg. Get our body starting to turn as we get this left knee over the ball. So as we push the ball out into the space from left to right, our body is now moving in the same direction as the ball. We can generate better speed, better control. play a dribbling with the right foot so we can see again using the inside of the foot hard to see the exact part of the ball he's making contact with but from the position of the foot here you can see potentially the lower half of the ball which is going to affect the consistency and the quality of the touch run straight through the middle of the ball through the middle of the foot to change direction you can see again the body is very square to the direction we want to go on contact I'd like to see that body starting to turn towards the direction we want to go can we get our right knee over the ball when dribbling with our right foot to come that way the left knee sees bending which is which is good but you can see the straight leg we're reaching out leads to a higher hip placement so in terms of our ability to change direction protect the ball get better balance and control that's going to be affected by this body position here so it's important when the player is moving from side to side bending his knees getting low to the ground so we can change direction effectively and fluently player utilizing the inside of the right foot, using more of the big toe area, still kind of hitting with the lower half of the ball which is going to affect the speed and the efficiency that we can travel at as we're pushing the ball through this space. What I do like here is the body is starting to turn so you can see the body starting to turn to the left-hand side so as we push the ball through this gap if we can get our body moving with the ball that's going to improve our speed and balance and control. One thing I look for when we're using the inside of the foot is to really demonstrate that the body is moving with the ball, can we get the right knee over the ball that will bring the hips forward, the chest forward so we are moving in unison and with the direction of the ball improve our fluency, control and speed. And for me, dribbling is very much about the player's footwork. We can see as the player shifts the ball from left to right, from the, sorry, from right to left, the right foot stays very planted to the ground, very flat footed. So as the ball's traveling across, the body's not able to move across. So now we end up reaching with a straighter leg with the left leg, which is going to affect both our control, our speed and our balance. See the player again in a very upright position, hips nice and high, back up straight. So the player doesn't have full balance and control with the ability to now change direction at speed and effectively protect the ball. Again, once again, you can see as the player shifts the ball from left to right, I'm on contact with the left foot with the ball and the ball moves, the left foot stays pretty stuck in the mud, pretty flat. So as we're moving the ball to the left, we want to try and move our body with the ball, keep our feet agile and not just fully contacting to the ground. So as this left leg now plants, now we're reaching out with our right foot. So now we get this high hip placement and we're really just redirecting the ball, not dribbling with it. Back up straight. Again, we can see the position, the contact between the foot and the ball onto the big toe area, which is going to limit our control of the ball. Looks like we're hitting the lower half of the ball. We want to try and get as much contact through the ball as possible. If we're changing direction effectively, you'd like to see this right knee over the ball, which will bring the hips forward and get the body starting to turn in the direction that we want to go. Player again, he's keeping the ball really close to his feet, but he's not effectively dribbling with the ball. Again, we can see that just through the position with the contact with the ball and the cone, very close to the cone. So we're not in full control of this outcome based goal of dribbling through the cones. See the feet very flat to the ground. I want to see the player working more on the balls of the feet, moving his feet with the ball. So when he's making contact with the inside of the right foot, we're making contact with the middle of the ball, heel down, toe up. So we maximize the control and quality of the touch. We can once again see the body position of the player is very high. So we're not really bending our knees too great. High hips, high upright back position. So we're kind of allowing the ball to hit our feet as opposed to us moving our feet with the ball, making good quality contact with the ball and effectively dribbling in the same direction as the ball is going and having full control and speed. Again we look at the player dribbling from his right foot to his left as the player makes contact with his right foot across. His right foot plants to the ground and doesn't move with the ball. So we want to be on the balls of our feet, more light on our feet so now we don't end up in this position where our right foot's not moving, the ball's travelling from right to left and now we reach out with this straight leg to try and regain control. Because even if we make contact with the inside of the foot with the right part of the ball, as the ball's travelling this way, the feet are still going to have to readjust before we can move with the ball. So we want to make sure that we are moving our feet with the ball, getting our left knee in a position over the ball, but the only way we can do that is by moving that right foot first and then we can start to talk about getting our body in a position where we are now moving in the same direction the ball is going. Here you can see on contact we want the ball to go this way, but the hips and the body are all facing in a different direction so the speed at which we change direction is going to be impacted. As you can see here, the player is using the right foot to shift it across to the left. As soon as the right foot makes contact with the ground, it plants very firmly into the ground so he's very flat footed. This has been a constant with the player, not necessarily moving his feet with the ball, shifting the ball with one touch to the other and then he ends up with this straight leg with the left foot making contact with the ball and just redirecting the ball rather than dribbling with it. Once again, you can see from the distance that the feet are apart, he's not moving with the ball, leads to these straight legs, high hips. The ball is moving but the body is not moving in line with the ball. Again, we can see as he's making contact with the left foot with the ball to turn it to the right, the hips and the chest are still facing directly forward towards the left. On contact, we want that body to start to turn this way and to do that, we've got to move our feet first to get our body in a better set position to be able to do so. The player here dribbling the ball from left to right, almost shuffling the ball. You can see again the player takes a little two-step to get his body behind the ball, but on making contact with the ball we can see the position of the feet very close together, very upright in his stance, high hips, back up straight. Again, we're not really putting ourselves in a position where we can dribble with any element of speed, both with our footwork and our body position. The player is keeping the ball close, but very underneath his body and his feet. So we can see the feet very flat-footed, hitting again the very bottom part of the side of the ball, so we're not going to really maximise the control and accuracy as we're dribbling. So we want to try and strike through the middle of the ball, get our feet slightly further apart, bend our knees, low hip placement. As we're making contact with the ball, we want more of a knee over the top of the ball, left foot moving back, body in a more effective position to move with the dribbling action. Once again, players are on the inside of the right foot, we see how flat their feet are to the ground, so although we're utilising the inside of the foot, we're hitting, kind of just letting the ball hit our feet, hitting the lower half of the ball, so we're not really fully controlling the ball or mastering the technique of the ball. We see from the ball position to the cone where the player wants to go, we're not necessarily getting the outcome goals that we ideally want. Feet, legs, again, feet not really moving behind the line of the ball to help the player change direction and travel at speed efficiently. High hip placement, which means we're going to have less balance as we change direction, less ball protection, less ability to push off at speed. Upright back, so we want to try and bend these knees, get the hips lower so we can get our chest leaning slightly forward, getting our hips and our chest turning towards the direction we want the ball to go, and making sure that the player is not just solely focused on the ball throughout the action, but keeping glancing up and around to check his surroundings and build better awareness of the situation around him. Once again, player dribbling with the right foot. So although when we talk about dribbling, we wanna keep the ball close, we wanna make sure that we are in a good, solid foundation position for my body. So when we change direction, we're not fully over the top of the ball or the ball stuck under our feet. So again, you can see the elements of control just through the activity. When the player's changing direction, we can see how close the ball is to the cone. So we can see that the player doesn't have full control over the ball throughout the dribbling sequence. We can see the feet very flat, very planted to the ground. So he's losing elements of mobility. The contact point with the ball again is with the inside of the foot, but with the lower half of the ball, because of how close his feet are to the ground, we want that foot to be higher, making contact through the middle of the ball for the maximum contact and control. We wanna make sure that we're moving our feet in a way that allows us now to change direction, get our left knee over the ball, bend our right knee, which would be the foot that we can push off as we move with the ball, get our hips low, start to get our hips turning as we make contact with the ball. Here on contact with the right foot, you can see the body is still very square and facing forwards. On contact, we'd like to see the body starting to turn with the ball so we can effectively move at speed and when we've better balance and control. and player changing direction with the left foot. We can see from the body position, the footwork, player again, utilizing inside of the left foot. We are making contact with the lower half of the ball, which is not gonna maximize the contact, the accuracy, the weight that we're dribbling at. With the change of direction, we can see that the feet, again, the body is not necessarily moving with the ball. The feet are relatively at distance. We have moved that body. We can see a straight leg with the right leg. I'm making contact here. I'd like to see the right knee over the ball. That helps us turn our hips, turn our chest towards the direction that we wanna go and have control, speed, and balance. We can see the high hip placement. Again, the higher the hips, the more upright we are. We see from the back position. So we lose elements of balance, control, and the ability to change direction effectively at speed. Again, the player just losing elements of control as the ball comes from the right across to his left. So here the player does move his feet a little bit more, but still you can see from this really long straight leg, the position of the foot, toe pointing down and striking kind of the front side to lower off of the ball. Not in full control of our body as we're moving and dribbling with the ball. So although the knee is bending, the hips are facing and the chest is turning towards where we want to go, we want to see the knee slightly bent, hips in a low body position, low central gravity so we can now really make contact with this ball through the gap and then push off and you get our body moving in the same direction that we're moving the ball. Again, here the body very upright, head really behind the line of the ball so we want to be more fluent in our action. Player dribbling with the inside of the right foot. Again, we can see a little flat footed as the player is shuffling. Feet low to the ground. Looks again like we're making contact with the lower half of the ball. I'd like to see the foot slightly higher through the middle of the ball. Again, we're very upright in our position, so I want to bend these knees. Lower our hips as we make contact with the ball with the right foot. For me, I'd like to see the body beginning to turn a little bit more in the direction we want to go. We can see the chest and the hips are still facing forward, very square. When we're making contact to come to the right, I'd like to see that body start to turn. And also get obviously lower to the ground so we can get our body moving more effectively with the ball at speed and with greater balance. Once again, player loses elements of control so as the ball travels across his body, we can see the player again reaching out with this straight left leg and the distance between the right foot and the left foot are growing further apart so as the player makes contact with the ball the balance is going to be off. You can also see the player off balance because of the position of his left foot as he's trying to control. If we're changing direction with the inside of the left foot, I'd like to see the heel down, toe slightly up, striking through the middle of the ball in the direction he wants to go with his left knee closer to being vertically on top of the ball which would then bring the body forward and in a better position to move in unison with the ball. We can see the player is really reaching out for the ball and he's still in a very upright position, high hip placement so we're not getting good balance, good control, ability to change direction with speed. Player dribbling with the left foot, so although we can see the toe pointing slightly up, it's very low to the ground, very flat footed in the player's motion, hitting the underside part of the ball, so we're not really maximising our control and accuracy, we're going to end up scooping the ball, we want to strike through the middle of the ball, so we want this left foot to be higher, lock his ankle, get his knees bent over the ball, again the right foot not really moving in a position where now the player can change direction and push off, so we have this straight leg, we have this high hip placement, back up straight, so the body is not really moving fluently with the ball. You can see again the contact point with the ball, big toe area, bottom of the ball, we're not going to have maximum control to move the ball through this gap, and you can also see from the distance between the ball and the body, and the body position, the player is not effectively moving his body with the ball. If he is doing that, we'd see this left knee closer to on top of the ball, and the chest moving in the same direction the ball is travelling. The player utilising the inside of his feet to change direction and dribble through the cones left to right. So just starting with the footwork we can see the players foot is in a decent position, heel down, toe up through the middle of the ball. That's going to maximise the control. We can see the player is making contact with a very straight leg. You can see from his left leg bending here, the distance between the two feet are a little far apart so we don't have the balance and the fluidity to change direction effectively. We can also see the hip placement is high. We want a lower hip placement, better balance, lower centre of gravity. As we're making contact with the ball, here with the left side of the ball, we want to try and make sure that we're getting our knee over the ball which brings our hips and our body closer to the ball, turning towards the direction we want to go. Player again using the inside of the left foot, we can see here the toe is pointing slightly up but the heel is really close to the ground, still hitting the lower half of the ball, it's going to affect elements of our control and speed. We can see the body position through the position of the legs and the distance the feet are apart, the player is not necessarily moving his body in line with the ball or with the ball. We can see the lower hip placement, upright back, so we want to see the knees bent, hips lower, chest leaning slightly forward, hips and chest then turning towards the direction we want to go to maximise the efficiency and speed at which we are dribbling. Player utilising the inside of the left foot. So again, toe pointing straight out through the ball. We can see the player again, straight leg position, not really moving the right foot with the ball. So we're kind of really relying on just the contact with the right foot to the left and the left to the right to move the ball, not really utilising our body. And we can see that through the high hips, the back up straight. Here you can see the head and the chest are leaning slightly back from the direction of the ball. So just lose elements of that control, balance and speed. player dribbling with the left foot again we can see contact with the ball although we are making contact here with the inside of the left foot meaning contact with the lower half of the ball we can see how flat the feet are to the ground we see the straight legs that's going to impact the players balance control and speed and we'd want to make sure making contact again it looks like we're hitting through the bottom of the ball foot needs to raise up get his knee slightly higher so we have better control and cushion as we're dribbling and changing direction with the inside of the foot get this right knee bent hips nice and low so we can increase or improve our low central gravity helps with our balance control and speed over the ball and get our chest slightly leaning forward in the direction we want the ball to go again we can see on impact the ball is going to be traveling this way but the body is still very square and pointing in a very straight direction so we're going to really impact our ability to effectively change direction and speed and under control As the player just finishes the action here, shifting the ball from his left to the right. Again you can see, although here the body is leaning forward slightly, you can see that the legs are very upright, high hips, so regardless of the body moving with the ball, if we don't have that, better balance in our lower body, bending our knees, getting our hips lower to the ground, we're just going to knock ourselves off balance and the ball obviously being very close to our feet is one thing, but being under our body in this position is going to make it very difficult for the player to push off with any kind of speed or be able to change direction quickly from this body position. So we want to get our knees bent, hips low, yes body leaning forward, ball close to our feet but still moving slightly out in front of us so we can maintain our balance and that allows us to have more success in different areas when related to dribbling. Player again dribbling through the cones left to right we can see with a position with the ball in relation to the cone the player doesn't necessarily have control of the direction or the weight of how he's dribbling with the ball. You can also see that he continues to dribble with his feet very flat to the ground, toes pointing forward so he's kind of shuffling through and not really running with speed. If we're running with elements of speed we'll see the toes pointing down slightly more as we're going through and then changing into this action where the heel is down, toe up, pushing through the middle of the ball to change direction and obviously we're trying to avoid the cone so our previous touch would be more into the space to create that space to move through. We can again see the fluency of the running action, player very upright although his left leg is bent and we can see the body in a very upright position high hips we want our hips to be lower as the player is starting to push the ball to the right, we want to see these hips starting to turn to the right, chest starting to turn to the right or sorry to the wards the left the direction the ball wants to go so we can make the action more fluent. Again, using the inside of the left foot, again not necessarily dribbling in a fluent running action. You see that from the feet position, where they are, the straight legs. So again, when the legs are straight, it's going to lead to a higher hip position. And the body now is upright, his head is over the ball, but obviously the body is not necessarily moving with the ball. So we want to make sure that we are bending our knees, getting our hips lower to the ground, increases the balance, the control, the ability to generate and change direction at speed, utilizing our arms for balance, making sure that the contact point with the ball is behind the line that we want the ball to go. Here you can see the toe pointing forward, making contact with the front to the left. So we're really relying just on, you know, just shuffling our feet, moving our feet with it rather than fully controlling the direction of the ball. Again, we're talking about dribbling, we want to keep the ball close, we want to be moving with the ball as much as we can. So a lot of that is the footwork of the player. And when we are dribbling with the inside of the foot, but both feet are staying relatively flat to the ground, not working on the balls of our feet, makes everything else in terms of the body position, the ball control, the speed at which we can dribble very difficult. So we can see again, as the player is moving the ball across not necessarily moving his feet. So we can see that again with the left leg position, although the right knee is bent, the hips are still very high, the back's upright and actually leaning back away from the direction we want to go, which is effectively forwards. We're changing direction obviously to the right, but we want to go forward. So as we're making contact with the left foot, we'd want to see left foot through the middle of the ball, left knee moving closer to on top of the ball, which is going to help our body start to turn towards the ball and get our chest leaning slightly further forward in a position over the ball so we can move effectively at speed. Again, prioritising the inside of the left foot to change direction. So here, foot's in a relatively decent position, but we can see that we're making contact more with the underside of the ball rather than really controlling and maximising the touch through the middle of the ball into the space. We can also see that the body is not moving in line with the ball, so we want the body to move across with the ball so we can continue to maintain our balance and change direction. You can see from the position of the right foot that that right foot is really planted to the ground and now we're reaching out a little bit with the left. So in terms of our balance and control, we lose elements of that. We can also see the hips very high, back up straight, so the player in terms of his effectiveness in changing direction from left to right is going to be limited throughout the action. Here again, player kind of just shifting the ball with the inside of his left foot to his right. We can see obviously the contact with the ball foot is relatively low to the ground. So we're making contact with this lower half of the ball. Again, we can see if the outcome of the exercise is to dribble through these spaces in the cone, we can see the position with the ball and the cone on contact with the ball with the right foot is very close. So we don't have full control in terms of the outcome from the player. And we can see the body is very, very, very straight, very square to the direction he wants to go. And so when we're making contact with the right foot with the inside of the ball to travel to the left, we wanna be in a better position where our knees are bent. So we get our hips lower to the ground, move our feet with the ball and on contact, get our body starting to turn towards the direction we want the ball to go. So we can be more fluent in our action, generate better control, better balance, better speed. player dribbling with the right foot. Again, we can see from this example here, it's more about the player shuffling with the ball and the contact with the ball, as opposed to the footwork and the balance of the player. So we can see here the left foot very close to the right and effectively in the direction that we wanna go. We can see the contact point between the ball again is with the inside of the foot, but the foot is very low to the ground, very flat footed, so we're striking the ball through the lower half of the ball, so we don't really have full control over where the ball is gonna be going. We also see again, the ball very close to him, but very much under his body and his feet, making it very difficult to travel at speed and with control. Upright body position with the legs straight, high hip placement, back up straight, the ball is actually gonna be moving left and the body is leaning back. So the player's footwork, his control of the ball and his body movements to move with the ball is gonna slow him down and affect his control and ability to move freely. Play again utilising the inside of his right foot to change direction. We can see everything aligned with the player is basically pointing forwards and in the direction towards the right side of the cone. So in contact with the right foot, inside of the right foot with the left of the ball, we're ultimately looking to change direction. So on contact, I'd be looking for the player to start to adjust his body position to move towards the left. We can see the player's feet relatively close together, which is going to lead to a more upright position, high hip placement, back up straight so the player doesn't have maximum amount of balance, agility, fluency in terms of his change of direction and moving the ball from right to left. Again, player dribbling with the inside of the right foot. So although the toe is pointing slightly up, you can see the contact with the ball on the lower part of the ball. So we're not really maximizing our contact and control. Legs, again, very straight, not really moving with the ball. So we wanna bend our knees so we can get our hips lower to the ground, which is gonna allow us better balance, better control, better change of speed. Very upright back position. And again, the body not really turning with the ball. So the player is kind of moving the ball left to right with the inside of his feet, but his body is not necessarily moving the ball, which is gonna impact our ability to protect the ball and our ability to change speed.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

They again did a great job at transitioning from a softer, more delicate section of their piece into a more louder, fuller section of the piece that has some more intensity to it. Here the pianist did a good job at quickly shifting tonalities. They were playing previously in a different key and now are playing this next section or phrase in a new key. Here the pianist is playing an incorrect chord in their left hand part. Again here, an extra key or incorrect pitch was played due to finger aim. Right hand finger 3 bumped into an extra key so an incorrect pitch was heard here, but the pianist is continuing on and maintaining a steady tempo while they continue performing the rest of this phrase. Here the pianist is playing a very rhythmically challenging phrase in their piece. You see them hand crossing as well as finger crossing to play the rapid succession of notes, and they are doing so with proper technique. In this section of the piece, the pianist is doing a great job at playing with a legato, or smooth and connected articulation. Most of the time, they are also incorporating accented notes or notes with a stronger attack that sound a bit more aggressive into their phrase to make it sound more interesting and musical. Here the pianist did a great job at watching their right hand fingers and making sure they expanded their fingers and that they land it on the correct keys to play the next pitches in the phrase. Here, the low E flat played by the left hand thumb sounded rather loud and abrupt. This was due to the nature of the instrument and the pianist did not intend to play this pitch louder than the rest of the pitches in their phrase. Here the pianist is doing a great job at continuing to play with a legato articulation and they are showing control, they are playing at a softer dynamic level. Here the pianist successfully shifted their left hand a great distance on the piano. They were playing some lower pitches towards the left side of the piano, and they quickly moved more towards the middle or center of the piano and landed on the correct key to play the next pitch in the phrase. Here you can see the pianist demonstrating great left and right hand position. All of their fingers are curved over the keys of the piano, which is helping them perform this phrase with clear, correct pitches. Here you can see both the left and right hand fingers are extended to cover and play a wider range of pitches. Here you can see that I'm pressing down right hand fingers 1, 3, and 5 to play this particular chord and the right hand fingers are curved or rounded over the keys. The pianist is now continuing to play their bass line part in just the left hand, and they are playing the melodic line in their right hand. Here the pianist played an incorrect pitch with their right hand pinky at first. They played this black key on the piano and then they quickly slid their pinky to correct their mistake in pitch and to play the correct key that was needed. Here the pianist did a good job at transitioning to their next section of the piece smoothly. They were previously playing with a louder, fuller dynamic level and their notes had stronger attacks and now they are playing at a softer, more delicate dynamic level with legato or smooth and connected notes. Here you can see the pianist quickly gliding their right hand fingers across numerous black keys of the piano, which allows them to play a sequence of notes very rapidly, and it adds a cool sound effect to the piece. Again, here the pianist is doing a good job at varying their melody. They are adding some grace notes or extra notes to embellish this phrase. The pianist is doing a great job at aligning their right and left hand parts together rhythmically and they are making some nice choices with articulation. You hear them accenting or emphasizing certain notes as well as playing some notes in the phrase more staccato or short and separated. The pianist is performing their second piece. They are playing with a beautiful legato articulation. Their notes are smooth and connected. They are playing more of an accompaniment part in their left hand and the melodic line in their right hand. The pianist did not let their few mistakes in pitch affect the rest of the phrase. They are continuing on in maintaining a steady tempo and playing the rest of the phrase with pitch accuracy. The pianist is continuing to perform this section of the piece with great pitch accuracy at a full loud volume level. The pianist is performing this section of the piece with a full loud dynamic level and they are playing with great pitch and rhythmic accuracy. Here the pianist is doing a great job at performing these two pitches repeatedly and rapidly with right hand fingers three and four. Here they are starting to add some accented or emphasized notes to build up the intensity of this phrase. The pianist is continuing to perform this piece with great stylistic choices. They are playing with great musicality and pitch and rhythmic accuracy. Here the pianist is doing a great job at gradually slowing down towards the end of this phrase which will allow them to transition more naturally and musically into their next section of the piece. The pianist is performing a bass line in their left hand part, and they are performing chords in their right hand part. They are playing both parts with great pitch accuracy, and they are shifting from one chord shape to the next very effortlessly. Again here the pianist did a great job at transitioning from a louder, more aggressive section of the piece to a very soft, delicate section instantly and seamlessly. It would help to watch the right hand fingers a bit more here to make sure that they are landing on the correct keys to play the pitches that are needed in this phrase. The right hand is shifting on the keyboard repeatedly to cover different ranges of pitches in the melody, and each time they are shifting, they are landing on the correct key and playing the pitch that is needed next in the phrase. Here you see the pianist crossing their right hand under their left hand to play the next pitches in their phrase. It sounded like there may have been an error in pitch made here. It would help to review and practice each hand's part alone a few times, checking for pitch accuracy, Here the pianist is playing an incorrect pitch with their right hand pinky. The aim of the pinky seems to be off again. They are playing a C when they should be playing a B, which is one white key to the left or a half step lower. The pianist is playing their lower pitches in their left hand and they are playing chords or multiple pitches at the same time in their right hand part. They are shifting from one chord to the next with great pitch accuracy. Here the pianist is performing a baseline part using their left and right hands. You can see the left hand fingers are extended to cover a wider range of notes. They are also using fingers 2 and 3 on the right hand to perform this part. The pianist is doing a good job at continuing to shift great distances on the keyboard with their left hand. They were playing a more smooth, delicate phrase in the piece that was higher in range and they quickly shifted here to this spot on the keyboard more towards the left of the instrument to play a more aggressive, louder phrase in the piece. They were successful at transitioning from one style to the next. They quickly shifted their left hand and moved their left hand pinky to the next highest black key on the piano to correct their mistake in pitch and they are continuing on with the rest of their phrase. Again, here the pianist is doing a great job at shifting to different spots on the keyboard to cover and play a wider range of notes in this phrase. Here, when performing the chord progression in the left hand part, the pianist could have slowed down a bit more gradually to make this transition into the next section of the piece sound more natural and flowing. Here you can see some finger crossing in the left hand part as the pianist is traveling towards lower pitches on the keyboard. The pianist is continuing to shift their left hand back and forth to different spots on the keyboard very quickly and accurately. Here the pianist has shifted their style of playing. They are playing a jazzier sounding piece now with some syncopated rhythms. The pianist is performing this section of the piece with nice legato or smooth and connected notes. They are maintaining a steady playing speed and are playing with great pitch and rhythmic accuracy. Here you see the pianist using their right hand fingers to play the white keys of the piano. They are moving right to left on the keyboard quickly to play these pitches in rapid succession. That pianist is continuing to play the melody in their right hand part as well as some chords or when multiple pitches are played at once. The pianist is doing a great job at playing this piece at an even consistent tempo with a nice full clear tone. They are adding some grace notes to their melody to embellish it a bit. Here the pianist did a great job again at transitioning into this next section of the piece. They are playing with a very beautiful, delicate, clear tone and at a softer dynamic level. You can see the pianist is alternating between using their left hand thumb and Fingers two and three at the same time on the right hand. So they're doing thumb two and three thumb two and three back and forth to play this repeating pitch with a faster speed and rhythm It's not typical to use two fingers to play one key at the same time, but they may be doing this to Play a bit faster and have a bit more strength and weight to their sound Here, there is the slightest bit of hesitation before beginning the next phrase of the piece. It would help to practice the previous phrase in the piece leading into this next phrase a few times to get this transition to go more smoothly and to be able to maintain a more consistent tempo here.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The ball, his hand is under the ball, which indicates he's probably going to try to put some English on it versus powering up. So just being aware of this drill, you want to have two hands on it. Two hands are going up at the same time and flicking your wrist with the left hand and finding the best spot on the backboard to give yourself a chance to make a layup. Good job coming off the left foot, finishing with the right hand.  Grabbing it with one hand is not ideal. You want to grab that thing with two hands, alright, and protect it at all times.

And as the climber is swinging herself back and forth, we can see that she is focusing a lot on how much her arms are pulling her up and down. So as she's getting this movement, it's kind of a good idea to do this back and forth, where it's giving the climber the idea of the type of movement that they're going to be committing to. However, by focusing on her upper body here, she's not really focusing so much on what's going on with her lower body, which could make it hard to complete the move. Just because our legs are stronger muscles, and they will always produce more power. So it's always kind of nice to make sure that the climber is focused a little bit more on what's going on with their legs, and trying to keep their arms straight to help produce the accurate amount of power that they need. So here we can see the climber is committing to going for that long pillow hold over to her left right now. And as she's committing to the move, we can see how much both of her arms are in a flexed position. So again, this kind of shows how much the climber is focusing on her upper body to complete this movement. But because she's pulling so much with the upper body, this is actually displacing some of her body weight on her left foot. And as a result, we can see that her left foot is sliding off of that full hold that she was on. So this prevents her from completely getting to this yellow hold that she's aiming for. So I would definitely encourage the climber to kind of keep her arms a little bit straighter and reinforce how much she's using her left leg. So then that way you can help prevent that left foot from sliding off the full hold. And that way she can also use the power from that foot to guide her up in the direction that she needs to.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

They should make sure that their vibrato is a little bit more constant. The vules has a slight vibrato in their hand going. They can work on having more of a continuous vibrato that they're transferring their vibrato between one finger to another. The fuel just adds a little bit of weight into the string to accent these notes. They could probably actually do a little bit more to help match their duet partner who is giving a lot. The violist brings up their viola to create a cue so that they know when to play with their duet partner. The Buells is using less speed in the bow currently to create more of a denser sound. The Vuel starts at the tip of the bow for a softer sound. To release the sound, the violist is taking the bow off the string and having to follow through with it. This will get more ring in the string. He also uses a good full bow to get a fuller sound. The viola is playing with a straight bow that's parallel with the bridge. This is great for a consistent, clean sound. As they're getting closer to the frog, they're adding more weight to create a crescendo.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So he's kicking one and two and three, backwards on four and. That's very good. He got back on rhythm, but most of his dancing in general is not on rhythm with the music that is playing. Again, these circular movements in which he's raising his arm to turn the dancer or his imaginary partner are not really necessary. It's also difficult to practice this because there is no partner to measure the height of. If the dancer is taller, for instance, his arm would have to be extended higher up. If the dancer was shorter, his imaginary partner, then he would have to be moving his arm further down. So it's good to know that you'd be turning a dancer or a partner potentially, but because he is dancing solo, he should be fully engaged in dancing by himself instead of with an imaginary partner that doesn't exist. The dancer's feet here are a bit lazy when he's doing the triple step 1, 2, 3. Step 1, his feet should be apart, but step 2, his feet should come closer together, and then step 3, they would be apart again. He doesn't really ever complete step 2 in which his feet are together, so it should be clearly apart, together, apart, or 1, 2, 3, but the together part here is missing. When the dancer is kicking his legs forward into the side, he should be extending his energy further out of his head so that he's standing tall, especially he is a tall person to begin with, but he's not using his verticality fully. He's not engaging all of it. So he can make his body even longer by extending out of his head his energy upward. The dancer is doing a good job of facing all different directions. He faces various parts of the room. His body is facing all different ways, which is good. It shows that he can dance three-dimensionally and use each direction in the space. The dancer is off rhythm here. The music is very fast and he is not dancing fast enough to keep up with the rhythm of the music so his musicality here is off. He can't make sure that he is on rhythm entirely or continuously by making sure that he is counting at the same pace from beginning to end and not speeding up. Each count that he's saying should be equidistant from the last count that he just said. So each number that he says should be the same amount of time apart from the last one that he said. The dancer is kicking his legs outward with energy. He's also jumping up and down when he's kicking them both forwards and backwards and he does a good job of straightening his legs. He can work on now straightening his legs even further and kicking them out with even more energy but what he is doing is a good start. It's also important for him not to be doing these arm movements that he would be doing with a partner, given no partner is present, because these arm movements also are a consequence or a result of having a connection with your partner. It's not just putting your arm up to turn the partner, it's him and this partner connecting and timing and in rhythm and in energy together to be turned. So it's not really as efficient to just practice the arm movements here without knowing if the partner would be ready then. And also he and the partner's arms would be moving together in space lifting up and him just practicing lifting his arm movements right now by himself, prepares him to be not connected with his partner, to be disconnected with his partner when they would be dancing together. So it's better off that he is not practicing these arm movements like this because it would just emphasize him being disconnected and not actually working with that partner in tandem with each other. Again, on these rock steps, if his arm is going to be extended like this for a partner, he has to really practice in his upper body pulling backwards since the partner would be holding hands with him and also would be pulling backwards. So in this instance, his arm really should be straight because the tension from each other would be pulling them apart even though they're remaining connected at their hands. Their arms should be straight as their backs would be pulling away. So he's not really practicing this step completely. He's missing that weight balance or the weight shift part where he'd be pulling backwards in space towards our right side of the screen away from his partner, his imaginary partner. The dancer is sometimes looking downward, which isn't necessary, especially if he's practicing to dance with a partner. Eye contact would be very important. So he has to practice with his eyes upright because he would be making eye contact with his partner either to, if he's the leader, to be directing his partner on which way and how fast or wherever they're going, the steps he would be in charge of. So it's important that he would be communicating through his eyes and making eye contact with his partner to make sure that they're in coordination with each other. So it's better off that he starts lifting his head now instead of looking downward. The dancer is bringing his arm over his head as if he is turning a partner or dancing with a partner. This is swing dance so it often is a partner dance but right here he's dancing by himself so mimicking these arm positions that he would do with a partner are not necessary and it actually makes him look a bit awkward because there is no partner there so it's better if he dances as if he is dancing by himself which is what he is doing. The dancer also can't practice hand holds because the partner is not here. So what his hand is doing, he's not able to be interlocking fingers or practicing a transition of where the hands would glide against each other. And it would be better if he was able to practice that if he had a partner. But since the partner is not there, there's not much of a point in bringing his arm upward like this, especially because he's not going to be actually executing it in the way that's meant to be given a whole person is missing. It's good that the dancer is just freestyling like this before he starts his routine, just to feel the music and to get into his body. This is a good way to prepare before you begin dancing. When the dancer is doing these triple steps, he can be traveling further in space. He's a bit stationary here, staying in one position, but he really has much more of the dance floor to be using. So it would be better if he traveled on those triple steps. The rock steps, when he's crossing his legs behind each other, which is where he is right now, those are meant to be stationary, but those triple steps or one, two, three steps in between can be used not only to change direction as he has been doing well, but also to travel further in space, so to take up all the rest of the space that he has. The dancer is able to change direction on these kicks because he's turning his torso from right to left and from left to right. And that is helping him turn his entire body by leading with this torso area of his body. So once that part of his body turns, his legs are also following suit. So he's able to dance in tandem his upper body and his lower body because they're directionally facing the same way. The dancer should make sure when he's doing the triple steps or the one, two, three fast steps in a series of three that his weight is shifted onto his toes. That way he can travel across the ground easily and is not hindering himself by having his heels on the floor. It's much harder to travel once your heels are on the floor and it prohibits you from traveling quickly and easily. This arm movement in which he would be extending his arm out and the other dancer, that would be his partner, would be pulling away from him. So they would be pulling away from each other. Is not very efficient to be practicing here either because he doesn't have the counterbalance. He doesn't have the weight of the other person that would be present here for him to be pulling away from. If it's very imperative for him to be practicing his arm movements as if there was a partner, then he really should here be pulling his torso backwards into space. Because in reality, if he was dancing with another partner that was here and connecting arms with him, that partner would also be pulling backwards into space. So there would be more tension in his extended hand, his left hand that's extended. It would be kind of like a rubber band. They would be pulling apart. And he doesn't really have that elasticity or he's not demonstrating that elasticity, which is difficult to practice by yourself. But he can help himself practice by pulling his weight and his upper body backwards, as if that person was also there pulling backwards. He has to kind of create that elasticity and that type of tension in his arms for himself right here since the weight of his partner is not there to assist him. The dancer is preparing to start his movement but he is a bit awkward in doing this. His arms and his legs are moving which is fine and good but they're moving a bit independent from his spine. So both his arms and his legs or these limbs are connected through his center and all come radiating from his spine. So these movements should be further connected to his back because at the end of the day these body parts are connected to the vertebrae. The dancer is also counting in rhythm when he's counting off the music here before he starts dancing. However, towards the end of this counting he begins to speed up a bit which will allow or force him to get off rhythm eventually. If he keeps speeding up he begins completely on rhythm and by the time that he's counting here he's barely on rhythm anymore. He's inching to being off rhythm.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

As we can see when the climber was engaging into a forceful pull up to make the move out left, the right leg is continued to be extended. The right foot is not an actual hold, but is pressing against the wall. This will help the climber to when he makes the pull up, to go for the direction out for the throw. Because the climber will be pressing down on the lower foot as he continues to keep his left foot over the hold. The climber is shaking his hands. This will help the climber to release any tension that may be built up, especially if he had already attempted climbing the wall before. Also, shaking them helps tendons to get loosened up and warming the hands up. Here the climber has dropped the weight after making a small movement at the feet, potentially also because the hands weren't wrapped deeply into the hold. So this compromised the climber from sustaining the holds by creating friction and also the climber having power grip to sustain the hold. If the climber drops the weight, this will add extra energy for the climber to engage and the reason why the climber has slipped off from the wall. It's important that the climber glances over at the feet. He does a hop to release the left foot to let the right foot take place. The left foot being placed was from the bottom side of the shoe and the outer edge, which is not the most ideal when he got himself first into position since for climbing it's ideal to press down on the toe box area, which is where the right foot is going to take place over the hold. Here the climber is starting at a one hold start, meaning that both hands will be placed in the same hold. And the type of hold that the climber is holding onto is flat at the top. So the climber in order to place pressure will have to bring the elbows to stay lower right under the hold. Once the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall and presses the feet and the climber comes into position by raising the hips off the mat then the climb will start.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

She's turning completely to her left side for this first pose and then turning completely to the right side on the second pose. This is a cool little like freestyle moment where I think your hands could probably go anywhere, but she chooses on her head and then to her waist. But just really nice changing of directions and staying with the music. So this next part, she does two turns around. She'll step salsa front and turn, drawing her arms up over her head and around. And I really like how she uses the arms. During this part, she takes her right arm and brushes across her left arm that's out. And just adds a little extra feel to her arms so it's not just her arms drawing up as she turns and brings them down, she adds a little more personal style to it. So in the beginning, the dancer is stepping side to side, and she's swinging her arms up in almost like a half-moon position to her right and her left. She's also kind of accenting the beat, and she does a little pop with her chest and her arms. So it's not just her swinging side to side, but she's one and two and, just to give it a little extra. So that's really nice. So even though she messed up a lot in this one, I think she had some really strong moments when she was doing the choreography. It was correct, just the transitions and doing the things full out until she's done with that phrase to move into the next one. So even if you mess up, this is a good way to just improvise and keep doing the same step until you're ready to move on to the next or because this is salsa, just going back and forth with the either front and back salsa step or side to side salsa step so you continue moving. So here she's doing the step touches where her arms are drawing up and forward. Again, I think she forgot what was coming next, but if she would have just stayed in the moment and kind of continued doing that step until she was ready to move on to the next one, it just would have been a lot cleaner transition into the next step. So this next step, she starts to, I think, forget what she's supposed to do. But if she would have just kept going and stayed in the music, it would have been fine. She's stepping to her left and her right on the 1, 2, 3 beat. And she's drawing her arm around her chest and in front. She has really nice arm usage for this part. It's drawing the attention to the eye. And if she would have just kept on going and stayed on it, I think she would have got back on the music. It wouldn't have stopped.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Though they have a nice bend in their knees It would benefit from dropping the pelvis back so that they're more grounded which would help them to perform this twist a bit more quickly And efficiently. They would also benefit from finding some clarity in the incorporation of their arms in this movement As the dancer performs this ball change with their feet that locomotes them slightly from side to side in the space, they have a lot of nice clarity in their footwork. However, they would benefit from bending their knees more deeply and dropping their pelvis back to be more grounded, which would then activate a greater range of motion in their pelvis, which would help them to connect more deeply to the rhythm. As the dancer begins with a stationary basic step touch where they're reaching one foot out to the side, meeting it back in the middle, and then alternating sides, they've got a nice deep bend in their knees as well as some nice clarity in their footwork and incorporation of their arms. However, while they're incorporating their movement up through their body, they have a lot of extraneous movement happening from their pelvis up through their torso, which while it feels appropriate in this moment, I worry will keep them from being able to transition quickly into the next movement, especially as the tempo begins to pick up. The dancer appears to struggle through this transitional moment. They're struggling to find clarity in the shaping of their body. They're hesitant to connect to the rhythm. And lost all that nice kind of bend in their knees that they had prior, which is helping to ground them in their movement. Overall, some additional rehearsal would be needed to kind of find some clarity and some refinement here. As the dancer performs this body roll, they have a fair amount of motion happening through their head and their torso. However, they would benefit from finding a deeper articulation all the way from the top of the head through the shoulders, the spine, and through the pelvis, which would help them to perform the body roll a bit more fully while staying more deeply connected to the rhythm. As the dancer transitions into a salsa step that locomotes them forwards and backwards in the space, they have a lot of nice clarity in their footwork as well as incorporation of their arms. However, their arms could use a bit of loosening up as they appear a little bit stiff as they're moving through this movement. Overall, they appear confident, though they would benefit from being a bit more tightly connected to the rhythm.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

We have to be careful of our placement of the ball on the backboard and making sure that we're on the right side that we stay away from the middle portion of the square and we're looking to place the ball on the right corner of the square. If we hit this right corner of the square it will go in the basket every single time He just slightly put it too far to the left because of the placement on the backboard from where he released it and the angle he released it we end up missing the layup. If we look at the placement of this shot, he hits the ball inside of the square, but on the top line of the square. So as it's near the top right corner of the square, that's the area we're looking to aim for. He places the ball nicely there, and it goes, and he places the ball nicely in the top right corner, which is the spot we're looking to hit on the layup, and it goes nicely into the basket. Here he shows the proper footwork and jumping technique when you're jumping off of one foot for a right hand reverse layup. Here you see he jumps off of his left foot, which is the correct foot when we want to jump, when we want to do a right hand reverse layup. We want to make sure we jump off this left foot. Also he does a good job of lifting up his right knee as he jumps, getting that right knee up to his hip level. By us getting that knee up to the level of our hip, this allows us to explode up higher into the air as we jump and it gives us the thrust to reach the maximum point of our jump in the air. This allows us to reach the apex of our jump as we go into the air. on this attempt is he places it inside the square and on the top portion of the square however it hits the backboard closer to the middle section of the square so from the angle where he released the ball the momentum is carrying the ball and now is going to hit the left side of the rim on this shot attempt it was able to stay just barely inside the rim and go into the basket but we have to be careful not to place the ball too much to the middle or towards the left side of the square from the right side of the basket otherwise we run the risk of missing the shot long on the left side As he releases the ball, he does a good job of releasing the ball high and away from his frame, thereby releasing the ball at the highest possible point of his jump. As you can see, his arm is extended out, which is a good position to make sure the ball is extended and away from the defense, and then we release the ball at the highest possible point. He also does a good job of holding up that left arm to protect the shot as he releases the layup. Having this arm here protects the ball from the defense who is on his inside left shoulder and they're attempting to contest or block the shot. That left arm will slow the defense down just long enough to allow him to release the ball out of his right hand and onto the basket before the defense has the opportunity to block or contest their shot.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Keeping the arms extended helps the climber not engage the upper body for when he would need to use it moving out of the stance. Here we can see the climber has swapped his feet by placing the right toe onto a foot chip and brings the right leg with the knee pointing inwards. This is so that the climber has an easier time transferring the right hand over to the left side by keeping the right side of the body towards the wall to help with the reach on the right hand. Now the left leg being extended, this is called flagging out. The climber does this so that he can support and balance most force to drive it onto the foot that's being placed, being the right foot. Now we can see that leg extended, this is called flagging out, and also aids the climber to keep the right side towards the wall by pressing down on the toe, touching the wall to help with twist. Here it's unsure as what the climbers next move would be and it's important to know where the hands and feet placement need to be for the climber to engage on releasing the hand whether it's going left or right, the hand placement is important and it needs to be accurate so that the climber doesn't get tired out or doesn't get to hurt themselves in this case creating so much pressure on one of the grips. Here the climber is chucking up his hands and this will help the climber to gain a better grip on the holds. Also this will help the climber to absorb any sweat that may be coming from his hands. Here, the right hand being placed on top of the left hand is actually creating a lot of pressure for the left hand. So something that the climber is doing is trying to find position on the feet, but is unable to achieve the position on the feet, potentially because of the pressure that is bothering the climber at this time due to the hand positioning. Here the climber seems to struggle to get the hands positioned onto the same hold. This is a very shallow hold and also a small donut. So it means that the climber is trying to really get both hands onto the same hold. When both hands are in the same hold, that's called matching. And also the type of movement that the climber is doing is placing one hand over the other. Here we can see the climber getting positioned into two hold start. Now, this means that each hand is going to be in its own hold and both of the holds are donuts, meaning that the climber is able to pinch and grip on it. So, not only he is pinching it, but also can lay forcefully by relying on the top fingers of each hand hold while keeping arms extended. Now, the climb will start until the climber gets to place the feet on the wall and the body is off the ground.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This will allow the climber coming over in front of him to apply the left foot to come into a high foot placement. Now the climber was able to place that left hand and immediately moves the right hand over to a larger hold. This one is a slightly sloped so the climber must bring the hand as far in to be placed with the palm towards the hold so that he is able to press the hold with the fingers. Now the climber was figuring out and shifting the weight and now he is able to bring his center of gravity underneath the grips. Because of the right hand being sloped, the climber needs to continue to apply surface to the hold to give it friction. Now it is important that the climber continues to stay underneath the hold placement, especially for the right hand. Bringing the elbow close to the wall will help the climber sustain the grip. Because the climbers hold is a distance over to the right side, the climber right now is adjusting on pivoting over the right foot that he just placed. This will potentially bring the left knee to come over to the left side being outwards to get his center of gravity close to the wall. However, the grips are at his chest height which will make it difficult for him to sustain even if sustaining two good holds. The climber is glancing over to the next move at reach. This one seems to have concave areas side to side and potential being able to pinch onto the hold once committing to it. As we can see the climber brought the right foot to come into place and keeps the left arm extended to transfer over the weight to the highest grip. Now that the climber had placed the foot he's able to keep himself close to the wall by pulling onto the right hand grip and whenever he's ready he will lower then he center of gravity and push hard onto the left toe that is placed against the wall. He will then press against the wall as imagining at a foothold on a smear and he will then get lowered and push by extending the leg to send himself over at the direction at reach to release the right hand to make the hand placement. Once that climber pushes the left foot his left leg will be extended going out on a flag to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place and the leg being extended will help him keep in balance over the move. The climber chose to keep the right foot dropped, being on the flag, to make one move ahead, this one coming onto a pinch grip where the climber, instead of using the thumb to one side of the hold, he uses the ball of the palm to press into it with the fingers. Once the climber gets the squeeze onto the hold and secured the grip in the climber, the climber glances down at the right foot to bring it over to place in the one that he had planned out to. The climber has made a couple moves from the start till now with the right leg extended. This is called flagging out and is so the climber can continue to apply pressure to the left foot being in place. Also flagging helps the climber to have stability and balance when performing the moves as well as keeping his hips square to keep himself close to the wall. Here we can see how the climber's main area of support to gain height was to stand up on the right foot after pushing with the left toe against the wall to gain direction. And he pulled himself in to bring himself close to the wall. Now the left leg extended. This is called flagging out. So the climber is able to balance over his areas of support in order to make the reach. As this was a quick move, being dynamic, bumping up to the jug, the climber had dropped the weight immediately, losing pressure at the right foot. And so the climber at this moment is sustaining to two good grips, mainly the one at the jug with the left hand. The right hand, the climber is continuing on the pinch to sustain the grip to keep himself close to the wall. But when the feet come out of contact from the wall, this is called cutting feet. So whenever the climber is ready, he will engage in the core to tighten it up to pick up the feet in order to make a high foot placement. The climber brings the left hand to come out and match the last hold. The climb will be determined completed if the climber is able to demonstrate control over sustaining the grip as well as stability of his body when sustaining the hold. The climber had released the left foot from its foot placement and having a hang on space so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the right foot being in place and quickly engages on a pull up of the right hand so that he was able to release the left hand to bring it over to a higher placement. This is a good choice as the climber's left hand previously was on the pinch hold with restricted movement as the wrist was locked and the elbow was towards the wall. So making a bump up to this hold, the climber is able to be more free on sustaining the edge of the hold as jugs can be held at any direction while being gripped. Due to the climber sustaining to the right hand that is open-handed, it is much harder to grip than the left hand pinch. We can see at this view that the climber's right hand is actually a wide pinch and this is still hard to grip as the climber will have to press the fingers onto the hold in order to sustain the grip. But the climber needs to continue to have his center of gravity underneath the holds that he is gripping at this moment, the reason why the climber keeps the elbows down as much as he can and presses down on the right foot being in place in order to gain height. Once the climber has gained sufficient height, he is able to lock the grips and locking the move of the arm being engaged so that he can now move on potentially the right hand since it's not the best grip to sustain to the last hold. The climbers are starting at a one-hold start. As we can see, both of the hands applied onto the same hold. This is called matching. And the climber places the fingers above the hold and the thumb to be wrapped at the bottom of the hold. This is called a pinch grip, as the climber will be able to squeeze onto the hold in order to create pressure. Now, the climber is standing on the mat. Once the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing in the mat, then the climb will start. The climber figure to continue to bring the left knee to point inwards while continuing to have the same foot placements and sending the left hand across immediately for making the hand placement while sustaining the right hand grip. The climber transferring the right foot a distance to be placed. He had brought his left knee inwards. This so the climber is able to keep his center of gravity close to the wall and steady when making the transition. While sustaining the left hand grip, it's important to note that the elbow needs to be pretty close to the wall. This is because the climber is locking the wrist to sustain the palm pressing against the hold. As the climber brought the right hand over to the last hold, we can see this one being a positive grip as the climber is able to curl the fingers behind the edge of the hold, being a jog. For the climber to achieve the reach, he had to pull himself as close as he can, locking the move and bringing his chest as far in as he can. The left leg being extended throughout the move, this is called flagging out and helps the climber to transfer the weight to the highest foot being in place. And also to balance over his areas of support when sending the right hand out. Also helps the climber to stabilize and staying in place his core close to the wall by pressing on the toe against the wall. It is important that the climber glances down when making a foot placement. This time the climber brings the right foot that was out on the flag to come into a high foot placement. This is when the climber places the ball of the foot at the edge of the hold. The plan for him is to roll the toe on top of the hold. In this case, once the climber is ready to pull onto the highest grip, he will then secure the right foot placement, transferring over the weight to the highest foot to release the left foot from its place. The climber is stepping off the right foot to place it onto the wall. He transfers over the weight to the areas in contact, being the left toe pressing down on the foot, so that he can bring his hips close to the wall. And on the grips he's pulling on them, now that he has placed the weight.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So bending a little bit more forward, bending here in the waist and bending here in the knee. Again, creating that 3D perspective when we're looking onto the dancer from the viewer's perspective rather than it being a flat 2D sort of image. When the dancer is moving, whether they're putting out the left leg or the right leg, when we walk, we walk with one foot stepping in front and then the opposite arm moves in front with it. We don't move where the leg and the arm move together on both sides. And the dancer is moving in this way with the movements instead of it being more alternating. And I think that if the dancer would move that way and loosen up here in the upper body and in the arms, the movement would look more natural and less robotic. If the dancer can look out and also change their focus depending upon the direction that they go, the movement would also feel a bit more organic and more pedestrian rather than steps that the dancer is trying to go through.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So thinking about the different movement qualities of space, time, and energy will definitely increase the overall look and feel of this dance. The dancer does a really good job of gliding on the balls of their feet and spotting their head to get around seamlessly and transition to the next step. So kudos to them for this advanced salsa. The dancer does a really good job of thinking about being strong and sharp and using those staccato movements. So I would like the dancer in this phrase to think about really when can they be soft and change the movement quality and also when can they incorporate more groundedness and use of the hips. I'll repeat my kind of previous comments from this video, which would be to make sure that they have more attack and are really grounded. The dancer has a really great attack at this moment and precision, so I would encourage them to push this even further to the limit. I would encourage them to drop their weight, especially right before this moment here, so that they can really articulate their hips and swivel and sway before they reach this kind of pivotal moment. I would encourage a dancer to be really strong in their arms, particularly at this moment.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He's starting off on this kind of pinch grip. His right left foot is kind of towing in. And as he makes his first move, and let's go with his left hand, his right hand just dry fires off this thing. So I think number one, kind of getting a little more tension at the start. Two, he's kind of, his body position is a little bit more to the right. So I think by kind of lowering underneath this pinch, you know, so his arms are kind of plumb line straight under, kind of sagging his hips down. I think tension up this right foot into a back leg to give him a little extra power or flagging the foot out to the right to kind of provide a little bit of a tension, a little movement up through his arms. But I think by relaxing into this, he could be starting so high and up to the right. I think kind of relaxing under it could help a whole lot.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So now he's put all of the chopped vegetables into a bowl. Here's where his fingers are vulnerable. See where he's holding his cucumber with his fingers pushed out. He should be pressing his fingertips down on the cutting, I mean, on the cucumber, and actually using a flat cut side of them. He's holding the whole barrel and it's already cut, and cucumbers are wet inside, so they tend to slip. It's just probably not the best use of his hand to be holding all four pieces at once. Here he's cut it in half, so he has two halves. He's cut it in half crosswise. Now he's got some grape tomatoes he's cutting and he's about to try to employ that same thing it looks like because his hand is on the tip of this which um I would well let's see what happens. And he's using a technique that's pretty good for keeping your hands out of the way by holding the top of his knife down and then using this hand right here to rock the knife over the onions. It kind of is an indication that he's not very comfortable with his knife and that he's sort of just chopping at it, but it still is better than putting his fingers in jeopardy. Now what would be better is if he actually flattened this hand over the tip of the knife and didn't hold it so close. But again, fingers out of the way is what you're going for. He's cut the end off. Here he has a small cucumber. It's like a mini cucumber. Kind of popular these days. It is an English cucumber with very few or any seeds that is kind of harvested when it's young. Nir's taking a spoon and he's able to stir everything together so you want everything to get well coated. You want the salt and the pepper to be well distributed and everything to be mixed together. I would like to assert that his onion ratio to the rest of the vegetables is off balance and he probably needs to dial back the onion by at least half. He has very little tomato, a little bit of cucumber, and then a whole lot of onion. And here he's adding some oil of some sort. Oil is a great addition. It's got a very slick mouth feel against the cool vegetables. The salt is going to bring out liquid in the vegetables, which will mingle again with the oil nicely and they will have a good flavor depending on what kind of oil you use. And you can use any kind of oil from a toasted walnut oil to this may be just an olive oil. And now he's opted to just cut in half. And he's adding some freshly ground black pepper, which is a delicious addition, a little bit of heat, not hot, hot heat, unless he just puts a ton on there, but it's very fresh and earthy, especially when it's freshly ground. So to start I'd say typically you don't sit down to cut. Now I'm not exactly sure what the circumstances here. He does have adequate counter space that is regular height to cut on. He just may be used to doing it this way but I would encourage anyone at the beginning of their culinary journey to not take this as the norm. It's not a good position to be in. It's you just don't have a lot of control when you're seated and cutting. And here he goes back to that sort of chop thing. Now he's turned it again to get another cut. That would kind of give him four sticks. Yeah, so I would not do that with a tomato. First of all, tomatoes are round, so they roll. You wanna make sure you've got control over the tomato itself. And second of all, it's just not a good way to cut them. They don't really lend themselves because they have that hollow sort of wet inside. They're just gonna kind of squish. and a sprinkle of salt. And you can see this kind of spells onion a lot of places. He has to bring it back into a central group, but he is able to accomplish kind of cutting that onion down by using this technique. So, but not being probably very confident or competent in the kitchen, this is a fairly smart play. So he has some already sliced onion here. They're in slivers, and he's just moved a handful of them to his cutting board.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

He has originally continued to sustain into two areas of support and had made a move before making this other move consecutively. Now the left hand, he's sustaining it with an entry at the top where he gets to slide the fingers behind the edge of the hold. And as we can see, the climber keeps the right leg extended. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to balance over the moves and helps the climber transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place. Here the climber has dropped the right foot from its place to extend the leg. This is called flagging out. Now because the foot is on space, then he's able to transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place. Now the climber is pushing down on the left foot being in place and pulling himself down on that right hand grip in order to release the left hand from its placement. The climber brings the left foot at a high foot placement and presses the middle of the foot against the hold. This so that he can push away from the hold in order to stay underneath his grips. The climber brings the right hand to come into a match by touching the hold. And the climber must demonstrate controlling the stability over his body positioning when making the move up to the last hold. Once the climber is able to demonstrate this, then he has completed the climb. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet when making a new foot placement. On this one he's sending the left foot into a small foot chip. And this has a small edge so it's important that the climber is exact on how to place the edge of his toe towards the small edge of that foot chip. Once the climber gets to apply pressure into that higher foot placement, then he will bring his center of gravity close to the wall to then transfer over the weight to the left foot. The climber brings the right hand to come into a match at the same hold. This is a jug so the climber is able to wrap the fingers behind the edge of the hold and extend the arms. This is called a rest position because this is good to make for recovering when performing the route as he had brought his right foot up into a higher foot placement. Now the climber is able to glance over at this time to plan the next move and whenever he is ready he will then engage on a pull up and step up over the highest foot being in place. The climber is applying his hands inside of a chalk bucket. This is a white powder that the climber will cover up the palms in order to gain a better grip when sustaining to the holds of the wall, as well as absorbing any sweat that may be coming from his hands. The climber was able to bring the left hand two consecutive times. So after making one move and does a move once again, this is called bumping, especially when only continuing to stay in the same areas of support when making the move. As the climber secured the right hand grip being on a pinch hold which is wide, this one the climber must apply friction by closing the grip and dropping the weight. So in this case the climber will have to force with the elbow pulling down in order to sustain the right hand grip. As we can see the climber once making the hand placement he adjusts the left foot to roll the toe to come above the hold and releases the right foot in this moment to transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place. The climbers are starting on a two-hand hold start. On each hand, the climber has slightly two different sizes of holds. So the left hand, he's holding onto a jug where he's able to place the fingertips behind the edge of the hold. And this one has a thick lip, so the climber can place the thumb on the outside to sustain the hold by squeezing the grip. Now, with the right hand, the climber is sustaining to an open-hand grip. This one, he's able to cup it by sending the thumb over to the left side and applying the fingers above the hold. Because this is open-hand, the climber must apply friction in order to sustain the grip. And we'll have to drop the weight by keeping the arms extended in order to sustain the right-hand grip. So now the climber is placing the right foot onto the wall, and the climb will start until he's no longer standing on to the mat and the feet are onto the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

The action of having the off arm up to protect the shot protects the ball from the defense who's coming from his left side attempting to block or contest the shot. They will have to come across his left arm, which will be a foul, or if the referee doesn't call a foul, this arm will be able to slow the defense down long enough for the offensive player to release the ball from his right hand before the defense has the opportunity to block or contest the shot. After he makes a layup on the left side of the basket, the ball goes through the net. He catches the ball and he does a sort of a hop step to the right side of the basket where he ends up stepping with his right foot and then he's going to pick up his left foot and bring it closer to his right foot so that his right foot would be positioned here and then his left foot is positioned here and then he's going to jump off of two feet to shoot the ball on the right side of the basket. This is the incorrect footwork as when the ball goes through the net, he wants to be in position where he can catch the ball, but as he's catching the ball, he steps to the right side of the rim with his left foot first and then he wants, after he catches the ball, he wants to swing his right foot to square himself up to the basket. So now that he has his left foot positioned here and his right foot positioned here, now he jumps off of two feet in order to shoot the ball on the right side of the basket. The player here is demonstrating the Mike and Drew where you jump off of two feet to shoot each layup and as he's on the right side of the basket, he correctly shoots the ball with his right hand. Looking at the placement of the ball on the backboard, we can see here that he places the ball in the upper right corner of the square on the backboard. Since he was able to hit the upper right corner of the square from the right side of the basket on his layup attempt, the ball was able to bounce off of the backboard and drop in for the made layup. After he makes a layup on the right side of the basket, he uses the proper footwork as he catches the ball. He steps to the left side of the basket with his right foot, and then he swings his left foot into position to where it is on the ground right now. So he has great positioning with his right foot here and his left foot here. All he has to do is go up and jump and shoot the ball with his left hand on the left side of the basket. However, he's going to end up picking up his right foot and placing it even closer to his left foot in order for him to jump for his shot. By him picking up his right foot and placing it closer to his left foot, that makes the footwork that he demonstrated incorrect. As what he just, what he demonstrates right here is a travel, but if he was able to just jump immediately from this position where his feet are now and not pick up this foot and place it closer to his left foot, but if he just would have left his feet as they currently are and immediately jump and shot the ball with his left hand, that would be the correct footwork. The shooter is now on the left side of the basket and shooting a layup on the left side of the rim and he is using his right hand to shoot the layup. When we are on the left side of the basket during the mic and drill we want to shoot the layup with our left hand and we do not want to shoot the ball with our right hand or have the shot be a two-handed shot. The release of the ball should only be with our left hand on the left side of the basket during the mic and drill.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Reaching over into the screen hold right here. So in this starting position we can see the clamber is doing a good job of keeping his arms in a straight position. While his legs are in a bent position here showing that the clamber has a good understanding of where the most amount of strength can come from which is going to be his legs. So you definitely want to be able to get yourself in this loaded position here so then that way it sets you up as a clamber to be able to produce the most amount of power for this dino. So this is a good starting position to see from the clamber. So here we can see the climber is now moving upwards into the dyno. But what I'm noticing from the climber is that he is actually allowing himself to kind of internally rotate his right knee over to the left. So what the climber is doing by doing it in this fashion, he's actually using the left foot to kind of push himself off of that foot. So that he can kind of direct a lot of his body weight over to the right. And then as he maintains his right foot on that foothold, he rotates the knee so that the right side of his body gets closer to the wall. And by doing that, it helps to actually decrease the reach that he needs to do with the right hand. So this is a really good idea from the climber in order to try and incorporate his hips into the movement to try and complete this dyno. So let's see what ends up happening.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Not only is their heads down, but their energy also ends up being kind of down here to the ground. So by looking up it would raise their head and fix their alignment a little bit. And then I would also encourage them to roll those shoulders forward, up, and back so they exude confidence. Here, for this whole last section, all of my previous comments apply. So, yes, being really strong and really taking the time to go back to the drawing board and practice because this dance has really good bones or a really good structure. Like the dancers know what they're supposed to be doing. They have an idea. They're connected. But really adding in all those layers of rhythm and musicality, space, cutting across space, taking bigger steps, understanding how to be grounded, how to be lifted in the chest and the head and the neck. Understanding the partner connection and the mechanics of that will increase the overall quality of the dance and the overall proficiency of this choreography. Here I repeat my previous comments about really being strong with the footwork, using your body as a percussive instrument. Notice how the dancers are looking down, and I would also encourage them to roll those shoulders again forward, up, and back, and just take bigger steps and be, have much more energy and strength and attack throughout this entire dance. Notice how both dancers are looking at the floor. I would encourage them to look up and out or look at each other to have that stronger mind-body connection to the music and as well as to each other. I would encourage the dancers to be more grounded. So when they're more grounded, then they'll be able to spin each other with more ease and really working with spinning one finger. So maybe holding that pointer or index finger and then using the other hand. The dancer, the opposite dancer uses the other hand to kind of spin around it. Those are just like little details to help them, especially for this strong connection here in the arms to be able to communicate with each other. Because this dance is based in a lot of footwork, I would encourage the dancers to be very clear about where they're articulating the foot. Is it whole foot? Is it half of the foot? Is it the ball of the foot? Is it the heel? Is it the side of the foot? This is very crucial in a dance like this, especially because we can audibly hear the steps. And because we can audibly hear the steps, the next layer of that is to making sure that they're both in sync and really tight with the steps that they are attempting to do. We can physically hear when they are together versus when they're not. So it's very important that the dancers work on nailing the footwork. So it becomes more of similar to the qualities of a tap dance where you can hear when somebody messes up, right? So really being clear about those footwork or it becomes like a drill team kind of step dance where you're really heavily reliant on the rhythm. So the dancers need to be very strong in what the rhythms are and using their body as a percussive instrument in order for this to work. I would encourage the dancers to take way bigger steps, especially for this eight count basic, and to be more grounded. So they have a nice plie here, but sending those hips back would allow them to be able to kind of do this swing under curve, where they kind of push their hips on this pendulum to go different directions in space. Having that bigger, wider stance and taking bigger steps will help them to be able to cut across space quickly in the future.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

This will result in an overcooked and relatively rubbery end product. So the idea is to minimize the handling of the egg and definitely not flipping it over continuously. Here the egg has been flipped over and you have visible browning from the underside of the egg. In a classic omelet, the egg is not flipped at all and the goal is to not have any browning on the egg. Oil is being added to the saut\u00e9 pan. Oil is an acceptable fat that can be used to make an omelette. Traditionally, a classic French omelette is made utilizing clarified butter as the fat. The preparer has selected a saut\u00e9 pan, which is the proper pan shape to choose. In this case, it should be slightly smaller in diameter than the one that is chosen, typically 6 to 8 inches in diameter or 15 to 20 centimeters. Here the egg is folded in half, which is the proper procedure for a classic omelet. Here the technique of tilting the pan so that any uncooked egg slides to the edges and then underneath to be cooked is the proper procedure to use. The egg mixture is being added to the saute pan, and there is a loud sizzle when that egg is added to the pan. This is an indication that the pan is too hot, and you will likely have browning of the egg mixture, which is what you're trying to avoid. In order to prevent this from happening, a much lower flame on a consistent basis will give you a better end product. Here you have chopped onion and chili, raw, that are being added to the bowl in which the egg will be added to. Any vegetables to be added to an omelette should be saut\u00e9ed first, separate from the eggs, and then added at the end when the omelette is complete. Here you notice a relatively high flame underneath the saut\u00e9 pan. In order to prevent your egg mixture from browning, it's best to work with a very low flame when making a French omelette. The egg is being mixed using a spoon. A better choice for mixing the egg would be a fork or a whisk. This way you would be able to thoroughly mix the white and the yolk together. With the spoon you end up getting streaks of white in with your egg mixture. Here one egg is selected to make the omelet. It is being cracked and placed into the bowl with the raw onions and the raw chili. For a classic French omelet you would need to choose a minimum of two eggs, maximum of three eggs to create the end product of a classic omelet.", "proficiency_level": "Novice"}

That way the dancer can release more here in the pelvis and have more mobility in the hips and in the waist.

Maybe maybe he's going off a little bit too soon. Maybe that's throwing off the accuracy of the shot on the glass. But again, she picks it up off that dribble and puts that right hand under the ball. And again, I love this shooting hand, the right hand to be behind the ball and left hand on the side. Pick it up like that and then shoot the ball out in front of the right chest. I love this one big dribble she takes and I'll show you this it's so important maybe get her eyes up here a little bit but one big dribble out in front of you see it's not beside her she pushes it out in front of her and that momentum of that power dribble sets up the footwork. Again, just beautiful footwork, pushing off the left, pulling the right knee up, squaring her hips, raising the ball here with two hands, I believe. This might be the guide hand coming off. Looks like a little bit better here. The ball's a little bit more behind, but that has a lot to do with the accuracy, how it comes off that shooting hand. Again, two hands on the ball, she takes it up, nice job, good footwork, plant, lift, trying to get that angle here. All this is really nice. She has really good intentions here. I just wish she would move that right hand a little bit behind the ball, take it up with two hands, and just soft touch on this square. Again, just really good footwork, uses that one dribble to set up the footwork, plant the left. Here, see how she's got her hand under the ball. Wish she'd just pulled that hand more behind the ball, keep that left hand on a little longer. I think that's why she loses control a little bit as it leaves her hand. Here's the lift, push off that left foot, pull the right leg. You know, she's doing everything right. Looking at the ball, the ball may be coming off a little bit too early. She may be shooting it a little bit too early. It's hard to tell. But she is shooting it underhanded. I like her shooting hand to maybe be a little bit more behind the ball. You just don't have as much control when you shoot it underhanded. I will add that. Much better here. I think the ball has a chance, but she's still shooting it underhanded, scooping it. Again, not as fluid, not as fundamental as you'd like to see. Again, she has beautiful footwork, beautiful extension, covers a lot of space here. I just would love to, I think this is why she's missing the marks, is, you know, that right hand moves underneath the ball, left hand comes off a little bit too soon, and she's kind of lifting it instead of shooting it. Therefore, just again, with one hand, you lose a little bit of the control when it comes off that hand. You don't really know where it's going to go. Yeah, she's still under shooting it underhand and I just think it's throwing off a little bit of the accuracy of the shot. Again, I really love this. She's got some ups, pushing offs, using it to help her square up, but I love, you know, it has to do with her hand placement on the ball after the dribble. Let's get that shooting hand more behind the ball instead of under the ball. Again, here's that foot takeoff left, pulls that right leg in, squares her body. I'd like this guide arm to kind of be up here a little bit more to kind of balance the body, hold off a defender. She brings it back, therefore the weight shifts this way a little bit. Pretty good extension. Again, that ball's a little behind the hand. Let's get that ball out in front of the hand here. Here's the lift. Yeah, she's got her right hand under the ball again, just doesn't have as much control of it coming out at hand. Let's move that right hand to behind the ball and let's shoot the ball out in front of our right shoulder. Good work here with the feet. There it is, left foot plant followed by that right leg, two hands, eyes are up. The participant is moving left to right to shoot a reverse, right hand reverse layup. She goes off the correct foot, has really good lifts, squares her hips. You know, I just think she's got a little bit of the angle here to hit the top of the square, but I love how the ball's coming off these fingers here. But she's got really good ups here. Nice look. Here's the shot. Much better with that. She's still lifting it. I think this is the palm of the hand. Here's the index finger, the thumb. Again, probably he's throwing off where it hits on the backboard. But beautiful footwork. Gets up off the ground very nicely. But she does do a good job of squaring up. You know, I think this is better here. I think the hands here on the side, which is a lot better. Good extension here. She's got some ups too. I like that. See, she's got it, she's got that ball on the palm of her hand. Again, that's, and then starting the shot right here, loses it a little bit as she lets go of it. But good footwork, good extension here of the right knee. Here's the lift. Again, we kind of would want this elbow to be more straight. Snap the follow-through hand down. Again, it looks like it's going to hit the top of the square here, but I love her footwork. Does a great job with that. And, you know, she ends up a little bit too far under, kind of misses the mark here. See the ball's hitting up here. I just think it's when you toss, shoot it underhanded, you again don't have as much control of the ball coming off the hand. But lands a little awkward here off balance, would like to have a better landing here. Takes a nice big dribble here to set up her footwork. Love how her eyes go up. She's got two hands on the basketball, being strong with the ball as she moves left to right.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This is a great position for his elbow to be as he releases the ball. As the elbow is above his eye level, that creates the good arc on the ball and for it to go into the basket. We take a look at the shooter's shooting hand or his right hand. He does a great job of snapping his wrist and giving a nice follow through and allowing, by him snapping his wrist and allowing the ball to roll off his fingertips, he creates great backspin on the ball and the ball is spinning towards the basket with backspin. So we want to make sure that we have this good follow through with our shooting hand and snapping the wrist and from this view you can see the back of his hand, back of his right hand so that lets you know that he did a great job of snapping his wrist, follow throughing with the shot and creating that backspin on the ball. As the shooter raises the ball above his head and is in the process of releasing the ball towards the basket, he slightly turns his wrist, he slightly turns his right wrist, and now that slight turn puts his hand, his right hand, in the correct position underneath the ball. And now he's able to have the ball nice in his dominant right shooting hand, and perfectly underneath the ball and centered underneath the ball in order to release the shot. At the same time, he begins, as the ball is moving towards the basket, he begins to move his left hand away from the ball, from behind the ball, opening that hand up and then clearing the path for the ball to shoot to the basket. So the ending of his shot, he gets to the correct position. Ideally, we would like for him to have this positioning with his left hand and his right guy, his right guy hand, excuse me, with his right shooting hand and his left guy hand. With this ending position that he is right now, we would ideally would like to have his hand in that position as he's raising the ball up from here upward into the correct position. His hand should already be in this correct position. But he's able to make a good amount of shots because the end point of his release is the correct position. We take a look at the shooter's placement of his feet. You can see that his right foot is slightly in front of his left foot. By his right foot being slightly in front of his left foot, that allows for his elbow to be lined up with the front of the rim. And with the elbow lined up with the front of the rim, it guarantees that our shot is gonna go straight into the direction of our release and towards our intended target. As the shooter brings the ball up, you can see his right hand is on the side of the ball, on the right side of the ball. His left hand is on the upper left portion of the ball, but more behind the ball. Ideally, we want this left hand to be on the side of the ball as he's raising the ball up, putting it into the shooting position above his head and goes into the shot. We want that hand more on the side and positioning that right hand more over to the left side to more in this middle portion of the ball. You see his right index finger is in the correct position as it's in the middle of the ball, but it's on the middle of the ball, but on the right side, on the outside portion of the ball. Here you can see he catches the ball and he takes his first step with his left foot. As a right-handed shooter, if I want to create momentum for my shot and create a good momentum and a good rhythm into my shot, I want to catch the ball and step with that left foot as I'm catching the ball and then I take my right foot and swing it into position and step into the correct position to go up into my shot. Right-handed shooter does a great job of using the proper footwork to step into his shot, creating the momentum and the rhythm to where he can go into his shot and it feels comfortable and natural and go up and release the shot. We take a look at the shooter's guide hand. His guide hand is in the perfect position as his hand is open and the palm is directly facing the direction of his release hand. His wrist isn't turned on that left hand to where his palm is facing downward to the ground or is actually pointing at the rim. The palm is facing directly to the right. So this is the perfect position for the palm to be facing. Now as you see his fingers on his guide hand are actually pointing towards the rim. So as he releases the ball his fingers on his guide hand go towards the direction of the basket. That is perfectly fine. This is something that is based off the shooter's comfort level. So his fingers on his left guide hand can be on the release pointing towards the basket like the shooter's is or it can be his fingers pointing straight up and down on the release. Whatever is most comfortable for the shooter. But as long as the palm is open and facing directly to the right that is a great position for the guide hand.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So see how the ball's kind of falling behind his fingers? Again, it's slipping as it comes out of the hand. Therefore, it's kind of going to, where it wants to go, may be thrown off. We need to use this other non-shooting hand to help balance our body as we lift it up. Again, he just lets the ball kind of drop into his hands. He does keep his eyes up. I do give him that, but ideally we want to move from side to side and flow and have rhythm. It's also a rebound and drill as we move to shoot the ball on each side of the basket. Again, puts it in the palm of that hand, brings it down really low, easily a turnover. While the weight sort of shifts to that left foot, we want to step through on the right foot and pull the left knee up. We need to really utilize the non-shooting hand to help support and balance the basketball prior to the shot. So see how he just sits the ball in the left palm, here's the right arm, no use of the feet to help lift and elevate him up. He's just kind of trying to hook it up over the backboard. Not a lot of, I don't know, not a lot of control in that. It's just again, just the ball's just loosely sitting there and not ideal. Here's how you just kind of lifts it up because the ball's sitting on the palm. We need to get this guide hand on and really step through with that left foot and pull that right knee up. Here again, he just kind of flicks it up, standing underneath the net. Not real good spacing and angle here. This is a really tough shot to make. Here's the shot, he kind of flicks it up. I mean, it may go in, but the percentage is not real high. Again, he's standing flat-footed under the net, and that's a tough place to be in, like a rebound. This is not where you want to be. You want to be out, you know, out from the basket in order to play it out. Here again it sits on the palm of that right hand. Just a lot of control, support for shooting the basketball. Here's flat-footed. He does have his eyes up, but it's tough. It's tough to shoot when you're underneath the basket. Not an ideal fundamental shot. Here the shooter is attempting to perform or execute the Mike and drill. Ideally, you know, on the left side on the Mike and you want the shooter to step through on the right foot here and pull the left leg up. He's choosing just to stand, stand under the net and just stand and shoot the basketball. He's totally just using his left hand. No little use of the right or the non-shooting hand on this side. I, you know, ideally we want that footwork to lift and elevate around the basket to be able to go up over a defender and then you want the right hand, you know, to help get the ball up to the shot so you could be strong with it as you go up. Here, just very vulnerable position to be in. The ball just sitting on one hand. He's got the right angle here but probably not a lot of control just coming out of the palm of that left hand. Again, not ideal. Two hands on the basketball as we lift the ball up to shoot it. We want to go off this left foot. We don't want to just lean onto the right foot. We want to step through with this left foot, have better timing and rhythm for the mic. Here's the lift. Again, a defender can just knock that out of his hand. The ball is probably wobbling as it comes out. Here it is. See how it's sitting on the palm of his hand? He's just kind of scooping it up. You want that shooting hand behind the ball and the guide hand to help lift it up there. Again, very little use of the footwork and legs for the Mike and drill. Here, he missed the ball, just comes right back down. He doesn't even move his feet to go get the ball. So, not ideal. You know, you've got to... This drill is about footwork and timing and rhythm and flow from side to side. Here, he's just standing and waiting for the ball to come down. He does keep his eyes up. But basically, he's just shooting this lifting hook shot, which is not a real fundamental type of shot. Here, you know, he doesn't even move. You know, execution-wise, the footwork is something he needs to be taught or do without a ball or without a shot. Again, he just stands here. So here, you need to, ideally, you want to step through on the left foot and pull the right knee up. And again, see how he just has the ball sitting on the palm of that right hand. The off-arm is just not being used at all. Again, the ball's in a very vulnerable position here. It's not stable. It's not balanced. It's gonna come out of the fingertips and just move too much and it'll throw off the accuracy of it. It's hard to do. And you know, here, it's just the spacing to shoot is not real well. You can't, it's hard to stand underneath the basket and do the Mike and drill. You", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

As the climber was engaging on making a close grip at the purple block, the climber was also sustaining the green pinch which the climber kept trying to bring the elbow down to stay close to the wall and as well as him creating body positioning that would make him be underneath the purple hold. This was difficult and the climbers right foot has then come out of place making it impossible for the climber to pull on such holds. If the climber was going to do this again it's important that he finds quickly the next foot positioning as this may not be the best area where the climber can sustain the grips for a long time. Since the climber has reached the purple grip, the climber slaps the hold and tries to create friction by leaning on the hold, staying under it and keeping the elbow close to the wall. This is important because the climber is creating friction with an open grip but catches the grip at the corner of the hold. Now that the climber has reached the hold, he needed to release the pressure done by the left toe so that the climber is able to gain position to stay under it and swing him back to apply the right force instead of being away from the hold. As the climber released the left hand to make a placement to match the right hand hold, we can see how the climber's left foot has come off the foot placement. This, if the climber gets to sustain the grip, he will need to apply core pressure to not allow the feet to touch the floor. In this case, the climber will create enough pressure at the grip and has to bring his feet up back into the wall. This would be called cutting feet if it was done with control, but in this case the climber's left foot has slipped off from the wall. Here we can see the climber bringing his right toe to be placed above the left hand initials hold. This one the climber is creating pressure by pushing down on the hold with the right toe and the climber continues to pull the hand upwards towards the climber in a way of the wall in order to sustain pressure. Once the climber gets to apply pressure on the foot and then the climber will be able to release the lift hand grip. As the climber was making his way on the swing out to be underneath the hold where the hand was placed, the climber has lost the center of gravity, this time because he was too far away from the wall. Potentially a lack of pressure on the foot being placed, which was the right foot, and then the left hand grip has given out the moment that the right foot has dropped. This made it impossible for the right hand to stay on the purple hold. Here the climber continues to apply pressure on the grip, this one being the pinch, and is bringing himself close to the wall. To gain height, the climber is pushing down on the right foot as he is extending his leg, which initially he had brought his knee inwards to keep his position right side against the wall, which will help the climber keep closeness when making the reach, which will be efficient for the climber. As we can see, the left leg has gone out into an extension and pointed out. This is called flagging out, which helps the climber stay balanced while pressing on the right foot. As we can see also, the toe is being pressed against the wall, and this is to support the climber having three points of contact on the wall to maintain position once reaching a certain height, and this to stabilize the climber to have more control when reaching the grip. This flag also helps the climber to keep his right side against the wall as he will be pressing on the leg, keeping tension, and driving his hip against the wall and staying in that position. It's important the climber glances down at the feet, especially when switching down on a foot chip, which is a small hold, in order to apply the right pressure when doing the switch of foot placement. In this case, the climber will have to continue to apply pressure at the grips, and that to release some pressure down at the feet. However, the feet will have to continue to have contact with the foot chip so that the climber doesn't slip away from the hold. As we can see, the right foot has come to be positioned onto the hold first, this one being the toe, for the left toe to then be released, which he will have to do by rolling it out of the foot chip. The climber is making some hand gestures with his hands. This will help the climber to visualize the sequence before getting onto the wall, as each hold would pertain for each hand to be held at a certain way, as well as having to have an order for each hand to go over the other. The climber was able to recover getting his feet back in the wall and places them at a high stance. Quickly engaging force on the feet by pressing down the climber was able to bring his squat to an open stance to drive his hips in when making the pull quickly to the next hold. This left hand seems to be a pinch so the climber will need to drive force from the thumb to continue to sustain the grip. In this case, the climber needed to bring his feet up to benefit from moving up the sequence of holds coming ahead. So as we can see, the climber has a match of three limbs in one hold. This one because the climber will be needing to release the right foot out of the hold and instead the climber is bringing the left toe to be placed above the hold. This will help the climber to keep his hips square once releasing the right foot. And once the climber applies pressure on that left toe, then the climber's left hand will be able to come out of place. Here the climber is starting at a two hand hold start. As we can see the top hold, the climber will need to create pressure by pushing on the hold and staying under it as it's on a rail. So the left hand on the other hand is placed under and by the hip of the climber. So past the hip of the climber actually. So this is called an undercling and the climber is placing the fingers underneath the hold and it seems to be like a jug, meaning that it's a positive hold. But in order to sustain that grip, the climber will have to pull it towards him. This type of pulling, this is called a compression. So in order to stay in place, the climber will need to keep the arms extended once placing the feet. The climber will then start the climb until the feet are off the ground.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

However, they would really benefit from dropping that pelvis back so that they're more grounded and they're able to activate the appropriate range of motion for this movement, which I believe should come from kind of this forward and backwards hinge of the upper body instead of this kind of circular motion that they're activating in their chest and shoulders. Overall, they need to bring their pelvis into the conversation of the movement, which would be welcomed by a deeper grounding. As the dancer begins with the basic salsa step, right away they demonstrate that they have an understanding of the movement vocabulary and technique here. They're incorporating their arms in a way that's choreographically appropriate, clear, and appears natural and like they're at ease as they're doing so. They've also got a fair amount of movement through their torso and their pelvis, which is helping to kind of continue to maintain that rhythmic embodiment. And have some nice clarity in their footwork as well. Overall, they demonstrate that they're familiar with the movement technique and able to execute rhythmic embodiment. As the dancer performs this ball change moving backwards into the space, they lose the clarity that they had in their footwork before. They would really benefit from clarifying the ball change of the feet, as well as bending the knees and dropping the pelvis not only back, but also out so that it pulls them in this direction that they're moving behind themselves. They would also benefit from finding some dynamic clarity of the arms here. They've got a fairly clear shape. However, just some refinement of that dynamic would be great. As the dancer performs some quicker movements, they would really benefit from grounding and bending their knees, dropping their pelvis a bit more here, which would help them move more quickly and efficiently in moments where the tempo is a bit quicker. They would also really benefit from grounding to activate a greater range of motion from the top of their head through their spine and down to their pelvis in this body roll, where they're only activating kind of their mid torso, leaving out their pelvis and their head from this body roll, which is really cutting their movement short and overall appears a bit awkward and clunky. They would also benefit from some more clarity in the shaping of the arms here.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

So the climber is bringing the toe in and once the climber turns his knee to come into the wall, then he will be pressing the hold away in order to create pressure. The climber chooses to drop the feet out of the foot placement and to bring his center of gravity to be hanging low to transfer over the weight to the grips. The climber makes a transition of the right foot from being extended out to come at a high foot placement in front of him While continuing to lock off with the right hand close to his chest And is also not only able to sustain his weight with the right hand But also with the left grip that is at this end since he has already dropped the weight onto the grip by extending the arm At this reach of the climber sending the left hand over to the hold, he sustains it as a pinch. Since the climber is sending over the thumb onto the other side, in order to sustain the grip, he must squeeze onto the hold. Immediately after securing the grip, he immediately drops the weight. The climber is only using two places of contact as his areas of support. The left hand sustaining onto the grip with the arms extended while pressing onto the right toe to create pressure to sustain himself in place. The climber has dropped the left foot being on a flag so that the climber can stay steady on his center of gravity being close to the wall as he made the transition of the right hand coming out from the pinch to fully be arched over his head to make the right hand placement over to his left side. Now his right hand is coming into place to a large lip ridges of the hold. The climber making the first move out of the start, he sends the left hand up inside of the hold. This one has a small edge and is sharp so the climber places his fingers behind the edge of the hold. As we can see, his body movement in order to make the reach, he has pushed off on the left foot and has sent the left foot extended due to committing to a dynamic reach. At this view we can see the climber starting at a two hand hold start. The right hand he's sustaining to a block which he will have to create pressure by squeezing onto the sides of the hold. The reason why the climber brings the thumb over to the other side. For the left hand we can see the climber sustaining to a much smaller hold. This one the climber will place the fingertips above the top edge of the hold. Since this is small the climber will have to engage a lot of power onto the top fingers where the knuckles will be sticking out. He will have to bring the palm into the hold in order to keep the hand in place. When the climber makes a series of moves without using the feet and the feet are on space, this is called campusing as he uses momentum and upper body force in order to sustain the holds throughout the moves. The climber must sustain the grips tight even if having the arms extended. This is because the climber will be performing a foot switch. The type of foot switch that the climber is doing is called a magic carpet, where he sends the left toe above the right toe, this one one shoe over the other, and the climber is slightly moving back the right foot, that is the one right now being in contact with the hold. It's important that the climber, when doing this foot switch, he does not lose contact of the foot placement, as it will overcompensate the grips. So the climber, as making a space of smearing the foot back to give space at the front of the toe, he then is able to place the very top edge of the left toe to press into the hold, and as soon as the climber has that type of contact, he will then quickly release the right foot out of its place to then the climber drop the left heel to have a surface of the toe with the hold. The climber once applying pressure into the high foot placement, being in the small foot chip, he releases the left foot from its place and extends the leg. This is called flagging out and it helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place. Now the climber is glancing to a hold of distance, which he will need to commit into a dynamic move and sustain onto the areas of support being the left hand and the right foot placement tightly as he gets to balance the leg to balance the move. We can see how the climber brought the right hand to come into a match at the same hold. Matching is when both of the limbs are in the same hold and he brings the fingers to be placed flat on top of the edge of the hold. Now the climber must continue to sustain the grip by placing weight onto it. The reason why the climber is engaging to a pull up to bring the elbows close to the wall to transfer over the weight to the grips. The climber continues to keep the arms bended while making this right foot placement. He has only used the right foot placement to stabilize himself from swinging and have a slight boost so that the climber can secure making the left hand up to be transitioned to the holder reach. As we can see the climber continues to have the pull up while sustaining onto the grips. This way he is not dropping off his weight yet. If he does do drop the weight, it will be difficult for the climber as he would have to release and then again engage on the arms taking more energy out of the climber. And he said the climber has looked around so that he can make a foot placement in this instance. So he brings the right foot into a high foot placement and once securing the foot then the climber will be able to drop the weight on the grips. It's important to know that when the climber performs campusing, to only do it when there is good holds, as campusing over small holds or holds that are rounded or with small edges will not work as great as the climber will compromise the movement in his climb. We can see the climber dropping his center of gravity away from the wall by continuing to sustain to the grips in the left foot that he just made a placement to. This to bring the right foot into a high foot placement next to his right hand, bringing the foot to be placed inside on top of the foot chip. This one because it's the small hole that the climber had used for his left hand before placing the top edge of the toe to press against the hold. Now the climber must sustain to the grips tightly once he gets to apply force into that toe placement in order to make the next move. The climber had extended the arms before performing this move. So once he was ready, he engaged on a forceful pull-up, pulling both of the grips down in order to gain height to release the right hand from its placement. The climber doing a kick back helps the climber to gain even more height so that he has more time to transition his right hand over to the next hand placement. The climber is chucking up his hands as he's placing his hands inside of a bucket. Where as a big pouch in the climber, in chucking up the hands, will be chucking the palms in order to gain a better grip when sustaining onto the wall, as well as absorbing any sweat that may be coming from his hands. The climber right now is fully extended horizontally so he's sending the left foot that was out on a flag to come into place at the same hold where the right foot is coming to a match. Except that the right foot is placed inside of the hold while he's placing the left toe on the outer side of the hold. This one because it has a hole inside of the hold. Once the climber gets to create pressure onto that left toe coming into place he will be able to release the right foot from the hold. We can see the climber, once creating pressure of the right foot coming into place, he was able to release the left foot. So the climber is able to use it as a flag, which means that he will transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place, and the left leg being extended as a flag will help the climber to maintain balance over the moves. The climber has reached the last hold coming into a match. Now the climber, while matching the hold and sustaining his position, he must demonstrate controlling his stability in order to complete the climb. The climber then is glancing down at the feet and it's important that he always glances down at the feet especially when making a foot switch. The climber right now is holding on tight onto the grip so release some of the pressure down at the feet but the climber needs to continue to create pressure down at the feet to not lose its foot placement. When the climber gets to apply pressure of the left toe onto the hold then he will be able to release the right foot from its place. The climber takes advantage of the momentum to transfer over to the left side of the wall. In this one, the climber had brought the right hand up into a jog and quickly brings the transition of the left hand to the next grip being a pinch hold. As we can see, the climber continues to pick up his weight by tensing on the body and this time picking up the feet. Once the climber gets to secure the grips, he could continue to do one more pull by extending the arm or drop the weight at the positive grips that he's at. The climb will start once the climber gets to place the feet onto the wall and is no longer standing on the mat. This is a step up start. So the climber once places the feet onto the wall, he will be able to raise the hips by pressing on the feet and transferring over the weight to the grips by leaning back. We can see how the climber continuously throughout a series of moves have kept the left leg extended. This is called flagging out and helps the climber to transfer over the weight to the highest foot being in place, as well as keeping his side towards the wall when making the reach. In this case, it's important that the climber keeps his left side towards the wall as it assures the climber to bring his center of gravity close. Dropping the feet can also help the climber to maintain balance and stability over the performance of moves. The claim of making some hand gestures is for him to visualize the movements he must perform when on the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I would encourage this dancer to really think about head placement and how can they incorporate their head and neck. They're doing a wonderful job of rotating their shoulders forward, up, and back and not looking at the ground, but thinking about creative ways to incorporate and show engagement in the head shows embodiment from head to toe even in basic choreography.

The dancer continues to look to the side of the room. It's very important, especially for when she's doing a turn or completing this revolution, that she looks forward so that she doesn't get dizzy and that she completes this change in direction neatly. Right now, she's leaving her shoulders open to the side of the room. Her hips are open also to the side of the room. And instead, all this should be facing directly to the front where the black curtain is facing in front of her. The dancers focus is off. She keeps looking to the side of the room Towards the mirror where perhaps the dancer Dancers choreographer teacher is standing for clues to the sequence. We see someone here might be also dancing with her But instead the dancer really needs to be looking straightforward This is changing her spine right now her cervical spine or her neck is turned to the side meanwhile It's also opening up her shoulders and her chest a bit to the side and her shoulders should be both squared off To the front of the room her chest should be completely straight straight to the front of the room this just allows the possibility of also her hips turning to the side and just Changing the alignment of her spine The dancer now is stepping underneath herself and not traveling at all. She's reaching the end of the routine but she doesn't gain speed or traction or energy. She's just stepping in place. This seems very casual, nonchalant. She really should be executing this basic salsa steps, forward and backwards and back to the center. So she ends the routine strongly. Right now she's just giving up and dissipating her energy. The dancer once again forgets the sequence, so now she's stepping in place instead of doing the next salsa steps, which should be a box step around in a square. Again, the dancer is looking towards the side of the room because this set of dance steps is about to end and she's about to go into a different set of dance steps and she's looking for a clue as to what that next set is. The dancer really needs to memorize this routine herself so that she's not relying on looking at someone else, especially because it's changing the alignment of her body and her spine. So not only is it harming her execution of the steps because she doesn't know what they are, but it's also further harming the execution, not only from forgetting them, but also in how she's performing them since her spine is misaligned. The dancer completes the wrong step when she begins. She is supposed to be stepping twice in place before sliding outward horizontally either to her right or her left, but instead she begins with a basic salsa step forward. So this is a mistake she made in terms of the sequence and shows that perhaps she doesn't have the routine memorized as well as she should. The dancer alternates arm position. At first she has her arm bent with her wrist flicked. Now she's having her arms straight so she should just be consistent in which arm position she's choosing. Either is fine but she's going back and forth and especially since she doesn't have the choreography memorized as much as she could, she would be helping herself if she kept her arm positions consistent so that she wouldn't confuse herself even further than she is already. Her dancer doesn't travel equidistant forward and back. She's taking larger steps forward and returning to the center And then the smaller steps backwards, but her forward steps and her backwards steps should be equidistant It shouldn't be favored in one direction over the other The dancer does not extend her arms as much as she can She's bringing her arms out to her side horizontally right and left alternating And she's bending her arms To her side, however, she doesn't actually do this to her full capacity She doesn't raise her arms high enough. Her arms should be higher and they going between straight and bent which is fine But she doesn't actually execute this right now Her arms are very low and they don't reach the full height. They should be swung to her side and also upward", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I think she definitely could have bent this right knee a bit more, really extend this leg out, and then with her left arm really drag it all the way down. She didn't really get as low as she could have, so just really fulfilling that full movement range of motion in the arm. So overall, this was definitely a really great job. Not really any notes of corrections. All of her movements look great. She stayed on her, on the balls of her feet, kept her knees bent, kept the rhythm, had a little personality in there. So just really overall, nice job, nice example for this intermediate salsa. So here, nice smile on her face, a little personality, the arm reaching out. With her legs, she's just stepping side to side, nice space between her legs. Her knees are bent, and as she steps out, she is kind of rolling her body back and forth throughout the steps. So really nice flow and moving to the rhythm. So from the beginning the dancer starts really strong with all of her steps. They are all accurate. She has a really nice even flow throughout her body. Her knees are bent nicely and she's able to incorporate her upper body and arms really well. So nice job starting off. So a really nice turn. She was definitely spotting with her head, her head whipped around quickly to get her fully around and it was a really nice clean turn. So here, when she did the head roll, that was nice because her head dropped all the way down past her shoulders. The arm reach up right before this pause could have extended for about a second longer, really holding that note out and then moving into the next step. So up to here, again, really great job, great use of the arms, extending them out, keeping everything nice and strong, and also stepping and dancing to the correct beats.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Their arms kind of stay just in this natural position down to their sides. Their torso stays fairly erect and stiff from the shoulders down through the pelvis, and they don't really engage the head in any meaningful way, which shows that they really are lacking an understanding of the movement vocabulary and really focused on the footworks and the mechanics of what's happening in the lower body in particular. As the dancer performs a series of rock steps and triple steps, this time moving forwards and backwards in the space, she really significantly falls off the rhythm here and is really lacking a connection to the music. She would benefit from a deeper understanding of both the movement vocabulary and the music itself. Perhaps this could be enhanced through a deeper bending of the knees, a dropping back of the pelvis, and deeper incorporation of the upper body in general, as well as just some additional rehearsal or practice prior to this performance. As the dancer performs a series of rock steps and triple steps, she struggles to stay connected to the rhythm and embody the rhythm in any meaningful way. Particularly in her footwork, she's able to maintain the speed needed to keep up with the music. She would benefit from bending her knees more and dropping her pelvis back so that she's more grounded and able to activate a greater range of motion in her body. She also would benefit from incorporating her arms with more clarity. Right now they're just kind of swaying and sticking out naturally from the sides of her shoulders, which I feel is keeping her from being able to embody the rhythm more deeply. And she's got a fairly stiff shoulders, spine, and pelvis, which is keeping her in this very upright position and holding her back from being able to move at the tempo required for this movement. As a dancer appears to be performing a rock step to the front, they're missing a really key portion of the rock step which is this exchange of weight. As you can see here, they're using their left leg to step out in front of them. However, they're not placing their foot completely on the ground and transferring the weight from the back foot to the front foot which is integral to performing the rock step here and also staying on the rhythm of the music by adding this kind of swing into the movement. Here they would really benefit from just really stepping down on that working leg, bending deeply through the knees as well as a deeper engagement of the pelvis in this movement, dropping the pelvis back and remaining kind of low and grounded to the floor so that they're able to transfer their weight quickly and efficiently with clarity while remaining connected to the rhythm. The dancer demonstrates that she's able to remember and perform choreography here, however she's missing a really important part of the rock step and the triple step, which is the actual swing of the movement. She's performing everything on one beat, performing the rock step and the triple step on the same count, same beat, without any specific movement dynamics or swinging of the timing or the rhythm. Here she would just benefit from, in general, understanding how to embody the rhythm more deeply and how to connect her movements to the rhythm. So rather than performing everything on a one, two, three, four count, she would instead perform the rock step on a one, two, three, and four, five, and six, seven, eight. So instead of performing everything on the downbeat, she would be able to find more intricacy within the embodiment of the rhythm, which in general just takes practice and more familiarity with both the movement vocabulary and the music.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Now the climber does this by landing on the feet, having a loose body and at the same time keeping the arms in. Once the climber was going to make the impact and rolls backwards to then transfer the impact from the feet, squatting down and letting the feet fall up towards him and letting the climber roll on their spine. At this moment the climber kept their hands in and then stopped from rolling by sending the palms down onto the mat. Here the climber failed to reach up to the next hold. This one, the climber was already crunched up and has made a placement with the highest foot. Now the climber needed to step up 100% onto the right foot and failed to place all of the weight over to transfer it onto the stand as the climber needed to rock their hips to the high stance. This one, the climber would have to bring their hips in the moment that they were getting themselves pulled in and at the same time had to bring and rock their hips over to the highest foot. Once sending their weight to the right side and the climber would have to press harder on the foot to then go up for the reach and keep leverage to sustain the weight of the climber and drive the climber up on the dynamic move. Here we can see the climber is going up for the next move in which the climber will need to release the right hand. This one due to being positioned the lowest and the assumption of the right hand going up is because the climber has twisted the right side to be facing the wall. Now the climber to support this twist has brought their right foot into a high position and move up the knee to go inwards pointing out left. Now this is important that the climber keeps the right side towards the wall to support the reach as the climber will also need to bring their center of gravity close to the wall which is on the core or the hips. To support this twist that the climber has sent their left leg onto an extension and has dropped the foot. This one the foot will be supporting to by tapping the wall to keep the twist of the climber to stay right side in. Here the climber has engaged into a pull-up quickly to move to the left hold once the right foot was placed down below. The right foot in this instance is not in any foot chip and instead is pushing against the wall. This one so that the climber can bring his hips close to the left side as he steps up on the higher foot. Once the climber got to move their body of their hips close and rocked on top of the highest foot, once the climber was to gain stability, you could have let go of the right hand to make the reach above. Here the climber has dropped the left leg, leaving the foot not in position and instead is used only to keep the climber with balance as he would need to bring the right hip over the highest stance, being the right foot. This one will need to have the climber press most of the percentage on the leverage as the climber will need to engage power by leaning back and when the climber is ready, it's doing a pull up position that is dynamically and the climber will fully be standing up onto that right foot when going for the reach. Here we can see the climber has swapped his feet down below. This one by again doing a hop of the toe, of replacing the right toe with the left toe onto the foot chip and quickly has moved the right foot at a higher stance, placing the front of the toe box onto an edge. Now as we can see while the climber is doing the switch of feet into a new position, we can see how the climber is engaging the grip above. This one is taking the most pressure as he needs to release pressure down below for the switch as long as well as supported with the left hand that's keeping him close. But it's important that the climber is engaging mostly the grip and does not try to engage onto a pull-up position as it's important that the climber needs to later on save the energy when engaging for big moves. So he keeps the arm extended as much as possible during this switch swap of feet and placement. Here the climber is chalking up his hands. Doing this helps the climber have a better grip when on the wall as well as absorbing any sweat coming from his hands. Here we can see the climber had moved up to the next hold as static as possible. So in this case the climber didn't need to make an extension for a jump but instead needed to stay in position which was done by the climber engaging the forearm and also keeping the grip tight. While in that meanwhile when the climber was going for their reach he really needed to keep the right side towards the wall which was supported by pushing down on the left foot also keeping balance for the climber when transferring weight supported by the right foot. Here the climber looks down below to his feet. It's important that the climber does this carefully at the same time, engaging more the grips above. This so that the climber can take more of the weight and take off the pressure from the feet in order to make the foot swap. Now this type of foot swap that the climber is doing is the foot hops in which the left foot is being released and then the right foot is taking place where the left foot was. Here the climbers are starting at a one-hold start, meaning that both hands are going to be placed in the same hold. When both hands are in the same hold, this is called matching. And in this type of hold that the climbers are starting at, it's a pinch that is placed in a horizontal. So the climber must stay under it in order to create more pressure from the top and help with the pinch to bring the climber forward with the thumbs. Now the climber will start until both of the feet are off the ground and on the wall. Coming off from the mat completely, then the climber will start.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The second finger is on the second fret and then this finger is behind it and then this pinky is two frets higher and then that first finger is on the first fret. So, this is a chord shape that requires a bit of flexibility and the ability to stretch the fingers. He's, it also helps that he's keeping his thumb relaxed right here opposite his second finger and so, you can see his fingers are still curved and he's still getting a really clear sound. So, this is kind of a harder chord shape but he's making it work really well. Right here the guitarist is playing the harmonics on the guitar. So this is a spot on the guitar where you don't have to actually push down the string all the way. So he's just lightly touching the string while he plucks it and it creates this very kind of spacey, ethereal sound. And he's doing it, he got to that spot accurately with his finger in the right spot, the shift of the hand was very smooth and the harmonics sound really clear and really beautiful. His right hand finger pattern is changing a little bit between some of these chords and he's doing it with a consistent tempo, a consistent speed and the notes are very evenly played and each note rings out really clearly. As the music grows in intensity, they are speeding up the music just a little bit by executing their finger pattern with the right hand faster. So this is a speeding up, really adds intensity to the music, and it's done with a lot of control with his fingers, so that was very well done. The guitarist then had to shift their hand all the way down the fingerboard to this higher position and they did it with a ton of precision so they got to the right notes in the correct spot with a lot of precision and the movement was very smooth so that was very well done. The guitarist had to switch to a different finger pattern here or a different chord, and they did this very smoothly without much hiccup between one chord from the next chord because they placed their fingers down on those frets at the right time. So the timing and the changing between chords was very smooth. This finger right here, the ring finger, had just a moment where it wasn't pressed down hard enough on the fret, so there's a little bit of a dull sound right there for just a split second, but that's just because there wasn't enough weight on the fret. However, he fixed it pretty quickly and it was a very small little mistake. The guitarist had their finger in the wrong spot for just a moment, but then they fixed it really quickly. So I think that they had just a slight hiccup between chord changes with just one of the fingers. As they finished this musical phrase, they slowed down their finger picking a little bit, just to draw attention to the end of that section of the music. And so that was very musically done and very musically mature. The guitarist has a curved hand shape and all the knuckles are bent and they're using enough weight on each string to get a really nice clear sound. Just now he executed a couple of hammer-ons on guitar, which is when you pluck the note and then you have one finger down and then you put down another finger while the string is still vibrating. And he did many of those in rapid succession with a lot of clarity. This barred chord shape here, he's using his first finger to push down all of the strings on that fret right there, while also using his ring finger right here to pluck another string. I believe he's using his second finger to give the first finger just a little bit extra strength. And the barred chord sounds very clear. He has a good amount of pressure on the string to make it sound clear. The guitar player is using a little bit of vibrato with this finger and they're wiggling it back and forth to warm up the sound and this creates a more beautiful, more warm sound by wiggling the finger back and forth on this higher note, also adding emphasis to this part of the harmony change. So this is a very musical decision and it sounds really nice. The guitar player had to move their thumb along with the rest of the hand back to get to that lower chord. And so they did that really smoothly without much tension in their hand and then their thumb. So that was a really smooth change between chords. In the right hand, they are using a thumb with a long fingernail to pluck the bass note, and then the other fingers are strumming notes in a strumming pattern. The guitarist is doing this with a lot of precision because every note is really clear and sounds very resonant.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Now he's cut his cucumber in half lengthwise and placed the one half of the cucumber down on the flat side. Now he's cut his cucumber in half horizontally so he's got two ends. He's using the cleaver to remove the tips off the ends of the cucumber. And he places the second half down just beside that so they're parallel and begins cutting at an angle through these. His fingers are tucked nicely, his hands are placed well for safety, and using an angle he'll get sort of a half circle but it'll be a little bit elongated. He makes nice light strokes. He's got a sharp implement which is always helpful. He's not tearing his cucumber apart. He holds his cucumber and turns it as he goes. This probably has a combination of spices and flavorings in addition to a vinegar and oil, which is the standard makeup of a dressing, and that'll give great mouthfeel, a little bit of a heightened quality to the flavors, and then just add another level of flavors, whatever the profile is of the dressing, to his cucumber salad. Here he's grabbing some kind of dressing, a pre-made dressing from his refrigerator. And now adding some fresh ground black pepper. Both play well together and both add a little hint of something else. The salt will draw liquid out of both the cucumbers and tomato. It'll also enhance the flavor. It sits on the tongue very specifically to bring out the flavors. And then the pepper will add a little zing. Freshly ground is the best way because the oils are released right before it hits the dish. And you'll get just like an earthy undertone. He's over the sink, which is great because it catches his extra less cleanup, especially if he has a disposal. You can tell his knife is sharp. It's going through these very easily without having any issues. When you have round objects like this, you wanna make sure that you have a sharp knife because you don't wanna have an incident where the knife rolls off of the tomato and then cuts you. So he's grabbed a cucumber from a bag. He makes great contact with his cutting board and his knife makes clean cuts through so he doesn't have any straggling hanging cuts. It looks as if he's going to repeat that process with this half as he's starting to do the peeling now. He's taking a peeler and now he's peeling his one half of the cucumber. He's grating some salt into his mixture. And he throws those away. And here he's got chopsticks he's using to stir his mixture, making sure it's evenly coated with his dressing and his salt pepper.

So he has right foot, left foot, right foot, right hand, left foot. So he's opted to pose, but he could kind of twist in, you know, flag this foot out even further, his right foot. But it just seems like he's kind of placing his feet on the holds. He's not cutting his feet, but he's just kind of placing the feet and then pulling through his arms. So now we can see he chooses not to do the backflag. Instead he matches feet onto this and flags the left foot out. He could have just stuck the left foot there, backflag the left foot and saved himself from having to make a foot swap. He's still pretty bent in with the arms. So overall I think he's kind of climbing more with his upper body and not utilizing his feet as well. And now with this, you can do the same thing that he was doing before. So now he's done the foot swap. He could bring this knee up and over. So he's kind of pulling straight down through that foot or pushing straight down and then aggressively flag the left foot out and kind of twist his torso. Twist his torso into his arm a little bit, into his forearm and bicep. And really twist and bring that right hip into the wall and kind of sit on top of that hold. So he kind of starts the row with his arms locked off a little bit. His legs are a little bit bunched, so I think what he could have done is taken a little bit more pressure to his left foot and tried to get his left knee a little bit over top, so that way he's kind of applying his force straight through that hold. Then kind of sink his hips down, bring this right foot a little bit more to the left as well, so that way he can kind of straighten these arms out and kind of drive through the feet. It seems like he kind of just pulls a little too hard with his arms and causes his feet to rip off, cutting his feet and they hit the ground and he's off the route. But instead he kind of relies on the arms, his hips and feet really don't change position as he grabs this next right hand hold. He kind of just engages more with that left arm, so he's pretty locked off here. So he's really climbing heavily with his upper body and not really driving through his lower body. You can see even as he makes his first move, he's kind of really making it from his arms. His leg looks appears to be in the same position with his knee kind of sticking out. So if he didn't adjust the knee in the first move, he could adjust the knee and bring it to the left over more and really sink down through that foot. Maybe driving through that foot, get his weight over that foot. And that could kind of let him go into a backflip and move the right foot.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

So as she's doing this we can kind of see that she's allowing herself to be in a straight arm position initially right here. And this is kind of a good thing by allowing herself to hang over to the right. This is able to allow her to transfer her body weight over to the left and then kind of push herself up in the direction that she needs to go. However what I'm noticing is that as she's kind of swinging herself from left to right in this starting position here, she's hanging in a straight arm position on the far right and then as she starts going to the left she naturally just starts pulling her body in with her upper body. So this is kind of a reverse way that she wants to think. And instead I would actually encourage the clamber to really focus on keeping her arms straight from left to right and focusing on how much her body is transitioning over that left foot because that left foot is going to be the biggest thing that can help her to get up to this yellow hold that she's aiming for. And so here we can see that as the climber is reaching out for that left hand hold that she's aiming for we can see That what her left leg is doing is that her knee is pointed straight in into the wall And so as that happens that actually helps to push her hip away from the wall And so when her hip is getting pulled away from the wall It actually makes the distance that her left hand has to travel a little bit further And it also doesn't allow her to really transfer her body weight over that left foot Which forces her to have to rely on how much she's pulling with her right arm So this does make the movement a little bit harder for her to complete", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Like just playing slow and the best you can. It proceeds to get faster here to make it even more challenging for them to get that right hand to sync up. Yeah, this first finger has some serious collapsing struggles. Again, with a too fast tempo for what she's capable of reading and playing at the same time. Yeah, more buckling here with the fingers. Good sitting position from what I can tell. The chair's not high enough for the stand itself is too tall. You can see that the arms need to come up to the fingerboard. Collapsed finger here as well. And the tempo is not as consistent as it could be when playing all the way at the bottom of the scale in this range and then has the chords in the right hand. I think the fingers are just a little long. They just seem like they're playing really far away. And if you think about the hand here as like home base for like a tree trunk, and then you've got the branches that come out. The further away the branches are, the larger the base needs to be or else it'll crack and fall off. And we don't get to increase this energy here. We don't get to increase that baseline there. And so to have those fingers so far away creates a long lever arm, which makes it really difficult to push down those keys with efficiency without getting tired. And so her whole hand is just not playing the instrument with the best leverage that she could possibly have. And pulling those fingers in and that palm rounded would be really, really helpful for her to loosen up this hand and play with a clear, more weighted sound. That takes less energy. Yeah, just place the song too fast. Like, put on a metronome, play slower. Really time those hands together. Having to change the tempo all the time in order to make it feel like you're actually playing a tune, just ill-advised, slow down the tempo here so that you can really get a good sync and coordination between each hand.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

Would love maybe to see his feet a little further apart. He's a little under the basket, but he's ready.

Great lift, footwork, pushing off that left foot, right knee up. Here you can see he's so high up on the backboard. He's a tall guy, but soft touch, the balls coming off the pads of the fingers, high on that square. Nice job. Again, beautiful step here with the left foot, followed by the right. He brings that guide hand on the side, being really strong with it here. He doesn't have to look at it. Eyes and head are up, looking at where he wants to go in the target. Again, beautiful look here of the extension. Look at that right knee and hip lift, arm bar, eyes and head are up. Beautiful extension of the ball here. Again, great lift, arm bars up, eyes and head are up, beautiful extension, the ball leaves the fingertips. High on the glass. Love how he begins this drill with a stepping of the right foot. He steps on that right foot and he doesn't even dribble it. He's got a right foot plant, balls in two hands, eyes and head are up. Again, great lift, push off here. He's got some space and air under there as he lifts. Arm bar, eyes and head up, beautiful extension of the right shooting arm. Again, nice step, nice, covers a lot of space here with no dribble. You don't need a dribble, but going to push off that left foot, great distance covered here. He's, I mean, he's got long legs. He's going to bring that right leg behind. He's got two hands on the ball. You know, it is a little low, but he, but because he's got two hands on the ball, he's being very strong with it. You know, it'd be hard for maybe a defender to get it if he's got two hands on it. But look how he's looking to where he's going. He's not looking down. He's not looking elsewhere. He's looking at the basket. Again, look how when he finishes, both shoulders are square to the backboard. He's not turned one way or the other, but his body is in line facing the basket. And both his feet are elevating. Great lift here. The ball's touching the top of that square, has a really good chance of going in. Again, great lift, arm bar comes off as he releases it. But again, look at how his fingers are spread. That's really good. The ball comes off those pads of those fingers. Nice, soft touch. Beautiful execution here of the reverse layup. Steps on that left foot, raises that right leg and knee high. He had two hands on the ball, but you could see that guide hand come off as he lifts the ball or gets ready to shoot the ball with his right hand. Eyes and head are up. Beautiful spacing here in relation to the backboard. Textbook here, beautiful extension, push off, lift of that right knee, arm bar up to protect the ball from a defender. Beautiful lift here of the shooting arm and head. Again, beautiful footwork, push-off, extension, arm bar, eyes and head up on the target, great hand placement. The ball, I mean he's got his hand kind of on the side, but he's got such great elevation height that's okay. Again, really great pulling of the right leg and knee up. Push off of that left foot, extended, all coming off the balls of your feet. Raising those hips. Love that his arm bar is here. You want that there, in case there's a defender, you've got your body between the defender and the ball. So that defender would have to come across your body to try to block it. Therefore, you may draw a foul, or the defender doesn't get to the ball at all. Here is a great look of how he's got both hands on the ball. No dribble, but going off the left, pulling the right, he raises the ball for the shot with both hands, with his right hand behind the ball, that guide hand is there on the left, just to help get it up there, to help keep it supported, to protect it. That's a strong, aggressive move. The next step would be on his left foot. So right foot, left foot, pull the right leg up, two hands on the ball, that guide hand, non left hand shooting hand is on the side. It helps to lift it. His eyes and head are up. Very strong athletic example of a reverse layup. Again, great lift and elevation off the ground. Good extension of the body.

Right now the climber is overcompensating the grips as he is engaging the core to sustain the swing. Here the climber is glancing over to the grip and as he's doing this he's going by feel bringing the left toe into place. This one he makes a match where the limbs on that same initial hold on the undercling has been and in order to release the right foot he must apply pressure on the left toe coming into place. Now that the climber is positioned, we can see how the climber needs to continually apply pressure onto both of the grips. In the top grip, the climber is leaning on the hold in order to apply pressure. For the undercling, the climber will need to pull the hold towards him. In this case, the climber is making the foot placement at the wall. The left foot is on the foot chip and the climb will start until the climber's right foot is off the ground. If the climber was going to attempt this climb again, he needs to make sure that he minimizes the amount of transitions or moves in the wall. In this case, for him it was a waste of time when he decided to do the original foot placement when he had already spent time doing a foot switch. This took away from the climber having energy on the upper body as he was engaging on a close pull up when making the foot switch. Once he was on the purple grip, we can see how the climber's left toe has slipped out of the hold. It's important that the climber once had made the reach that he applies that pressure that he had before coming off from the wall, but also maintains pressure at the toe placement so that the climber doesn't swing out of the wall. Here the climber makes the reach up to the block and in this one he has to keep an open-handed and brings the grip to come into closure at the corner of the block. Now it's important that the climber brings the outer side of the hand to come and meet with the wall so that the climber is able to get more surface onto the grip. In this case the climber needs to also once applying pressure he needs to apply pressure that is accurate to sustain the grip by leaning on the hold. In this case when the climber was going for the next move being the purple block he needed to keep his right side towards the wall. He does this by keeping the right leg extended going on a flag and this helps the climber to have balance and a civility when going for the reach. Having the leg extended helps the climber keep his right side towards the wall as he would need to keep his center of gravity close to the wall to make it easy when the climber brings the upper grip onto a placement. It's important that the climber glances down at the feet to make sure that he does an accurate foot placement. In this case, the climber brings the right foot to come into place before the left foot is being released. This one, the climber has to tip toe on the hold in order to smear out and make the placement of the toe having friction against the hold before he releases the foot. That way he avoids from peeling off the wall. And at this moment to make the foot transition, he must pull tighter on the grips to release some of the pressure down at the feet. Here we can see the climber shaking his hands. This he does because it will help release any tension that may be build up in the hands as well as warming up the hands before going to climb. The climber was able to make the reach out with the left hand to a pinch, meaning that the climber places the thumb on the other side while the fingers are placed on the opposite side so that the climber is able to pinch onto the hold to clamp the grip. The climber now lays pressure on the hold while securing the grip by leaning back and as we can see the climber has sent his right leg to a higher stance in order to make the reach when transitioning the left hand from the undercling to the pinch hold. The climber is bringing his right toe to come into place at the same hold. When both of the limbs are in the same hold, this is called matching and the climber will have to engage pressure on the toe once being placed on top of the hold by pushing down while the climber continuously pulls on the undercling hold. Now when the climber releases the left foot, he will need to bring it into a high placement in order to release the left hand from the hold. The climber is approaching the wall and there is a two hand hold start. Both of the holds are different. The right hand has a bigger hold and seems to be a jug as the climber is able to place the hand at the edge of the lip and wraps the fingers behind the edge. In the left hand, we can see how the climber is placing the hand, copped onto the edge of the hold. This is a jug that is upside down and the type of grip that the climber is applying is by sliding the fingers behind the lips of the hold. In order to activate the gripping power, the climber will need to pull the grip towards him.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

His arms are nice and relaxed with tension. So he does move really well. He does manage to get both his hands on the hold, just is not able to hold the swing. Yeah, and so as he kind of does this he's you can see him kind of moving left to right So his goal is to kind of move Get his weight to the right foot and over the right foot so that we can kind of spring up Go for this a green hold And it looks like he's doing everything correct to me. He's got Really solid right hand on the it as the left hand is kind of reaching up to grab it He's just unable to hold the swings. I think this is where he just needs To get a little bit more vertical on it or just get there a little faster.

The way that the climber has placed both hands matching the hold are the left hand when it went up at first had the fingers slide into a pocket and because this is a triangle or shape hold there was a hole in there where the fingers slid in and there is an edge so the climber must be pulling himself in to the wall by bending the elbow and creating resistance for the grip as well as supported by the thumb that is on the top edge of the hold. Quickly the climber once has fully stepped on the left foot and keeps the leg extended for the stance. The climber then moves quickly to send the right hand up on the hold. This one being held from the top and the thumb over to where the entry of that pocket is on the hold. The climber has reached the top and must hold it for about 3 seconds before letting go and this is when the climber has achieved the problem. the climber was able to grab on to the top hold. This is a jug, so it's a very positive and promising hold to hold on to. But in order to get there, the climber first tried sending the right leg to a higher stance. Knowing to do that was compromising the grips that the climber was holding on tight before, which was right hand on the pinch and the left hand on what seems to be like a nub, where the hold is shallow and the climber brings the nub at the top ball of the palm and presses into the hold by placing the fingertips right between the wall and where the hold ends towards the wall. So there's a small indent down into the wall and that's where the climber digs in the fingertips to sustain the hold. Now, in order to sustain the hold, the climber has to pull forcefully on it. To create pressure on the grip. Same stance with the pinch and it's much more comfortable if the climber was leaning down on it. Same thing with the nub. Reason why the climber then chose to bring the right foot down and keeping the leg extended, that is called flagging in. So the climber, instead of flagging out to like control balance, this is a different type of balance, but it drives the center of gravity down. By doing this, the climber also applies more force to the left toe, which is already being in place and keeps his hips square for the climber tend to gain leverage by stepping up on the left foot, keeping the knee out. This helps also the climber to keep the right hip into the wall when dropping the right foot, which helps support the climbers staying close right side against the wall to help the reach. Here in order for the climber to achieve the highest grip on the pinch, the pinch is when the climber sends the fingers onto one side and the thumb onto the other to create a clamping motion to secure the grip. Since the pinch is vertical, the climber must apply pressure and friction by leaning on the hold. Now, the climber in order to also gain that height needed to step up on the highest foot and that foot was the left foot. In order to the climber gain leverage, couldn't go necessarily straight up from having the foot placement out left. So the climber needed to rock his hips over to the left side to create a stance that would be secured by applying that pressure on the toe. And then has, in order to bring himself over to the left side, the climber is also engaging the grip by making a pull down motion and keeping the elbow close to the body. At that instance, since the climber is transferring the weight from the lower foot to the highest foot, the right foot has already lost contact with the wall and instead is keeping the leg straight down to help the climber let drive his center of gravity out left and also to keep the right side of the hip towards the wall, which will help the climber when engaging at the reach on the right hand. One thing to note, not miss, is that the climber here was standing on the feet both but keeping a low stance kind of like in a squat even though having this position but tries to bring the left shoulder towards the wall. This to help the climber have a closer reach when letting go of the left hand so he can move that hand quickly while still looking at it to make a precise throw of his hand right onto the grid. Here, the climber has made it to the top hold. How the climber got there was first, the climber has moved the left hand through a series of moves, meaning at first was down in the placement by the hip, then was fully standing on his right foot. Quickly, after he got himself pulled in and shifted the weight over to the left foot, the climber then was holding on to the small edge and quickly had bumped up to the left to the top hold. This one, at that time, the right foot has come off from the hold down below and instead, the foot is helping with the leverage of the climber by pressing against the wall and also pushing the toe downwards, this to create some friction to assist the climber with the reach, even if the left foot is the one where the climber has shifted his weight in order to gain reach. Once the climber has reached the top and places the hands matching the hold for about 3 seconds, then the climber has finished the problem. Here the climber had to step up on the right foot while holding on to the left hand in order to establish the first position on the wall. This one to locate the right hand onto the sloper. Slopers are known to be held with the palm open and fingers spread out or cupped in. This the climber then for the right hand specifically needs to then create pressure on the hand due to needing to create friction since it's an open palm. And he does this by keeping the weight of the body on the grip above. Now the left hand that is being placed is a two hand hold start and the left hand we can see how he's comfortably leaning on it and has the grip with the fingers sliding behind the hold. This is called a jug. So far up to this point the climber has been going up a sequence on the pattern of alternative movement of hands and feet. Now in this case the climber in this moment is feeling is stuck meaning that now the handhold is too low and is close past his waist. This makes it difficult for the climber to hold on to especially because he has the left foot on a high placement and the leg is on the way. The climber in this time needs to forcefully be pushing down on the right foot and find a way to stabilize by edging his inner toe area into the wall like digging into it and tries to keep himself close by keeping the arm bended on the right hand. The type of hold of the climber when out left hand is a small chip. This is shaped with a small edge and almost gripped as a crimp but the thumb is slid onto the side to support the pinch. Now the climber is holding to it tightly but before this the climber was struggling down below with placing the foot the right position. This is potentially because the climber wasn't necessarily stepping on the toe but somewhere along the toe box on the inner area of the sole. In this case it's important that the climber can keep a right position for the foot as it's the one sustaining most of the weight of the climber when transferring on any of the points of contact on the wall. Here the climber has brought their left leg up. This one so that the climber can make a placement with the toe on the foot chip. The left leg was before extended out and it was used to for the climber to create balance when applying all of the pressure onto the highest foot which was before the right toe. As the climber needed to create pressure for the right hand grip.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And for the accuracy, for the ball to go in the basket, we've got to get this non-left-hand non-shooting hand out of the shot. Here's the shot. Same thing here. You got to take this non-shooting hand out of the shot. Good extension here of the legs. We want more power, more elevation, more lift. And you get that from your preparation when you're receiving the pass. He does a really nice job here. I do like this about his shot. Sealy holds his follow-through. Holds, extends that arm out there, flex that wrist till it hits rim. Nice job there. And then he takes a dribble, and that's fine if it's a free throw, but I don't think this is a free throw. And you don't have time to take this dribble. He's looking at it, so his eyes came off his target. So let's take away that dribble. Again, he catches it. Again, if this is a free throw, this is fine, but you've got to be quicker. You know, if you don't have time to pause and shoot it, or you're gonna be defended and guarded and not be able to get your shot off. As a right-hand shooter, I love to have this right foot a little bit out in front. I love his knee bends. He's starting to sit here a little bit, which is good. But see, you can barely see it here, but see how both hands are on the each side of the ball? We need this right hand to get behind the basketball. This is good here. And he's looking up, which is good. We want to keep our eye on the target. Does again a great job of that follow-through, little knee bend here, nice feet are apart. This guide hand, I would keep it up. He drops it back. Maybe just keep it up here in front of you a little bit. Here's the shot. Again, see very little elevation here. That guide hand is in the shot way too much. We want to get that guide hand out, but he's got the right idea with the right shooting arm. But he's basically shooting it with two hands. We want to shoot with one hand. Good extension here of the body. Just need more explosiveness, more lift. Here's the shot. In fact, this is really nice. Maybe get the elbow in a tad, but look how his fingers are nice and spread. And the guide hand comes off, but I think what it's done, it's kind of touched the ball to cause it maybe to spin out. In fact, you know, this is much better here, because I can tell the guide hand is not on the ball. I just want it to stay still. Again, I think he would get more power and explosiveness if he would utilize his legs. Here the shooter is shooting a fifteen footer. In this egocentric view you can see he's right handed and you know the guide hand, the left hand is in the shot way too much. He's kind of followed through or snaps the wrist of both hands. You know ideally you want to shoot with one hand which I think he's right handed so let's use that hand let's get the guide hand out of the shot and the palm of that guide hand should just be kind of facing inward just really soft not really doing anything and also on his shot he's really not getting off the ground he's not really utilizing his lower body if you will to get the shot up. So we'd love to see more lift, elevation, use of the legs here and let's get that guide hand out of the shot. The shooting arm looks pretty good my suggestion is maybe bring that right elbow in a little bit. Again, this is the release. He's got pretty good arc on the ball here. This is really nice. Good follow-through. But look at our guide hand. So important. This arm, it just wants to help guide it up there. It really does nothing beyond that. Again, let's explode. Let's lift. He does a good job of extending his hips here. Here's the shot. Again, too much of the non-shooting hand in the basketball. I mean, I can tell he's right-handed. We got to get this non-shooting hand out of the shot. Let's move the right elbow in under the ball. Good extension here of the hips. Again, we need more lift and elevation. Again, he's waiting on this pass. Ideally, for my expert opinion, let's drop our hips, bend our knees, let's get our feet moving and step in and meet this pass. Go get it. It's so that it helps you use your legs and explode up. Again, here's the hands. Again, let's backstop it with our shooting hand. Let's really bend our hips here and get low. Again, you know, I like how he's going on his toes, but I'd like to see him get up off the ground here, good extension. Let's get this shooting elbow in more in line with the basketball, but he does a good job with, you know, breaking that wrist and snapping the fingers. We need to get this guide hand in here, and it basically does nothing. Here, again, on the shot, very little elevation and lift because he's not really using his body. You can see that guide hand, how it's in the shot. And what happens with that is just it takes away the backspin that you want, the rotation you want, the spin you want as the ball makes its way to the basket. He does break the wrist of his right shooting hand, which is what you want to see, but let's get that shooting elbow in under the basketball. Again, here comes the pass. Ideally in this particular drill, I'd love to see him maybe step and meet this pass. Maybe step with his left foot, follow by the right and catch and shoot. Here he's just waiting on the pass and the reason you want to meet this pass is two-folded. One, you want to meet your pass so a defender doesn't step in and steal it. And then secondly, it helps you utilize your lower body and the legs to help or what give you power to get the ball to the basket. And then this is a really good look. He is doing a good job here. You can see he's reaching out for the basketball. I'd love to see him move his whole body, but he does have his arms out which is really good. He's a right-hand shooter. See how both his hands are kind of the same? You want to bring this right hand and backstop that pass. So that's kind of how you want to shoot it. And then use this hand here, the left hand, the non-shooting hand, to help guide that ball into the backstop. So that's kind of how you, you know, I would love to see that the hands, maybe this hand especially, moved around here just a little bit.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This was actually her best attempt. As you can see, the placement of the ball is right here. It's outside this line. Well, we'll say it's on the line. Just slightly outside that line. It's close enough to the line where even though she's using backspin, instead of doing more backspin, because the placement is close to that line and the angle that she actually released it from is going to drop down into this basket. The angle that she used to shoot the ball and the angle from where she released it and actually hit the backboard is perfect for the use of backspin if you're not able to use sidespin because you actually need to practice it a little bit with the sidespin. If you don't know how to use the sidespin and you have the typical backspin on your release, this is really, really good. The issue that she had while she missed this shot is because, once again, she put too much power on the shot and so the ball came flying over the front of the rim. She ended up missing the shot. She had a little bit of a softer touch. The angle where this ball would have dropped right into the basket. As you can see, it's also above this top box. The higher the ball is above this box, the softer the touch is needed for it to drop into the basket here. The placement of where she hit it on the backboard was excellent. Just have to soften the touch up so the ball would drop into the basket. As we talked about previously, she stepped in with this outside foot first. And then she's going to put this left foot back down here for a two foot jump for her layup. Just coming from the direction that she came from is not the proper footwork. And is putting herself at a disadvantage to actually finish the shot. As you can see, once again, she did a two-foot reverse layup. Did a good job of placing it. The ball hit this corner of the box. Did a good job of hitting the correct spot on the backboard that we want to hit. But again, since it was too strong and she put too much force on it, as you can see, the ball ended up coming off strong from this backboard here and coming up and over and coming up over the front of the rim, resulting in the missed shot. So it was very important that we not also hit the correct spot off the backboard for our reverse layups, but we also have the proper amount of touch so that it doesn't come off too strong and we missed the shot entirely. Okay, so you can see on this shot here, she's actually hitting. So we have this box right here, the outside box. We have that line of the box right there. As you can see, the ball is on the outside of this box. But the shot that she uses, she doesn't put any side spin so the ball isn't rotating this way. Let me see if I make this a little bit clearer. So basically the ball isn't rotating at this angle. Like if we have a side spin, it will rotate that way. The way she's shooting, the ball is rotating this way. So since we have that spin on the ball, and she hit it here, the ball is coming straight back to us this way. Where the ball hits here, the ball pops back out this way. If she put spin on the ball, it would spin into the basket on the release. Now in order, if we're going to shoot the ball where there's no spin, the angle that she's at, we will have to hit somewhere in this area where the ball will hit the back board here and then hit the back board in this area and then drop right back into the basket. And also too, we need a little bit of touch, a softer touch on the shot because she's putting so much power into the shot. The ball is coming here and coming off the backboard really, really hard and over the rim to the point where even if she was to hit the correct spot with no rotation somewhere in this area, the ball, she still would not make the shot because she's throwing the ball too hard off of the backboard. So she would need a little softer touch off the backboard and hitting the correct area since she didn't put any side spin on the ball. It's more of the traditional front spin, excuse me, the traditional back spin on the ball. You see on this shot the ball, she put the back spin on the shot. She put the back spin on the ball when she shot the ball and the ball hit here on the backboard which is outside this line of the box on the backboard. So anytime the ball hits the outside that line on the backboard of the box, it have to, that ball must have this side spin in order for it to hit here and it can spin and the trajectory of the ball will go in towards the basket. But since she has that back spin and the ball is spinning in this direction, the ball is going to hit the backboard here and this come right back. So for this one I had to go a few frames past where I wanted to just because the player's hand was in the way and you couldn't see clearly. But on this one, that placement, she actually hit the ball here off the backboard, which is below this line or on this line. Even if it's on that line, that's not enough. We need it to be above this line at the bare minimum. Bare minimum, no matter what level that you're on, whether you're playing a really low level or at a higher level. At a lower level against less athletic people, we can get away with hitting the ball and get on our layups and hit it on this line because we're not worried about someone coming in and blocking our shot. But if somebody is really, really athletic and we have to get the ball up high over their hand, we want to try to hit it up higher on the top of the box. But even still, anything on this line or below that line is going to be really difficult and really lessen the chances of us getting the ball into the basket just because the angle will not work. Also, as she put so much force and power into this shot, the ball is going to come off long and over the rim and missing the rim completely. Since she didn't put any side spin on the ball, the placement where she hit it, if we had the ball rotating with side spin, and the ball is rotating this way, the ball is spinning that way, the ball will hit the backboard and spin in into the basket. But since she has the spin with the backspin and the ball is actually spinning this way, since the ball is spinning that way, once the ball hits the backboard, the ball is going to come back at that angle following the trajectory of the backspin. So, that's why with this shot right here, it hit the backboard and she put so much power on it that it just came back this way from where she originally shot the ball. on this shot right here. Again, she hit the ball outside of that line on the square of the backboard. Since the ball is on the outside of that line, we will need side spin in order for it to come off. But since she didn't put any side spin on this shot with the ball hitting that spot on the backboard, it's not going to spin into the basket the way we want it to. It's just going to come back out short of the rim. Also, she put too much power into this shot. So if she was to make this placement instead of the ball hitting here, if she shot it and the ball hit the backboard in this area, it would drop in. But since it was too much power, no matter if she hits the correct spot or not, this ball is going to come off over the front rim because she's put way too much force and too much power into the actual shot. So she would need a softer touch for the ball to hit off this backboard and go nice and easy into the basket. Unfortunately, this player didn't take any dribbles while she was doing the demonstration, so every repetition was a travel. Because she didn't take any dribbles, but it would assume that she took a dribble. And she finished with, she's going for a two foot reverse layup, every shot layup reverse layup she did on this one on the right side of the basket was off two feet. So that was the premise that she was purposely attempting to do a two foot reverse layup. This right here, you can see this part was really good as far as stepping with the inside foot. She steps with that left foot, and then she's going to take this right foot here, and she will place it down over in this area here to square herself up to the basket for the shot. Like her footwork to end the shot was decent. On this layup, she switches up her footwork and she steps with her outside foot first, this one being her right foot, and then she's going to bring this left foot on her second step and then jump off two feet for the layup. Now for a beginner, like as you can tell, like watching, like just watching this clip, you can see that she is relatively new to the game. So like this footwork here is good, useful for a situation where you get an offensive rebound or a pass and you're directly underneath the basket and you have to do a hard power dribble and you will step with your outside foot first and then bring your left foot first to get from underneath the basket and get yourself into an area where you can make the shot. So if she was starting directly underneath the basket and she did this footwork, that would be the correct footwork. But coming off the dribble from the opposite side of the floor for this reverse layup, that would be incorrect footwork in this situation. So it is really, really important that you also have the proper footwork and with the moves that you do in order to give yourself the best chance to actually make the shot. As you see, on this one, she did a good job of getting further over to the right side of the basket, giving her a better angle. As you can see from here, she has a straight angle because she got further over to where she can hit it right off the ball, can go right off the top corner of the box, and go straight in. So, for this one, even though she didn't put any side spin on it, it was more of the traditional back spin for the layup. The angle she got to, the placement on the floor that she got to, is a perfect spot for this layup. But unfortunately, she even did a good job of hitting it in the correct spot, the top corner of this box. As you can see, she hit the top corner of this box. So, whether you put a little bit of side spin or the traditional back spin on it, it's going to go, because of the angle where she released it from, at this angle here, you see where the ball is coming from? The angle went right there. It's going to bounce back in and go into the basket. That's what would happen if she put the correct amount of touch. I had a softer touch. And since she put too much force into it, so even though she had the right angle, the ball went over the rim and out over the front of the rim. And she ended up missing the shot because she put too much power into the shot. So even though the placement of the layup and the ball off the backboard was correct, the fact that she put too much force into the shot itself led for the ball to come off long and too strong over the front of the rim. As you can see here, she has herself two of two feet. The body is both feet square to the basket. This is a, it's a good job of being square to the basket on the layup. However, she's running into difficulty because she's too far underneath the basket. As you can tell from this view here, like she's more so in this area. If she was to jump off one foot, she can jump from where she is right now, currently, and her momentum will guide her over more to here, jumping off one foot, which will give her a better angle to put spin off the ball and the air off the backboard this way. And she would have, but since she went off of two feet, she would need to get over more, more or so in this area, as far as, so she'd have a better angle to shoot it up off the backboard. Or, she would have to do a better job of extending this ball out in her right hand more and putting spin because the positioning that she's in right now, she's too far underneath the basket. So the position that she's in right now, instead of shooting it off the backboard, off the side here, her best opportunity to make this shot would be over the front of the rim here, whether it be straight in or high up over the rim and then off the backboard here and then back in.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Looking at the player go into his gather on the right frame from his right hand to reverse layup attempt. Again the player does really well at using the correct foot to jump off guiding his body's momentum towards the right side of the rim. Player also does a good job of keeping his eyes locked in on his target and also does very well at bringing his ball placement position towards his shoulders allowing more ball control and security on the finish. As a result, as we look on the left side of the frame from the player body's momentum, as we look on the right side of the frame, bringing him away from the basket caused the ball to be missed short. We will want the player to jump towards the rim, allowing a higher probability of guiding the ball properly towards our target area with the right amount of power and arc it needs to get above the rim. Looking at the player go into his right-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice that the player did really well again by jumping off the correct leg, which is going to be his left leg, allowing his body's momentum to carry him towards the right side of the rim. The player again also does a good job of locking his eyes on his target, helping him create a much easier finish, and also increasing his court awareness. Improvements the offensive player can make before going into his initial drive. As we look on the right frame, is getting his body placement position lower in the athletic stance to help create more balance on his drive, more explosiveness going into his jump towards the right side of the rim and also allowing the player to have a quicker drive getting to the rim. Looking at the finish attempt from the offensive player on the left frame, we can notice that the player did a good job of getting his follow through, going towards the direction of the basket, allowing the ball to have the opportunity of getting the proper spin and rotation it needs to hit our target area.

The top right corner of the box on the backboard, allowing the ball to develop the proper angle it needs to drop inside the rim, again resulting in a completed layup attempt. Looking at the release of the player's right-handed reverse layup attempt on the left frame, again the player did a good job of getting his follow-through going towards the direction of the basket which allowed the ball to rotate towards the basket, giving it a proper spin and angle. It needs to hit around our target area, the top right corner of the box on the backboard, allowing the ball to develop a proper and accurate angle of dropping inside the rim, resulting in a completed layup attempt. Looking at the player go into his right-handed reverse layup attempt on the right frame. Again, some improvements the player can make to avoid turnovers. In a game-like scenario, is bringing his ball placement position above his shoulders to create more separation from opposing defenders in a game-like scenario. Increase his ball control and security going into his finish. And also creating a quicker gap to release the ball accurately towards our target area. Looking at the release of the player's offensive right-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice on the right frame the player does a good job of scoring his shoulders towards the back of the rim on the release, allowing a better angle for the ball to be directed to, hitting our target area on the backboard. As we look on the left frame, the ball hits and it will hit the top right corner of the box on the backboard, allowing a proper angle of dropping inside the rim, resulting in a completed layup attempt.

Also does a great job of keeping his eyes locked in on his target to create a much easier finish. Looking at the player go into his right-handed reverse layup attempt. Again, we will want the player to improve on his body placement position being lower to the ground, allowing his drive to be more impactful by being quicker, more balanced, and more explosive on his jump going towards the right side of the rim. Looking at the player's release on the right frame from the player's right-handed reverse layup attempt, we can notice that the player's body's momentum is bringing him away from the basket, which does not allow him to properly give the ball the right amount of force, arc, and power it needs to get above the rim. Instead, as we look on the left side of the frame, we'll be missing short, and the ball will hit the side of the rim, bouncing out, resulting in an incomplete layup attempt. As the player is going into his gather, again, we will want the player to improve as we look on the right frame of staying low from his body placement position in an athletic stance to not allow, if being placed in a game-like scenario, opposing defenders being able to push him off his position by initiating contact. This will also help the player be more balanced on his attempt going towards the rim. Looking on the right frame, we can notice that the player did really well on his right-handed reverse layup attempt of squaring his shoulders towards the back of the rim after the release, allowing the ball to develop a proper angle. It needs to hit our target area and to have the opportunity of dropping inside the rim, resulting in a completed layup attempt. an improvement the player can make. Looking on the right frame is bringing his ball placement position towards his shoulder area, preferably above his shoulders to create more security and ball control on the finish.

So really nice position in a nice correct stance. So here she's just alternating feet and tapping her foot forward and then lifting her arms up left and right and then stretching out left and right. So nice job with the arms keeping them up high. I think her eye contact should be facing forward so not sure why she's looking to the corner but definitely can turn her body to be square to the front. Here, nice job. Both of her knees appeared bent in this area and her heels are off the floor. She is rotating her arms and shoulders correctly as well. So the whole last part I could tell she just wasn't sure of what she was doing. So I don't really want to judge that part. So here in this moment, her leg can definitely go out and if it does, that means this knee could be a bit more. So bending this right knee into more of a lunge can allow the left leg to extend out more. So here, really nice job stepping out. And as you see, she's stepping out. Her arms are swinging from side to side, kind of in the side U position. Her eyes are facing forward. Her hip is kind of popped out a little bit, and she's sitting in her hip to her left side. And the right leg, the knee is bent slightly as she steps out. So here I think is where she was looking to see the correct steps. So she, her energy definitely changed in this moment cause she's unsure. So here, really nice job in both turns where her arms are lifted up really high over her head in a nice shape. Her heels are off the floor. Her knees could bend here just a little bit more if she turns, but otherwise really nice job staying on the music and getting the turns around. Here she's taking three steps and then crossing her arm over as she steps and then rotating to the other direction.

Here you can see that he is picking up the garlic and green onion on the flat side of his knife or his mallet. This is a culinary expert level way of transferring cut vegetables into either a mixing bowl or a pan, essentially using the knife as an extension of your hand. Here you can see that he is seasoning his tomato mixture with salt as well. This is an appropriate step to take as the tomatoes cook. You would want them to be seasoned. Here you can see that he is using again the chopsticks to scramble his eggs. I would prefer to see a flat spatula or even a wooden spoon to do this process, but he obviously looks and feels very comfortable with this tool selection as it is. The next step is preheating his pan which he does over this gas burner. I believe he set the heat to medium-high. Here you can see that he is cutting his cherry tomatoes in half and again he's working with a very sharp knife which is always best whenever you're working with a dull knife. You're more prone to having injuries or not having a very good cut since the knife is not sharp. Once he peels his garlic clove, he takes the flat side of his mallet or chef's knife and hits the garlic clove so that it essentially smashes it. While the pan is preheating, he adds his oil to the pan. He could have also used either butter or pan spray in lieu of oil. This is to ensure that when the eggs are cooking they do not stick to the bottom of the pan. Once his eggs are seasoned, he uses two chopsticks to whisk them together. I would always recommend using either a fork or a wire whisk instead of chopsticks, but maybe this is the only tool he had on hand. He adds the cooked eggs back into the tomato sauce, which at this point is still fairly watery, but clearly he knows how he wants this recipe to end up. There he appears to add about a tablespoon of tomato paste or tomato sauce before covering it and setting it aside. Also, he adds about a fourth of a cup of water from a tea kettle and I assume this is also to begin the cooking process of the tomatoes if he does in fact want them to be more of like a stewed tomato. However, tomatoes contain a lot of water anyways so adding the additional water is an unnecessary step. The next step is seasoning the eggs and he is doing this with a salt grinder. This is, I do like the idea of grinding fresh salt into this dish, however I would like to see him use a measuring spoon so that he knows exactly how much seasoning to use. You would want to use no more than a fourth of a teaspoon. He repeats this technique with the tomatoes as well. The first step to cooking tomato and eggs is prepping your ingredients. You can see here that he has a wooden cutting board here and a very sharp chef's knife. He's also got a bowl of tomatoes, some garlic, and a scallion. Once the eggs are cooked for 30 seconds to a minute, he transfers them with the chopsticks into this mixing bowl here, and we'll proceed to the next step. Once his pan is preheated, he adds his eggs directly to the oil in the pan and I like that he immediately puts his dirty bowl back into the sink so as not to clutter his workspace. Now he has gathered two eggs from the fridge, which he cracks lightly on the side of his cutting board and then opens them into this mixing bowl. Using the back side of a flat spatula he seems to be pressing into the tomatoes. I assume this is to get them to water out and break apart as they are cooking. Keeping his left hand on the top part of the blade of the knife and holding it against the cutting board and using his right hand to go in an up-and-down motion, he is able to mince the garlic very quickly. This is the expert level culinary technique way to chop garlic. The final step is transferring your cooked eggs and tomatoes into your serving dish, which he does here from the skillet with his flat spatula into this mixing bowl. He finely chops the scallion I'm assuming to use as a garnish but you can see that he has a relative ease with his knife work that is above average for a home cook.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

The first time the laces are kind of used here. So we see the toe pointing down and that foot is going to come through the ball generating that little bit more power. We see short approach so the players got to do something to try help generate this power. So they've planted in, kind of jumped into this one, getting down low and getting that leg diagonally out to the side so it can remain a little bit straighter than the left leg currently is and therefore getting more of a kind of a whipping action using the laces as a connection point on the foot. This kick doesn't have a great point of entry but it is hit with a lot of power and a lot of speed. Hard to know whether it would be saved or not. If a goalie hesitates to their right this one is going to go in but if they try guess left and they could easily save this one. With this one here the stance is a lot less neutral. We can see the standing foot pretty much pointing and aiming towards where this ball here ends up going which is the bottom corner. But from the connection on the ball to the entry in the goal is a very good example of a penalty kick. Pretty much unstoppable when you get a ball that far into the inside of the post and the side netting. I don't think a goalkeeper has much of a chance in getting down and across that fast and that far when it's placed there. So looking for a good example of a PK, that one has got a massive chance of going in the goal regardless of who the goalkeeper is. Similar finish to the last one here, just opposite side again, quite close to the centre of the goal with this little amount of power. Just want to see this one a little bit further over into the bottom right and away from this point, especially with that power being low. Gives the goalie a chance to kind of predict and get down in time to make the save. In terms of the approaches of all these shots, very short, not quite giving themselves the best chance to have the best outcome in my opinion. Could be a longer run up, a little bit more patience to set themselves up and therefore they can try to add a little bit more accuracy to the shots. Probably the lowest pick, lowest quality pick of the bunch so far in this video. Very short approach and the ball enters in goalie territory just centered in net, not a lot of power because it's a short approach. Inside of the foot just lofted up there and if I'm a goalkeeper in this one that's an easy catch and an easy save. And then we see the resulting kick placed quite well. However, we see the ankle is coming through before the toe. So if any spin is going to be created on the ball, it's going to be this kind of a spin, which is going to cause the ball to go from left to right, which could end up seeing this ball drifting wide. A better technique that I would like to see would be the foot coming around more this angle and getting more purchase around this side of the ball to create this sort of a curve, giving the ball a bit of an insurance policy. So it could look like from this point to this point, it could look like the ball is headed wide, but the fact that the spin would be on it means that it kind of comes back in and kind of nestles into this side netting area here, making it harder for a goalkeeper to dive across and save. So we think about a goalie, airborne, trying to make that dive over across the goal to make that save. If we hit this, like this player's hit it from kind of a left to right because the foot is facing this way, that goalie has much more of a chance of just getting a nick on this ball. But if we come in around it this way, we create more of a curve around. It's much further away from here to here than it is from here to here. Just to touch on the approach here, just something very small but can be a big telltale sign. Before this player kicked the ball I already knew they were going to go to the right. The reason why was because we see them move slightly in this direction before now coming over here. So if a player moves in this direction they're obviously trying to open up the possibilities for kicking a shot more so in this direction. They're pivoting around the opposite direction of where they want to go. So the player kind of takes a step here, opens up and then steps in to take the shot. So this short approach makes it very obvious just in that one quick step. Again if we take a longer approach we can adjust on the run so if we maybe carve a run even this way coming around we can still then go to the right and it's not as obvious as just a short step and turn into this. So in this video we are going to be looking at penalty kicks. Some of the criteria we will use to judge the proficiency score will be the following. So we will look at the technique and connection in the shots. The power and trajectory generated from the connection. The point of entry upon entering, crossing the line into the goal. The approaching angle and run up before the connection is made. The body shape in relation to the direction of the kick. So straight ahead looking into this first one. We can see a good approach. So the standing foot pretty neutral. Facing pretty central. The player manages to lean. Slightly to their left. This leg is leaning slightly to the left. Body quite neutral. What this allows to happen is, even though the player is facing pretty much straight on on approach. It allows them to open up this right foot. And have that space for the right foot to come through. And to guide the ball into an area which is going to be hard for a goalkeeper to potentially stop. So if we see a goalie in the goal here. That one is going to be hard for them to get across. And save. But also hard for them to predict where it is going. Based on the angle that the standing foot is standing at. And the manner in which the player approached the ball. Again, just seeing a series of rushed kicks here that are going quite central into the net with no real power. I feel like the player has more quality to show and if they take the right steps to set up the penalty, we would see many more quality kicks in terms of their points of entry being closer to the sides. A similar line to the last one in terms of where it crosses the goal line. Not quite as high as the last one, quite low but a similar line. We can see the foot here opened up perpendicular, even wider than where it has went. We talk about trying to curl the ball. If this foot could be brought at more of this angle around the ball to try and guide it with that curve, this shot potentially goes in. So it's just the locking of the ankle, the angle of which the foot is twisted. The ankle is almost coming through the ball before the foot which is never going to help it come back from right to left if anything it's going to push it left to right. I like the stance in this kick here. The player comes in quite neutral, slight bend in the knee, a little bit of a lean back, arms up for balance, which is great. And then we can see the right leg ends up coming in and kind of coming across the body and guiding that ball across the goal, which is great. It's not made very obvious before the shot is taken. However, just room for improvement, and this one would be a longer approach to generate that extra power as there's not much power in this. And then the ball enters this kind of area here. Would be harder to stop should it be placed further over in a corner. So yeah, some good and some not so good in this, or some room for improvement. Overall, a decent connection, good stance. But again, would just like to see this player approach with a little bit more speed and get more whip on the shot and try to get it across into the side netting a little bit more. So the approach in this one, very short. The player consistently not giving themselves a huge chance to adjust their body for more accuracy. Just kind of constant fast decisions, quickly rushing into the shot. We can see this one, point of entry here. Can we talk about a goalkeeper? If they're guessing a side, they just have to fall over pretty fast to stop this one and make that connection with the ball to make the save. So we want to see again, instead of the ball being here, could we be closer to the inside of the post? Just a lot further away from the goalkeeper. The inaccuracy in the pretty central shots right now. I think just down to the short rushed approach. With this one here, a very rushed short approach, kind of one step into it. We see a low power, low entry, low angle on the shot. Can we kind of think about if there's a goalkeeper standing in this area? They try to get down to this pretty reachable, should they guess, to go to their right, to the penalty kick taker's left. Room for improvement on this one would be way over in this corner, trying to keep it away from that central point. Especially with this distance being 7 yards, normal PKs are going to be more around this distance or 12 yard distance.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

And then also, nice job in the lower body with the knees bent and then tapping his toe forward. So here when he crosses over, again, I think his energy is starting to deplete a little bit. So he wants to keep that same energy level up, as well as stepping a bit more on his toes and less on the flat foot, keeping the knees bent. And again, keep that same rotation in his arms. And then a little bit more movement in his neck and like shoulder head movement. When he turns over to his left, it's a little bit slower with his head whipping around. It's still a turn, so you still want to keep that same whip of energy when spinning around. So the dentist just starts stepping in place. He has a really nice strong energy when he begins. I do notice his neck is moving back and forth as well as his arms rotating around and he's getting his feet off the floor slightly as he steps. His knees can be bent just a little bit more but really nice opening for this. So when he turns to his right, it's a really nice sharp snap of a turn so you see his head quickly rip around and get around back to the front. When he's stepping forward and back, again, being more on the toes, so pushing that weight forward and less on the heel and flat foot. So here when he steps out to the side, this heel should be off the floor, but really nice job stepping out. He can definitely push his hips a bit more and get a little more movement in his back.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

So whenever that happens, it does force the climber to have to engage their arms Because their body weight is completely 100% on their upper body at this point. So it does make it hard To control this just because they're using up so much more energy by doing that And so I'd always encourage climbers to really focus on Allowing their body to rotate and pivot correctly around their feet So then that way they can help reduce the opportunities of the feet coming off the wall like this And so here we can see the climber was able to make the next move of bringing the left hand up right here. So the climber was still in the same position of hanging on with the right hand and then I'm using the high left foot. So it's really nice to see that the climber kind of preemptively put herself in a really good position by placing the high left foot. So that's always kind of something that you can think about when considering to use a low foot or placing a higher foot. It's because sometimes if you place a higher foot a little earlier on, it could help you out with future movements. But it's definitely something you want to gauge from Boulder to Boulder because each one kind of requires its own difficulties. So here we can see the climber was able to make the first move of bringing the left hand up into this handhold here. And in this position we can see that they're hanging on with the right hand here. And they do have a left foot behind their body right here, it's kind of hard to see. So because they're using opposite points of contact with the wall, which is the right hand and left foot, this does allow them to rotate and pivot around that left foot, so that the left side of their body gets closer to the wall, allowing them an easier opportunity to reach up with that left hand. So this is a good position to see. The one thing I'm noticing though is that with their flagging foot, that we can see it kind of in this bent position here. So before her movement continued, or before she committed to the move, we can see that her flagging foot was out and to the right. But as she committed to that move, that flagging foot got into that bent position, kind of similar to like a kicking position is what she did. And so this kind of helps to generate a little bit of power for this movement. But by doing that, it also helps to create a lack of control of what's going on with their movement. So with that flagging foot in the direction that it is at right now, it does help to pull her body away from the wall. And so it completely relies on the climber being able to grab that next handhold to get good control of what's going on with their body weight. So this is something I would kind of discourage for climbers, just because it does make it hard to complete harder movements, and especially if you're going to smaller handholds, because you have kind of that lack of control already going on. It can make it hard to have the hand-eye coordination of where to place your hand, just because there's so much going on with your body moving it around. And so here we can see the Clamor was able to bring their left hand over so they now matched on the same handhold. And in this position the Clamor was hanging on with the right hand here and then managed to get a really high left foot here. So I really like this high left foot just because it helps to really push her body weight over to the right. And the reason why that's important is because it allows her to place her body weight directly underneath her right arm. The only thing I wish to see in this movement here is if she allowed herself to be in a straight arm position because right now she's having to pull and engage with the arm which does use up a lot of energy very quickly. So I'd always encourage Clamors to try and keep their arms straight so then that way they can conserve their energies but as they're ready to commit to movements then they can start pulling in. But if you keep yourself in a pulled position it does use up a lot of energy very quickly. And so here we can see the climber was able to bring their left hand over into the next handhold and in that position we can see that the climber was hanging on with their right hand and they do also have a right foot on the wall right here. So as they committed to doing this move here we could also see that their left flagging foot was originally out to the left and we can see that it got kicked over to the right. So again it's kind of this kicking motion that kind of creates a lack of control in the climber just because it's relying on that kicking force to generate the power but because it can also kind of send a small shockwave through the body so it kind of creates that imbalance overall. So again it completely relies on the climber being able to hang on to that left hand in this case to really control that movement. So I would definitely encourage climbers to really make sure they flag their foot in the direction that they want it to be in so that when they're doing this movement they can be in better control and that way they're not swinging around so much. And so here we can see the clamber was able to make the next move of bringing the right hand up into this next handhold here. And in this position we can see that they are hanging on with the left hand there and they were able to get a higher right foot. So again we're using opposite points of contact with the wall right here to be able to reach up to that right hand hold. The one thing I'm noticing though is that she is getting a little bit of rotation going on so that the right side of her body gets closer to the wall, but not too much rotation going on. So we can see that the clamber is being forced to have to pull in with their left arm in order to complete this move here. So what I'm seeing here is that there's not so much focus on the lower body to complete this movement here. It's more on her upper body to be able to complete this move just because her body is more facing forward and into the wall. So this naturally kind of forces her to have to pull to complete the movement. So this does require a little bit more energy and a little bit more power, which might be something that this clamber is comfortable with doing, but it does use up a lot of energy very quickly.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Or continually try to make a very forceful pull up so the climber is able to engage his hips close to the wall. That way when the climber gets to gain height, he's able to place the hand inside the hold. This one would be a closed grip once the climber gets to place the fingers behind the edge. The climber is starting at a two hand hold start, meaning that each hand is holding to its own hold and the right hand is holding on to where there seems to be a pinch as the climber sends the thumb over to the other side. Placing the thumb will help the climber generate more pressure when squeezing the hold. The left hand, we can see how the climber is holding on to a shallow hold so the climber places the entire hand above it. In order for the climber to sustain each grip, the climber will have to create pressure by pulling away on the pinch and keeping the elbow close to the wall once he gets to apply weight onto the grips. The climb will start until the climber places the feet on the wall and is no longer on the mat. The climber here is going up for the reach. As we can see, he has engaged into a forceful pull-up, then to quickly press down on the left foot, that is the one leg that is out on the flag, so that the climber is able to raise his hips towards the wall, this one being the center of gravity, so that the climber is able to transfer the weight over to the highest foot placement. When the climber is going up for the reach, he has looked up to see the hand placement, and in the moment that he's pressing on the toe, the right toe being the foot placed the highest, we can see how the climber is actually being pushed away from the wall. This because the foot is, the climber is bringing the knee into the wall, so instead of keeping it out, this is not a good position for the climber when going up for the reach, as ideally he would have to place the left foot on a higher stance and let the right foot be out on a flag instead, reason why the climber is unable to make the reach up to the hold.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

Realistically the climbers hips should be up here, equidistant between these two holds and sort of jump into the position where they can be equidistant. The climbers hips are just too low and too outside to maintain this foot cut. So here we have this brick pinch start and the climber is staring up at the target hold here. In here you have the climber on this pinch. This is what we would call a descending pinch. So basically the taper of this hold, if these vanishing points of the pinch were to continue, it would be like an upside down triangle, which makes it really difficult to grab. If this pinch were flipped upside down, 180 degrees from where it is now, it would taper in and the usable surface would be a lot easier to access. But when it's a descending pinch, you have to grab it a lot harder in order to not slip off. So that's one of the reasons why the climber might be struggling with this sequence, just because this pinch is technically facing the wrong direction, if you can say that about a hold.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This was so the climber was able to gain height by pressing down on the left toe being in place and the right hand pinching down on the hold. The climber brings the right hand into a match. This one, the climber must show control over his position and his stability while sustaining the hold with two hands in order to hold the climb completed. The climber after bringing the left hand for the next hold, he quickly sends the left hand for one extra move. This is called bumping, when the climber has done two moves with the same hand on the same push stance. The climber is working on a step up start, meaning that the climber, once he places the feet onto the wall after holding onto the grips, then the climb starts. In this case, the climber is holding onto two handhold starts, so each hand has its own hold and they are different. The left hand being a jug, as the climber is able to send the fingers behind the edge of the hold to pull himself and secure the grip by pushing down with the thumb. The thumb is just being in place as the climber engages the fingers on the pull behind the lip of the hold. For the right hand, the climber must apply pressure by placing his weight with the arm extended to create friction at the fingertips of the hand as it's an open hand placement, which is a sloper. The climber is holding to a sloped hold, meaning that it's rounded. Now the climber is applying the feet onto the wall. The right foot is the one that is being placed right now and the left foot will be coming into placement. In this instance, the climber needs to go for the next hold. This one, being slightly at reach, the climber places the left foot at a high stance. This will help the climber when engaging onto a push, stepping up over the hold, and bringing his center of gravity close to the wall so that the climber is able to release the left hand to go up for the reach. Quickly, the climber had sent the right foot into a high foot placement. So then the climber was able to transfer the right hand from the pinch hold and the left hand from the previous hold to now having both hands come and join at the same hold. This is called a match and both of the hands are placed right now on a jug, meaning that there is a large lip where the climber can wrap the hands around it. And now this is a reliable hold so the climber is able to only apply the grips and able to extend the arms to rest as he glances over to the wall. As the climber makes the next move, he sends the right hand onto the rail. This one, the climber immediately applies a pinch grip because he sends the thumb onto the other side of the hold and squeezes the hold to then apply pressure once half gone for the reach. The climber was able to make the reach because he stands up over both of the feet, but the right foot is the one that helps him to gain reach as the left foot is the one that the climber applies to push away so that the climber can remain underneath the hold, pushing him over to the right side. Also, the climber's right, having the right foot position low and the left foot position high helps the climber to have a twist of the body to keep his right side close to the wall, making it easy for him to go up for the reach.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

Here he's touched the ball out again and is hitting a moving ball. Again, a not illegal penalty kick, but for this instance we're not looking at that. What he's being forced to do as he tries to come around the ball with the kicking leg here is at the very last minute he has to pivot that left hip open and plant that left foot next to the ball. You can see how far left that thing is placed in terms of the direction. It's going this way. He's had to really do that. Then now at the same time he's having to bring his hip will come around here and the foot will come around at the same time too. It's not a very effective way to control where the ball wants to go because he has to do this whole mechanism of turning and pivoting with his hips and his feet and at the same time bring his leg around and hit it. What that's going to do is not give him a lot of consistency on where he's making contact with the ball. This could go anywhere. If he gets it too far wrapped around this side it could go off that way. If he slices down on the ball and only gets a piece of it it could go that way. If it goes forward into the goal it could lack power just because his momentum and the way his body is going is not going towards his intended target. My recommendation here to improve it would be place the ball down central, take a consistent run up into the ball, pick a spot in the goal that you would repeat every single time to try to hit from a target perspective and then use the similar technique every single time whether that's inside of the foot or laces so that he gets good repetition. So here, he's moved the ball around again. So again, I have to recommend that he just be more consistent with the setup of where he's placing the ball down. The ball is stationary, so that's positive. And the one thing I want to point out now is this non-kicking foot. And what you can see in this picture pretty clearly is the direction that it's going is out somewhere in this direction. And what we teach is that that is actually, like where that foot points to be a natural alignment or a natural aligner for your hips and where they face. And we want them to go towards the target. If it's too far this direction over here, there could be a chance that it throws off this kicking foot and number one, where it could contact the ball, but then two, how he follows through. And depending on the surface that he uses, it could cause errors. The ball could slip out and go this way if he doesn't give enough surface. If he hits too far on this side of the ball, the ball could also go wide that direction. So he has to sort of slice at the ball and then follow through that direction just because his foot's planted there. And what that will do, that is actually generate less power. Even if he gets this accurate, it'll be less powerful than what it could potentially be. So the fix here is just get that non-kicking foot pointed and facing the direction of his intended target. The other thing that he's doing now if he doesn't take a run up is that he has no transfer through the ball in the intended direction that he wants to go. What I mean by transfer is his body is standing straight up as he kicks the ball and he's not landing on this kicking foot in the direction that he wants to go. He's almost leaning straight up, if anything, a little bit back too far. What that's doing right away is as he's making contact on the ball in this instance here is that he's following through this way towards the outside of the goal and that's naturally where the ball is going. He's not giving the ball more direction of where he actually wants it to go. Two things here. One is where he contacts the point of contact on the ball and then the direction of the follow through. If you would improve those two things, pick the spot that he wants to kick on the ball every single time and pick the spot in the goal and then follow through towards that intended target every single time. That will give him more success in controlling where this ball goes. Right now it's a little bit out of control and that's why the ball is going wide of the goal from short distance, which is something that shouldn't happen. So this is again just showing the, if he's gonna take an angle of approach that's super like to the side of the ball, this is what it looks like where he has to jump and land with that left foot. And you can see so his foot is pointing this direction, but his hips, his upper body, everything is pointing that direction. And it's just contrasting forces. So there's like the only way he's gonna generate power is by bringing that leg around and having a quick leg action, which is what to be fair what this player is good at is that he does have a quick quick leg action with terms of like the back lift when he brings his leg up and then swinging through the ball. And that helps him to generate power. But he lacks a lot of control of where the ball goes and also the trajectory of the ball. And so like if he just corrected his run up with the techniques like ability that he has to kick the ball to generate power, I think he would be a lot a lot more accurate, a lot more effective in taking these kicks. So the subject is performing the penalty kick where he's placing a stationary ball, should be 12 yards away from the goal. And so this is set up correctly where he's hitting the stationary ball. And the other thing that you can see is that he's taking a short run up by backing up two steps, two, three steps away from the ball to then run up into the ball to then initiate the kicking sequence. This is something that we'll actively watch to look up for as we go through the different repetitions to see if this is consistent throughout. So what we're seeing here is that he took a proper run up to this ball on this attempt here and he's getting that plant foot next to the ball which is much better. It's not behind the ball and he's not coming from the side and he has to rotate his hips. So I think he took a slightly off center angle in terms of his run up. He got that plant foot next to the ball. That's nice. He's got his knee over the ball because he's using his instep so his toe is more pointed down. So I think from a standpoint of the technique using his instep relays that's good. His upper body is a little bit upright for me. I prefer to be a little bit more over the ball if possible in terms of his head down, head over the ball, arms out to the side for a little bit more balance. Like that left arm could be up a little bit more here in this direction. That would help him I think in that sense. But the one thing I'm looking at also right away is that the way in which he's following through is always across his body and what that's causing him to do is slice the ball. So even though he's making a good contact point, his follow through goes this direction as opposed to going towards the goal. So that would be the recommendation that I think he should do is try to every single time he strikes the ball is that he's following through towards his intended target. Just to be clear here, he just touched this ball out and then he's striking a moving ball or a rolling ball. Per the laws of the game, this would be an illegal kick that would not count as a penalty. So, pointing out right away with the second repetition that the original ball was placed in the center. This is where it should be placed every single time. He's already moved the ball over to another place. And so that's the first difference. And the second difference is that he's now taking up a much more harder angle. When I was coming this way into the ball as opposed to before where he was running a little bit more from behind but off center. The biggest difference of what that does is that it will make it much more difficult for him to hit this side of the goal because of the angle of approach. His hips will naturally sort of go like towards this way. So it's more likely that he would try to hit that side of the goal. There's not a problem with that. It's just that because of the angle of approach, a goalkeeper could read that and anticipate a shot to his left side or that side of the goal. That would be something that I would recommend. Number one, put the ball back to where it should be at the beginning every single time. Number two is that practice the repetition that a slightly off center run up and use that technique multiple times. And then that would give him opportunity to hit to the right or left of the goal. But at least the setup would be very consistent.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

She kind of stayed right in the same place. So try to really push her legs and her body to jump a bit wider. And so here when she turned she didn't get all the way around front. She kind of had to adjust her body to straighten up. So I think that just meant she just needed to have a little more energy around when she spun around to turn to get her body centered back to the front. So here in her turn here she didn't get all the way around. Again she had to adjust herself so I think when you cross over and turn you have to cross over enough so that way your full body can land front to the to the main front center. So here's a moment where she had really strong arms in this one and the next when her arms come up. Just really nice stiff strong arms for a nice picture moment. So the dancer starts, is also stepping forward and back, stepping forward with her left foot and then also stepping back with her left. And she's moving her shoulders around nicely. So really good job starting in the beginning. So she had a really good body roll in the beginning. I think this one she kind of cut herself short, so try to bend those knees a bit. One leg could be further back, so that way she has a little more stability in her roll. So her legs are kind of split open a bit, but definitely bending those knees, and then she's able to roll from the bottom up. So because this is advanced, I really want her to push a little bit harder. So on this jump where she lands here, I think that jump could have been a bit bigger and really like accent of the music in this part, really throw that arm out and then kicking that leg back. So here when the dancer does the little toe heel dig, I really wanted her to make this a bit cleaner. Just really dig that heel, dig that toe, and then really step out on that leg. It just kind of came a little muffled together. So really being clear because there's a really clear beat. So trying to be as clear as she can on that beat.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

The dancer should also bend her right knee more so that this is more of a lunge position. She can do that by extending her left leg further behind her to widen her stance. The dancer also, once again, needs to take bigger steps. So all of these steps in which she's stepping and touching her toes on angles, the foot that goes outward before she brings the other foot inward, which alternates from right to left, she needs to make that first step outward bigger so that she's using more space. And overall, she's widening her stance with each step she takes. She's also grabbing her left hand onto her right hand at the wrist, which restricts how high up she could bring her arms. Instead, if she locks her fingers at her fingertips instead, she'll have more room to raise them higher up. The dancer's arms here are too condensed or restricted. She needs to make her arms longer in space so that they're higher above her head. The dancer should widen her legs here so that they're further apart, giving her the stability so that she can have more mobility in her upper body. The dancer's right foot here should be further away from her body and not so close to her left knee, more so as if it's on a 90 degree angle. Widening her stance would allow her pelvis to then drop further lower in between her legs since there would be more space between her legs and that would bring her whole body closer to the floor.

So the way he's spinning around in place, I could actually see him leading a partner and also spinning her around as they keep the same steps in rhythm. So I will say when he changes directions from facing the back of the camera to the front, he does that really well without breaking the pose or breaking the timing. Really good job for that part. But I would definitely add some sort of variety, even moving a little bit more throughout the space, adding both arms a little bit more, and just adding the energy up a bit higher because the movements are still looking the same. So from the beginning, he starts off the beat a bit and at this point of the song he's able to catch back on because he takes another step to the to the right. With bachata, the steps are very clear as far as the timing and it's always an eight count step. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. On the four and the eight count, that is when your hip kind of pushes to the side because all you're doing is stepping side, step together, step side, and then your hip kind of does a little bump or just the accent on whatever the last movement is. So to keep the rhythm, you always want to keep that one, two, three accent, one, two, three accent on the four and the eight, you get a little oomph. So overall, I just think this was not an advanced piece of choreography, definitely more beginner because he is showing the basic of a bachata step, but there isn't really much variety to his movement. He does have the gist of the step correctly. So just stepping step 1, 2, 3, and then touch, 1, 2, 3, touch. Make sure he adds a little more hip movement, a little more variety with the arms. He did do a really good job changing directions and facing different ways and doing that seamlessly, but just keeping the beat and the timing is something he could work on. So there he made a slight mistake. He took an extra step and now he's off the music again. So just making sure you're not taking any extra steps. Bachata does not call for that. You have a very clear number of steps that you take and you want to make sure you just take those steps so you don't get off the music. So this one he's doing a good job keeping back up with the rhythm and on the steps. I would suggest maybe using both arms to to move because right now he's really just using his left arm more and then also being up on his toes and then pushing those hips side to side on the four and the eight count.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

But instead of what he does, he kind of just casually brings his right foot back behind, creates some tension on the wall, and now it's almost like he's right and left foot switch places, and this kind of balances him out, and lets him kind of just reach up casually with his right arm, and not have his balance or weight shift around too much. Here's another example where he's really got to use his feet. He's on this really thin undercling. So if he pulls in, he's just going to pull himself closer to the wall. So this move, he's really got to drive up with the feet and really kind of pendulum around that anchoring point to make this big long span. So this move really only works with his feet in such a good position and really loading them because those feet come off. He's just coming straight down the wall and off the wall. So right off the bat, I like how much, you know, he's how much movement he's getting out of these holds. So he's pulling up a little bit on them, but I think it's because he's so close to the ground. He's just trying to prevent himself from from dabbing on the ground. You'll notice he starts way up to the right. He kind of hits this angled hold here. And immediately once he gets it, he kind of shifts all of his weight underneath it to try to make himself as straight below it as possible. Another thing too is watching him, he looks at his feet, moves them around, he doesn't do just one big foot movement, he kind of subtly moves his feet, shifts himself into a better position. So like this big reach, you know, his feet go from being way down to the left, so he walks them up and to the right. So now he's once again kind of plumb line underneath this hold, which is going to kind of minimize how much he's got to engage on that side. So now he's kind of in a pretty peaceful, but tensioned position, he's not kind of fighting it, he isn't pulling in, he's able to keep this tension through his arms and then move from it. He's just really engaging through the feet, so really getting into the right position, planting the feet, and then moving from that position, coordinating, pushing down with his feet while pulling with his hands.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

And he should instead be ending strongly. The dancer has been doing a pretty good job of staying on rhythm for the entirety of the dance. However, right now in this last forward and back basic salsa step, he rushed a bit. So now when he's going to start his next step, he is maybe half of a count early. He needs to take a breath and slow down slightly. However, when the dancer is moving right and left, he can be using more of the space here. He's doing a good job of being equidistant and returning to the center, but he's not traveling as far as he could to make the dance more exciting. The dancer could also be traveling further forwards and backwards. He has a great deal of space at his disposal. So as long as he's equidistant and gets back to the center, there should be no limit to how far he's traveling forward and backwards. Or the only limit really that there should be is the extent of the room. So he should be taking bigger steps to make his dancing more exciting. The dancer needs to have more energy throughout the entirety of the routine but especially towards the end of the routine he just got lower in energy especially though some of the choreography got more exciting with the spins where it's a basic salsa step but it's a more complicated salsa step than the ones in which he was facing forward and his energy should have been brought higher to match the more complex choreography or harder choreography that he didn't bring his energy to reach that level. The dancer can also make his turn sharper by extending his spine right now. He's a bit crunched We see his spine is a bit crunched here. It's fine that his leg is bent That's not what I mean by extending his spine and being taller. It's just his upper body can be pulled upward just really Standing up completely tall as if you're standing in a chair or sitting in a chair with a Back against the Against the back of the chair right now. It's as if he's slouching forward slightly The dancer needs to articulate his feet more whenever he uses a foot and moves it here. He moves his right foot outward to his right. He should really articulate picking up his foot. I feel as if his foot barely makes it off the ground. And it's good that he is smooth. By no means is he stiff with his leg movement, but his leg movement needs to be more detailed and crisper and more accentuated. The dancer is trying to turn around to the front of the room on flat feet. His foot is flat on the ground while he's turning. It's going to make it harder to turn and also makes his turn a bit weak. It's not as sharp as it could be. He could help himself make his turn sharper by putting his weight onto his toes and picking up his heels off the ground. The dancer has great energy in his shoulders in these toe taps, but he also can be engaging his hips and using them here as well. The dancer does a good job of returning to the center on the dot in the room when he's moving right and left. He does go back to the center position.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

I feel like the dancer is on rhythm, but he's very very close to moving too fast Just a smidge just a hair It would be best if you took a breath and slowed down just slightly He is technically on the rhythm He's doing the steps on the proper counts, but it's very close to being off the counter too fast For instance the second step he does the step that's odd to the center He does do it on the second beat of the group of four But it's it barely is on that beat So it would be in his best interest just to take a breath and slow down ever so slightly With bending his knees though, he also should still be picking up his feet. They don't have much movement here. The dancer does a good job of traveling equidistantly front and back. He uses the dot that he's standing on top of right now as his center, and he does return to the center each time after going forward or backwards. So that's a good spatial usage there. This last turn that the dancer just completed, he doesn't use his spot on his eyes as well as he should. His eye spot can be sharper when he's spinning. This time he spanned counterclockwise across the room. He's using his eyes, but he's taking in too much of the room because he's spinning with his head too slowly. If he whips his head around quickly, then he wouldn't risk getting dizzy as easily. His eyes being forward would allow his body to end exactly where he needs to be. His head is also too far forward. His head should be more back on his spine, sitting on top of his spine. Right now his neck is poked too far forward and it's not aligned. These last moments that the dancer is doing here seems a bit casual and it doesn't seem like he has that much energy and as great of execution as he had in the beginning of the dance. It's important that he finishes a dance strongly and doesn't lose energy. I think he's anticipating them shutting off the music and the dance being done but he should be concluding with just as much energy and should not stop or lower the energy level until the dance is actually done even if it's almost done. The dancer is condensing his spine here when he steps with his right foot outward. We also see that his spine is not aligned. It's leaning forward. His spine should be upright and in a vertical line. He can make more room for himself and for the rest of his spine by pressing up his neck upward. The dancer can be engaging his shoulders and his hips more in this basic salsa step, especially because it doesn't move, it's in place, which is fine. He does that while the choreography is meant to be in place, but because it isn't traveling, he needs to be using or engaging other parts of his body more, especially his hips and his shoulders here. It's good that the dancer is bending his legs here. It makes him not stiff. It's important in salsa dance that our legs aren't always pinned straight, that they do become bent at times to allow for movement. So that's what he is doing here.", "proficiency_level": "Late Expert"}

It looks like he just needs to maybe have a little bit more power, just, you know, latch it just a little bit. You can see his hand is like, you know, in this attempt he's maybe falling a little bit away, but he's got the speeds up the power. He can hit it. He just needs to hold it. And I think the thing is that he's kind of, as he rocks over onto the right, his knee is facing outwards. Whereas if it was facing inwards, he would kind of sit a little higher on it, and he'd be able to spring from a little bit higher position. So I think that's the only adjustment I might make.

So ideally, once the mixture came to a boil, the temperature would be lowered so so that you had just a gentle boil of the milk and water mixture. At this point, you would let that go on a low boil for approximately three to five minutes to extract out the maximum flavor of the tea. The preparer is using the back of the fork to press onto the tea bags. This is likely in an effort to extract tea flavor from the tea bags. However, the temperature of the milk has not come up to boiling at this point. So you're not going to get good extraction of the tea flavor no matter how much you press on the tea bags. Here the preparer is using the mug that they will be serving the chai in as a measure, and he has poured cold milk into the mug and in addition has added a little bit of water. This water and milk mixture is then being placed into a small saucepan to make the chai tea. The choice of saucepan is good. It's important to note that when making chai tea, it is personal preference as to water and milk balance. So some people prefer more water than milk, others prefer more milk than water. At this point, the milk and water mixture along with the teabags and sugar has just begun to boil. The preparer goes ahead and lifts the saucepan off the heat to prevent the mixture from boiling over in the pot. Sugar and two tea bags have been added to the milk and water mixture in the saucepan. However, the mixture has not come up to boiling at this point. The preparer has also chosen to use a fork to stir this mixture.

Here they are, just a little twist of the knee and a right lock off here gets into this pipe hold here with the left hand. The climber spends a considerable amount of time trying to remember what's on for the boulder and this is a super common struggle on spray walls, just kind of trying to remember what's on and what's not versus in a more commercial setting or a more typical competition setting where you have more sparse boulders where essentially everything that is available to you is on. So the spray walls have their own sort of unique tax to them in constantly having to remember what's on and what's not. The climber then kind of deliberates a little bit as to what to do with the feet, but ultimately they end up backstepping what was the start hold and pretty easily getting into this right hand, which is very similar to the previous right hand. Kind of looks like an ear, sharper, rounded in-cut hold. And here they are switching their feet from right to left, and they'll go into a square position. From the match the climber is able to go left hand to the dihedral here to a hold and I don't speak Spanish but I can imagine the climber was saying I'm tired or I don't know where my feet are supposed to be or something like this but I can imagine that climber is very tired not necessarily because this boulder is very difficult for them but because they had to spend so much time figuring out what the tracking was and tracking is basically what's on for the feet. Nevertheless they will get their left hand in on this hold and then cross up and right and match the finish hold and definitely a good fight for this send. Here we have the climber one move in on this boulder, started match on this yellow hold. They opted to start with the left foot on the start hold where most climbers start back step with the right foot on. This shows that the climber is pretty physically strong because that allows the climber to just kind of utilize a left lock off and push really hard with the left foot instead of the I guess more technically sound method of the right foot back step and getting the hip closer into the wall. But I do like this method. And again, trying to find the feet here. The climber is able to come up and match this pipe hold. Their feet actually cut. So what I was talking about earlier with the tension on the start foot, that happened here, hips swung out, but luckily the climber was able to utilize the backswing to come back and tag this foot and regain the position of the move. Climber then just sucks the hips in to the wall a little bit, locks down the right arm, and is able to easily cross left hand over into this crimp here, all while maintaining really nice core tension on the start foot. So the start, the foot here, the left foot, is pulling this direction, keeping the hips in this orientation that the arrow's pointing at, and it's fighting this swing out. So there's ever a possibility of the foot popping and the climber swinging out, but because the tension is there, the climber doesn't. Climbers then able to work their left foot onto a closer foothold and squaring up and locking down the right arm. They're able to go up and left into this hold here and it does not appear that they get it very good right off the bat, but they show a lot of stamina and discipline as well and chill in there until their body sort of swings in the right position and they're able to readjust and get it really good rather than trying to readjust right off the bat or get more or less flustered by getting it poorly originally.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

In this case, the climber needed to lean back and really trust the hold that he had with the arms extended or have found a position where he would be comfortable a little bit before that to not tire up the grip. Whenever the climber was ready, he would make the move out of it, not bringing himself into a crunch or engaging the body until he was ready to move up to the next hold. Here we can see how the climber has secured the heel hook by letting go of the right hand. This is because the climber as he was on the heel he has rolled on the heel inwards in order to lock the heel and gain more surface while the top of the foot potentially touched the wall, touched the hold above. Now since the climber now has a secured heel hook he has sent the right hand up for a match to the hold above. The climber doesn't have a space necessarily to go directly to the right side of the hold due to the left hand being already in place so instead has find a spot to the left side of that block. Now since the left hand doesn't need to be moving from that for the next move the next hand needed to be freed up is going to be the left hand as it needs to make the move out to the left side on the next hold. Here the climber has performed a technical move on the left hand. This now being placed on the block above, the climber is placing pressure with an open grip and mostly relying on the fingers above and placing the palm towards the outside of the block. Since it's an open hand, it's important that the climber can generate friction at the hold above. Now it's technical the way that the climber moved up the wall. First starting where the left foot was placed, where it was onto a match, quickly to move into the second hold which was a match and as well as moving out left to the hold and then bumping from that hold that he didn't spend a lot of time up to the block where he is now. This, the climber moved that hand onto those series of positions with making sure he was having a controlled foot placement and body movement, meaning body movement of throwing the center of gravity of the climber and to move along the base of support. The base of support, this is the points of contact that the climber has on the wall in order to free up the hand for those series of moves. Here we can see the climber how quickly moved the right foot into a match and then the reason why the right foot went up first was because the left foot was the driving force of pressure to carry the climbers weight. So does this release the pressure of the left foot and then once the climber was able to bring the leg up for a match, in this instance there is the both feet and the hand on this hold, does it by bringing over the left foot to then take over position for the match. The climber can be crunched up down at the bottom for the lower area of the body and at this time it's actually standing comfortably holding on to the grips creating more pressure from the hands while creating the foot swap at the match. The climber unable to reach the hold out left. We can see how he went for the throw and needed to apply friction as a type of hold the climber is going for. It's a bowl that's a smooth and rounded from the front. So the climber needed to create friction and keep an open hand by spreading the fingers to make the placement and keep the elbow in and drop weight onto it. The climber wasn't able to do this as he was hesitating to make it there and potentially if the climber was to do this again, he needs to stay down low and create momentum on the move forward out of taking off the left hand and standing up low then tall to make the reach to apply the right pressure to the hold next. Here we can see how the climber was able to engage the heel due to letting go of the foot down below. This means that the climber finally has transferred over the weight to the highest foot. In this instance, the climber was able to sustain the grip above by creating the right pressure and must stay as static as he can. Reason why the climber, instead of moving to a different direction, tried to bring the right foot at a high placement, going with the heel to be placed first. Since the heel is matching with the hand at this time, there isn't enough space into the hold, so the climber will have to work on moving the right hand over left side to allow room for the heel to rock into the hold. It is necessary that the heel is placed well as it would need to stay behind the edge of the hold. Since the climber is placing the heel hook, it would help the climber also having a third hand as he will be able to pull it towards himself when making the stance. Here we can see the climber starting at a two hand hold start. This the climber does by sustaining the hold on the right side and by push by pulling towards the climber and at the same time keeping the elbow slightly to the right side being pointed out to create pressure on the right hand grip. Now for the left hand down below the climber as we can see is pulling also on a jug and a jug is the same for both hands both holds where the climber is able to slide the fingers behind it and pull comfortably into it. The only difference is the direction of both holds are being pulled differently. In this case the lower hold the climber needs to pull the hold towards him or away from the wall in order to resist the grip. Now once the climber has placed the grips above then needs to work on moving the feet onto the wall. Once the climber gets to place the feet on the foot on the wall or the feet on the wall and is off the mat then the climb will start. Here we can see the climber struggling to keep on the grip, meaning friction to hang on to the block tight, and does this by generating more force of weight transfer to the hold above by leaning on the hold. Now he's trying to pull himself on the opposite direction to create that friction and also is aided by the climber moving the knee inwards as he pivots over the toe that's been placed on the wall. Here, once the climber had put pressure on the left foot that was placed on the matchdown below, was able then to create, transfer the weight over to the left foot, and the right foot went out onto a flag. This only to be balanced as he was sustaining with the right hand to hold above. Since the climber now had two points of contact, they look solid, one being the left foot on a big hold being a sideways jug, and then the jug above with the right hand, the climber was able to controllably let go of the left hand to bring the left hand into a match to the hold above. Here the climber is looking down at the feet. In this instance the left foot was the one that was being placed and the right foot was just hanging so that the climber was able to apply all of the weight onto the highest foot being the left foot at that time. Now it's good that for the climber in order to glance over to the feet is keeping the arms straight. This will help the climber to pull in when necessary needs to go up for a move but it can stay on the wall by pulling on the grips only with arms extended. That also being with the arms extended allows the climber to pull back and look down to the feet still being on a comfortable position while holding on to the wall.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This is a super pinchy boulder. So here the climber tries to maintain core tension through this right foot back step. You can see the climber is on the hold, and this is a totally viable option I think. But for whatever reason, the climber is not able to maintain tension through this. I think it has a lot to do with the difficulty of this left pinch, because you are maintaining a lot of the tension through this lock off. Subsequently your ability to grab that pinch. And so given that, the climber loses tension here and falls off the boulder.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

This one is a flat surface at the top being a pyramid so the climber must create contact of the palm towards the hold in order to create friction to sustain the grip since this one will be placed as an open grip unless the climber gets to fold the knuckles in order to create pressure onto the grip. It's important that the climber always glances down at the feet to make sure that she makes an accurate foot placement where she is placing the toe above the surface of the small foothold. Now as we can see the climber had intentionally made the position of the hand placements this one because she plans to keep the left hand on the initial hold to send the right hand over to the next hold at reach. Now the climb will start until the climber is no longer standing on the mat. Once the climber gets to apply pressure onto the toe she will be able to raise the hips off the mat. Unfortunately after the climber had brought the left leg to a flag the climber has slipped off from the hold that reach landing on the mat ending the climb. The climber keeps adjusting the left hand grip by placing the palm further into the wall. This so the climber can gain more surface of the palm towards the hold and manages to bring the right toe to perform a foot switch as the climber had glanced over at the feet and places the right toe over the hole to extend the left leg. This to allow the climber to lean over to the right side the way that the grip needs to be held. The climber is starting at a one hold start where she places both of the hands onto the same hold. This is called matching and as we can see the climber is sustaining onto the lip of the hold being a jug as the climber is able to place the fingers inside of the hold and to create more pressure to support the grips the climber places the thumbs from underneath to squeeze the hold. Now the climber is seated on the mat because this is starting at a sit start. Sit starts are known to add a grade of difficulty to the climb because the climber will have to bring the weight over to her placements and as we can see the climber has positioned the feet already onto the wall. Once the climber gets to press down onto the foot chips then she will be able to raise the hips once the climber is no longer sitting on the mat then the climb will start. Here we can see how the climber is forcing a twist of her body. This is because the climber must be laying over on the opposite direction of her hand placement. In this case because the climber is hooking the hold at the edge towards the surface of the hold, the climber must lay back over to the right side. The reason why the climber is twisting the body over to the right and support it for the climber and engaging this twist, the climber had brought the right toe to come into tap at the wall. As we can see, the climber has started the climb because he's no longer sitting on the mat and has kept the right leg to come out extended. This is called flagging out so the climber is able to transfer over the weight to the left foot being in place. Also, flagging out helps the climber to keep balance and stability over the move. The clumber chose to remove herself from the placements that she had positioned herself onto and instead dropped the placements to scoosh over closer to the wall and to reposition the hands. As we can see she is crossing the left hand over the right one and repositioning over the lip.", "proficiency_level": "Early Expert"}

It's good to remember that you always have more time than you think when transitioning from one note to another. This is a very good practice technique to isolate the hands, especially with piano, to understand the top line first with the right hand, and then the left hand with the bottom line. When playing this little run, the player is compressing the rhythms and also rushing through it. They should try to take their time and also just always practice slowly and understanding the movement from one note to the next between fingers. Left hand looks a little bit more blocked. I think while they're playing, they just need to make sure that they have a little bit more movement from the wrist to help guide their hand.

This is because the violist isn't using any of their wrist or flex in their fingers to do these quick string crossings. They're using all arm, even when it's a really fast string crossing like it is right here. And the arm is just going to be more aggressive and harder to finesse. Whereas if we used the wrist and the fingers just to make these small adjustments from one string to the next, we'd have a little bit more control and a little bit of a lighter touch and this would sound more pleasant, less scratchy. We heard that the last two notes here played at the tip of the bow were shorter and weaker than the notes preceding it. This is because the violist did not, as we can see, there's not a lot of pronation happening where the first finger needs to put weight into the stick by the pronation of the arm so that when you're at the tip you still have as much weight in the string as you do with the frog. So because they're not pronating in and keeping that weight in, these notes came out as lighter and shorter. On the accents being played, the accents that are popping out from this run of notes, there needs to be a little bit more weight in the string so that we don't hear as much twang and scratch like we just did, but we hear just a big explosion of pitch, if maybe a little bit of bite on the note. If you do an accent and do a fast bow speed without also digging in the string, you're just going to whiff the string and get extraneous noise, not pitch. In each of these small scalar passages, the violist needs to make sure that they are not playing the top note too short. That note should musically be a little bit emphasized, but at the very least, it should be as long as all the other notes. The violist needs to sustain these chords that she just played all the way to the tip. And then even after taking the bow off the string, keep the left hand down for a moment so that they really ring. What we heard was a really strong start and then a taper, but this is a large cadence and musically these need to be very regally presented and very almost organ-like in their sustained nature. We hear scratchy notes, fast notes being played on the high A string of the viola here. This is because there's not enough weight in the bow for this high string, especially at the location slightly closer to the fingerboard that she's playing it. Because there isn't enough weight, the bow is not properly making contact, and it's just scratching the surface of the string. The violists did a great job of executing this crescendo by moving the bow closer to the bridge. The violist is moving their bow a little bit too quick as they are crossing the strings in these slurs. They have to make sure that there's a slightly slower bow speed right at the change so that there is easier contact made with the string that they are changing to, crossing to. So the reason that we're hearing some of this scratching is because the bow is moving too fast and it's not able to properly catch the string that it is rotating to. There's a good sustain of tone and preservation of length of bow because the violist is playing close to the bridge with a slow bow, so that's the right thing to do. We need a little bit more bow on this open C string in this slurred figure so that it really resonates and we can hear the chord being built by this arpeggio. We're hearing the sound and the resonance kind of taper out here when that is not the musical intention. This is because the violist is not playing close enough to the bridge with a slow enough bow, so they're running out of bow because they're trying to conserve it as it's being expended too quickly close to the fingerboard. Because when you're closer to the fingerboard, there's not as much tension on the string and you have to use more bow. So if she moved closer to the bridge, there would be more tension on the string. She could save bow, use a slower bow, and get more tone. You'll notice he's doing a good job here of keeping the bow on an even plane so that both the higher and lower string of this double stop are heard equally. We need more length on the A string notes because they are sounding more shrill and quieter than the notes on the lower strings. We need more length on these lower notes so that they will speak as much as the higher notes. This is a great example of crescendoing on a down bow near the tip and pronating in to keep the weight increasing as they get to the tip. That's why they're able to get this good crescendo here. So it's exactly what we want to see. In these fast notes right here, in between the long notes, we need a slower bow speed and a little bit more pressure so that the notes aren't scratching but they're catching the string. The violist is rushing slightly right here. This note being played on the high string of the viola sounds too thin, slightly too scratchy. That's because the violist is using too quick of a bow and too close to the fingerboard. So ideally they would be playing closer to the bridge using less bow on the preceding lower strings and more bow on this high string high note. Through this passage where the bow stroke and rhythm stays exactly the same, but the violist is changing from low strings to high strings, they need to elongate the bow strokes on the higher strings and shorten them on the lower strings so that the lower strings aren't sounding louder and fuller than the higher strings like they are right here. The violist is rushing through this slurred passage. The violist needs to be more exacting with their string crossings in these slurs. We are hearing strings being played at the same time as they are rotating for this string crossing. Even though one would think it has to be a smooth rotation, it actually has to be multiple quick rotations right to the next string within one bow stroke so that we're only playing one string at a time and we don't hear these double stops happening because that's not what's written. We need a wider vibrato here. This vibrato is really only visible but not audible. So relax the left hand and allow for a wider oscillation of pitch. Through this last fast passage, we hear that the down bows were heavier than the up bows. This is because the violist was using too much first finger. You can see how the first finger is kind of hooked onto the bow right now. Too much first finger to initiate this fast bow stroke, and not enough arm, and not enough for the natural bounce of the bow. So if you rely on finer muscles before it's fast enough to rely on them, like in this case, you're going to get a more inconsistent sound. Whereas if you rely on larger muscles, like the wrist or even larger to the arm, you're going to get a more even bow stroke. We're hearing a lot of scratching in these fast bow strokes. That's because the violist is using slightly too fast of a bow and isn't allowing the hair to really catch the string on each note. So what we're hearing is the hair skating across the string instead of just pulling vibration out of the string. So a slower bow would fix this problem of scratchy fast notes. On the low note played on the G string in this repeating passage here, we need a little bit more length and a little bit less attack on the note. Right now we hear them pop out as a slightly more articulate and shorter note, and we need to hear them blend completely into this line. This is a great example of technical lack of ability getting in the way of a musical line. We have to always put the musical idea first and not let technique get in the way of that. In order to get the vibrato to sound natural and wide up in this register of the viola, the motion has to be moving the actual last knuckle of the third finger back and forth, not just shaking the rest of the hand. The violist here created this very narrow sounding vibrato by shaking her whole hand, but she did not actually allow that rocking of the hand to bend the knuckle back and forth on that third finger. So she needs to loosen up and she needs to make sure that the motion is moving strictly toward and away from the bridge so that she can get that wide oscillation of pitch in a loose natural sounding vibrato. As the violists moved to the tip in that long bow stroke that they just played, we lost volume and it naturally tapered out because they did not pronate enough and put weight into the first finger as they moved out to the tip. So then we just heard the natural decrescendo that a bow will do if you don't add in weight progressively toward the tip. So the correct thing to do is, as they're pulling out toward the tip, add in weight with the first finger so that the note remains a consistent volume. We're not quite able to hear the middle note of this arpeggio, and that's because the violist is rushing slightly, and they're not using quite enough bow on it. So they need to stay right in tempo, a little bit slower, and make sure that they're really pulling the bow through those string crossings and not waiting until they get to the highest note on the highest string of this slur to use a lot of bow. We notice that as the violist gets to the tip, their bow starts to be less straight. We can see that it's at a bit of an angle here where it should be instead perfectly perpendicular to the strings. This is because there isn't any bend in the wrist as they are moving outward on a down bow toward the tip. The correct thing to do would be to begin to bend the wrist and flex with the fingers so that your arm can move outwards but the bow can stay straight. Naturally, you have to push the bow further out from your arm and your hand as you move outwards because the bend in the arm will not move straight. It wants to rotate this way. We're hearing a bit of scratchiness and a bit of loss of clarity in this section that just happened. And this is because if we look at the left hand here, we can see that there's a lot of extra motion and extra tension in the hand. We can see that the first finger is completely extended, and then we can see that the second finger and the fourth finger are both raised up pretty high off of the strings. These are all indicators that the hand is tight and is clenching the neck. And then also, reaching these fingers out so far just creates more space, which then creates more time needed to come from that position back to the string to play the next notes. So ideally, we would want to see the fingers closer to the string, even when they're not playing. And we wouldn't want to see any of these fingers extended out, especially fully extended, with tension because this is just going to make it less accurate and less mobile around the viola. The instrument being played in this video is a viola, not a violin. This is too aggressive for Bach. What I mean by aggressive is too much bite on each note and a little bit too much length on each note in terms of how long they are speaking. So in order to get the forte volume without getting aggressive, the viola should be relying more on weight and less on pronation. We can see that she's very far out to the tip, even in this loud section. The further we are on the tip, we have to press, we have to pronate to get the weight in. And while it is possible to do this without accenting and choking the sound, it's much more difficult. It would be a lot easier if they attempted to stay in the middle of the bow, where they could get more accurate articulation just by using weight. And they would still have room on either side of the bow to move if there was an uneven bowing passage.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}

He's got two hands on it, love that. He's strong with it, it's balanced. His eyes are up. Again, he's choosing not to square all the way, but kind of drive deep baseline and shoot it back up over that shoulder. Again, here's that shot over the right shoulder, follow through. Again, he's pretty accurate here. Good push off here on that left foot, raising of the right knee, got that arm bar up, see that arm, that head comes off as he raises the basketball up. But it seems like he's got a really good look here, good landing, cushion, knees bent. Here's his follow-through back over that right shoulder. Again, keep that ball in tight. Try not to stick it out here, but good footwork here, stepping on that left foot to raise the right leg, eyes and head are up. Again, he's choosing to come back over that left shoulder, if you will, and not square up. Again, see how he sticks the ball out here? Again, it could be stripped by a defender, so you got to keep it in tight and protect it and take it straight up. Takes one big dribble. Footwork here is set up with that dribble. Again, you know, I wish he'd keep it a little more tucked in here. He's kind of sticking it out here. I love that his eyes and head are up. Put beautiful footwork and timing. Takes that left hand off the ball, but keeps it up there to kind of protect the ball, balance out his body. Here he raises the basketball up. Does a great job of keeping his eye on his target. Here's, see this right shoulder is not facing the basket. He's shooting it up over the shoulder. It's not my preferred way of shooting a reverse layup, but a lot of people shoot it this way. It's quick, especially when you're driving like deep baseline. Here's the baseline when you're dribbling down this way. That's a lot of times how people shoot it back over that shoulder. But he's got his hand spread, balls out in front of that hand. Here's one dribble. He picks it up. Better job of keeping it in the middle of his body, not sticking it out. Here comes the footwork. Right, right, left. Eyes are up. Yeah, here's the follow-through. Shoots it up over that right shoulder. Again, has a pretty good aim and target here. Beautiful landing. Knees bent. Seat down. Eyes up. Here, see, this is a good look, but he's got really good lift, footwork here. Again, in this type example of the reverse layup, he's not squaring his body, but he's shooting it back over his head. But the ball comes off those fingers nicely. It's under control and stable because he had two hands on it as he lifted the basketball. Again, right hand reverse layup, one dribble move, plant the left, pull the right up, arm bars bent, left arm bent, raising the ball up with that right hand. Again, he's choosing to kind of shoot it back over that right shoulder. I prefer you square and face your target. See how he shoots back over that arm, that shoulder. He's not really squaring up. See his hip, shoulder, they're not facing the basket or the baseline, but he's choosing to shoot it up over that shoulder. Nice lift and follow through here. He's starting in tight, takes one dribble, and has one big step, which is really a good way to learn how to do a reverse layup. Good foot, one dribble move, foot plant on that left foot, followed by the right knee. Again, let's get this ball in close. Let's not leave it out here on this left hip. So, the quicker we dribble and get it into this position in front of our body, the better off we are. Great job with his head and eyes being up. Here the shooter is shooting a going left to right, shooting a right hand reverse layup. He took one dribble. I love the fact that he's got two hands on the ball, but instead of sticking it out here to the left or down low, I'd love for him to keep it more in tight to the body and chest to protect it and be strong with it. He does a great job of lifting his head and eyes, pretty good footwork as well here. Beautiful foot placement, raising of the right knee. Here he's lifting the ball. I love that he keeps two hands on it. It's so important to maintain control and to be strong. Eyes are up. See how he's driving deep baseline? Here's the baseline. Good look here. Here's the look. And this is what I mean. And a lot of people shoot it this way. I prefer to square this right shoulder to the backboard. He's shooting, he's not squaring this right shoulder. He's shooting it up over the shoulder. Gotta stay with it. Gotta keep your eyes on that target. It's a tough shot to take and make. Again, follow through over that right shoulder. Again, another way to shoot a reverse layup. Not my preferred way. Maybe that's why I gave him an 8, but it does a great job of hitting the target here. Again, shoots over that right shoulder. He just doesn't square the shoulders and the hips. Ideally, I would love probably to see that way of shooting is squaring and being more fundamental. He kind of shoots it back over that right shoulder. And you can see that motion here. It looks like he's going to hit target here. Again, really doing a good job of hitting the target. Here's that shot over that right shoulder. Bends the knees on the landing. Here's the foot plant, the planting of the left foot, nice cover of distance here, comes that right leg in behind. Again, let's get the ball in tight, sticking it out here. Great job of knowing where he is in relation to the backboard by having his eyes and head up. Again, good timing footwork here, stepping on the left, pulling the right knee. So he's raising it up with two hands. He's being really strong with it. The ball's stable. Good look here. He chooses to go off the left foot, raise that right knee. He's kind of shooting over this right shoulder. You can kind of see that and in some cases that's how some people shoot a reverse layup. I prefer to square that right shoulder on that plant of the left foot and be more fundamental here, but in some cases this is how the reverse layup is shot.", "proficiency_level": "Intermediate Expert"}
